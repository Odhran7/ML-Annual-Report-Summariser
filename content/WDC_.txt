 item 1a   risk factors 

our business can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause material harm to our actual operating results and financial condition the risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but represent risks that we believe are material to us additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also negatively affect our business 

operational risks 

adverse global or regional conditions could harm our business 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and many of our products and components are produced overseas as a result our business depends significantly on global and regional conditions adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions including but not limited to volatility in the financial markets tighter credit recession inflation rising interest rates slower growth in certain geographic regions political uncertainty geopolitical tensions or conflicts other macroeconomic factors changes to social conditions and regulations could significantly harm demand for our products increase credit and collectability risks result in revenue reductions reduce profitability as a result of underutilization of our assets cause us to change our business practices increase manufacturing and operating costs or result in impairment charges or other expenses 

our revenue growth is significantly dependent on the growth of international markets and we may face challenges in international sales markets we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of contract manufacturers including 

• obtaining governmental approvals and compliance with evolving foreign regulations 

• the need to comply with regulations on international business including the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 the antibribery laws of other countries and rules regarding conflict minerals 

• exchange currency and tax controls and reallocations 

• weaker protection of ip rights 

• trade restrictions such as export controls export bans import restrictions embargoes sanctions license and certification requirements including semiconductor encryption and other technology tariffs and complex customs regulations and 

• difficulties in managing international operations including appropriate internal controls 

as a result of these risks our business could be harmed 

public health crises including the covid19 pandemic have had and could in the future have a negative effect on our business 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our strategic partners customers suppliers and logistics providers these impacts include underabsorbed overhead increased logistics component and other costs decreased demand for our products and manufacturing challenges while our manufacturing facilities and those used by flash ventures are all currently operational we have experienced and may experience in the future temporary closures of certain manufacturing facilities related to the pandemic future outbreaks of infectious disease or other public health crises may have a similar impact 

the effects of such health crises including the covid19 pandemic are uncertain and difficult to predict but may include 

• disruptions to our supply chain our operations or those of our strategic partners customers or suppliers caused by employees or others contracting infectious diseases or governmental orders to contain the spread of infectious disease such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders trade controls and business shutdowns 

• deterioration of worldwide credit markets that may limit our ability or increase our cost to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to customer credit defaults 

• extreme volatility in financial markets which may harm our ability to access the financial markets on acceptable terms 

• increased data security and technology risk as some employees continue to work from home including possible outages to systems and technologies critical to remote work and increased data privacy risk with cybercriminals attempting to take advantage of the disruption and 

• reduced productivity or other disruptions of our operations if workers in our factories or our other worksites are exposed to or spread infectious diseases to other employees 

the degree to which the covid19 pandemic or future public health crises ultimately impact our business will depend on many factors beyond our control which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 

we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical services materials or components and a disruption in our supply chain could negatively affect our business 

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware preamps controllers dynamic randomaccess memory components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing chip assembly product assembly and product testing and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our worldwide justintime hubs and distribution centers and to meet our freight needs many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we therefore depend on these suppliers to meet our business needs including dedicating adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products 

our suppliers have in the past been and may in the future be unable or unwilling to meet our requirements including as a result of events outside of their control such as trade restrictions including tariffs quotas and embargoes geopolitical conflicts public health emergencies or natural disasters if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers or if we cannot purchase materials at a reasonable price we may not be able to meet demand for our products trade restrictions including tariffs quotas and embargoes demand from other highvolume industries for materials or components used in our products disruptions in supplier relationships or shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in increased costs to us or decreased demand for our products which could negatively impact our business delays shortages or cost increases experienced by our suppliers in developing or sourcing materials and components for use in our products or incompatibility or quality issues relating to our products could also harm our business 

we do not have longterm contracts with some of our existing suppliers nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers so we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our products any significant problems that occur at our suppliers could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems when we do have contractual commitments with suppliers in an effort to stabilize the supply of our components those commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components or make significant cash advances to the supplier and may not result in a satisfactory supply of our components 

in addition our supply base has experienced industry consolidation our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors decide to exit the industry or redirect their investments and increase costs to us in addition some of our suppliers have experienced a decline in financial performance where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation or a decline in financial performance is increased some of our suppliers may also be competitors in other areas of our business which could lead to difficulties in price negotiations or meeting our supply requirements 

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are subject to substantial risk of damage or disruption 

we conduct our operations at large highvolume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere if a fire including a climate changerelated fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as a power outage contamination event terrorist attack cybersecurity incident physical security breach political instability civil unrest localized labor unrest or other employment issues or a health epidemic negatively affects any of these facilities it would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and source components and harm our business possible impacts include work and equipment stoppages and damage to or closure of our 

facilities or those of our suppliers or customers for an indefinite period of time climate change has in the past and is expected to continue to increase the incidence and severity of certain natural disasters in addition the geographic concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from any of these problems 

we may incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the scope of the coverage of our insurance policies there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially due to market availability pricing or other reasons we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some cases no coverage at all for natural disasters and damage to our facilities as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost climate change may reduce the availability andor increase the cost of certain types of insurance by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of certain natural disasters we depend upon kioxia to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash ventures if kioxia fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses and such failure could also cause flash ventures to breach various financing covenants 

the loss of our key management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace changes in our key management team can result in loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge departure of other key employees disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods global competition for skilled employees in the technology industry is intense and our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to implement succession plans for our key management and staff to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees additionally uncertainty about the structure and organization of our business as a result of our ongoing strategic review could negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain key staff and skilled employees changes in immigration policies may also impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent 

our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business including through equity compensation when our operating results are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees if we are unable to hire and retain key management staff or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems design defects or sustain system failures our business could be negatively impacted 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may obtain in the future access to our computer systems and networks including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of some of our suppliers vendors service providers cloud solution providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks cyber attacks can include ransomware computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks and covert introduction of malware to computers and networks including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time cyber attacks may also include impersonation of authorized users efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage in some instances efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent attacks may reduce the performance of our computer systems and networks which could negatively impact our business we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are increasingly organized and wellfinanced or supported by state actors and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create heightened risk of cyber attacks 

our products are also targets for cyber attacks including those products utilized in cloudbased environments as well as our cloud service offerings while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers further our products contain sophisticated 

hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects exposing us to litigation and indemnification claims and hurting our reputation 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result of actual or perceived breaches we could experience additional costs notification requirements civil and administrative fines and penalties indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated litigation or indemnification claims 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur including as a result of thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate in our products which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition product defects product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships lost revenue indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products warranty claims litigation or loss of market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provisions do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant they could harm our business 

business and strategic risks 

our review of potential strategic alternatives may not result in an executed or consummated transaction or other strategic alternative and the process of reviewing strategic alternatives or its conclusion could adversely affect our business and our stockholders 

in june 2022 we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing longterm value for our stockholders the potential strategic alternatives include among other things the option to separate our flash and hdd business units in conjunction with that review process the company announced that it had entered into a letter agreement with elliott investment management lp “elliott” which had disclosed in may 2022 a 1 billion investment in our company and called for a full strategic review of our business we are actively working with financial advisors and the company’s legal counsel in this strategic review process 

any potential transaction or other strategic alternative would be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control including among other things market conditions industry trends regulatory approvals and the availability of financing for a potential transaction on reasonable terms the process of reviewing potential strategic alternatives may be time consuming distracting and disruptive to our business operations which may cause concern to our current or potential customers employees investors strategic partners and other constituencies and may have a material impact on our business and operating results andor result in increased volatility in our share price we have and will continue to incur substantial 

expenses associated with identifying evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives there can be no assurance that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative if consummated will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock until the review process is concluded perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners similarly other activist investors may engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to affect changes and assert influence on our board and management which could lead to the impacts on our business board management and employees discussed above 

we rely substantially on strategic relationships with various partners including kioxia which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business 

we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into strategic relationships with various partners for product development manufacturing sales growth and the supply of technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing including our business ventures with kioxia we depend on flash ventures for the development and manufacture of flashbased memory our strategic relationships including flash ventures are subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments our revenue and costs our future rate of spending our technology plans and our future growth opportunities 

substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by flash ventures which limits our ability to respond to market demand and supply changes and makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations a failure to accurately forecast supply and demand could cause us to overinvest or underinvest in technology transitions or the expansion of flash ventures’ capacity overinvestment by us or our competitors could result in excess supply which could cause significant decreases in our product prices significant excess obsolete inventory or inventory writedowns or underutilization charges and the potential impairment of our investments in flash ventures we are contractually obligated to pay for 50 of the fixed costs of flash ventures regardless of whether we order any flashbased memory and our orders placed with flash ventures on a threemonth rolling basis are binding on the other hand if we underinvest in flash ventures or otherwise grow or transition flash ventures’ capacity too slowly we may not have enough supply of flashbased memory or the right type of flashbased memory to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis and we may lose opportunities for revenue gross margin and market share as a result if our supply is limited we might make strategic decisions with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers which could result in less favorable gross margins or damage customer relationships 

our control over the operations of our business ventures may be limited and our interests could diverge from our strategic partners’ interests regarding ongoing and future activities for example under the flash ventures agreements we cannot unilaterally direct most of flash ventures’ activities and we have limited ability to source or fabricate flash outside of flash ventures flash ventures requires significant investments by both kioxia and us for technology transitions and capacity expansions and our business could be harmed if our technology roadmap and investment plans are not sufficiently aligned with kioxia’s lack of alignment with kioxia with respect to flash ventures could negatively impact our ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancement misalignment could arise due to changes in kioxia’s strategic priorities management ownership andor access to capital which have changed in recent years and could continue to change kioxia’s stakeholders may include or have included in the past competitors customers a private equity firm government entities andor public stockholders kioxia’s management changes ownership and capital structure could lead to delays in decisionmaking disputes or changes in strategic direction that could negatively impact the strategic partnership and therefore us there may exist conflicts of interest between kioxia’s stakeholders and flash ventures or us with respect to among other things protecting and growing flash ventures’ business ip and competitively sensitive confidential information 

together with kioxia we fund a portion of the investments required for flash ventures through lease financings continued availability of lease financings for flash ventures is not guaranteed and could be limited by several factors including our andor kioxia’s financial performance and changes to our andor kioxia’s business ownership or corporate structure to the extent that lease financings are not accessible on favorable terms or at all more cash would be required to fund investments 

our strategic relationships are subject to additional risks that could harm our business including but not limited to the following 

• failure by our strategic partners to comply with applicable laws 

• difficulties and delays in product and technology development at ramping production at and transferring technology to our strategic partners 

• failure by our strategic partners to timely fund capital investments with us or otherwise meet their commitments including paying amounts owed to us or third parties when due 

• we may lose the rights to or ability to independently manufacture certain technology or products being developed or manufactured by strategic partners including if any of them is acquired by another company files for bankruptcy or experiences financial or other losses 

• a bankruptcy event involving a strategic partner could result in structural changes to andor termination of the strategic partnership and 

• changes in tax or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes to the agreements governing our strategic partnerships 

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining average selling prices “asps” volatile demand rapid technological change and industry consolidation as well as lengthy product qualifications all of which could negatively impact our business 

demand for our devices software and solutions which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period the prices of our products are influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand in the storage market including the effects of new fab capacity macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors the storage market has experienced volatile product life cycles which can harm our ability to recover the cost of product development and periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories significant reductions in asps and negative impacts on our revenue and gross margins 

further our asps and gross margins tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales to lower priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of revenue rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence finally the data storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years which could enhance the resources and lower the cost structure of some competitors these factors could result in a substantial decrease in our market share and harm our business 

as we compete in new product areas the overall complexity of our business may increase and may result in increases in rd expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability we must also qualify our products with customers through potentially lengthy testing processes with uncertain results some of our competitors offer products that we do not offer which may allow them to win sales from us and some of our customers may be developing storage solutions internally which may reduce their demand for our products we expect that competition will continue to be intense and our competitors may be able to gain a product offering or cost structure advantage over us which would harm our business further our competitors may utilize pricing strategies including offering products at prices at or below cost that we may be unable to competitively match we may also have difficulty effectively competing with manufacturers benefiting from governmental investments and may be subject to increased complexity and reduced efficiency in our supply chain as a result of governmental efforts to promote domestic semiconductor industries in various jurisdictions 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions and product development and introduction our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the markets for our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate to adapt our existing products or develop new products effectively if we fail to implement new technologies or develop new products desired by our customers quickly and costeffectively our business may be harmed 

in addition the success of our technology transitions and product development depends on a number of other factors including 

• rd expenses and results 

• difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp 

• market acceptancequalification 

• effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand 

• the vertical integration of some of our products which may result in more capital expenditures and greater fixed costs than if we were not vertically integrated 

• our ability to cost effectively respond to customer requests for new products or features including requests for more efficient and efficientlyproduced products with reduced environmental impacts and software associated with our products 

• our ability to increase our software development capability and 

• the effectiveness of our gotomarket capability in selling new products 

moving to new technologies and products may require us to align to and build a new supply base our success in new product areas may depend on our ability to enter into favorable supply agreements in addition if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting technologies to implement these new technologies are not available we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position 

additionally new products could substitute for our current products and make them obsolete we also develop products to meet certain industry and technical standards which may change and cause us to incur substantial costs as we adapt to new standards or invest in different manufacturing processes to remain competitive 

we experience sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate in addition accurately forecasting demand has become more difficult which could harm our business 

sales of many of our products tend to be seasonal and subject to supplydemand cycles changes in seasonal and cyclical supply and demand patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns for example we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of each quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of financial results for a given quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results 

the variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on accurately forecasting market and customer demand for our products accurately forecasting demand has also become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers due to volatility in global economic conditions end market dynamics and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our oem customers utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand we could experience periods of product oversupply excess inventory and price decreases which could impact our sales asps and gross margin thereby negatively affecting our operating results and our financial condition if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

failure to successfully execute on strategic initiatives including acquisitions divestitures or cost saving measures may negatively impact our future results 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and engage in cost saving measures acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must 

continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees and integration of processes and systems we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all there have been and may continue to be difficulties with implementing new systems and processes or with integrating systems and processes of companies with complex operations which can result in inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and may increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective 

failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition or changes in technology development and related roadmaps following an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition acquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our stockholders as well as earnout or other contingent consideration payments and the issuance of additional indebtedness that would put additional pressure on liquidity furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could negatively affect our business in addition new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest with or in certain other countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so including investments in joint ventures minority investments and outbound technology transfers to certain countries 

cost saving measures restructurings and divestitures may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our manufacturing or other facilities as a result of these actions we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods these actions could also impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that these actions will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or consolidations or that we do not forego future business opportunities as a result of these actions 

loss of revenue from a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

historically nearly one half of our total revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance we have experienced and may in the future experience events such as the loss of a key customer prohibition or restriction of sales to a key customer by law regulation or other government action reductions in sales to or orders by a key customer customer requirements to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs or the acquisition of a key customer by one of our competitors these events have impacted and may in the future impact our operating results and financial condition further government authorities may implement laws or regulations or take other actions that could result in significant changes to the business or operating models of our customers such changes could negatively impact our operating results 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could negatively impact our profitability consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products increased customer pressure on our prices replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as cloud storage and computing platforms mobile social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could negatively impact our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

sales in the distribution channel and to the retail market are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes within these markets or maintain and grow our applicable market share our business could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product as a result of the shift to mobile devices more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our business could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel our operating results would be negatively impacted negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances 

a significant portion of our sales is also made through retailers our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple retail market channels particularly in the retail market negative publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors further changes to the retail environment such as store closures caused by macroeconomic conditions or changing customer preferences may reduce the demand for our products if customers no longer maintain a preference for our product brands or if our retailers are not successful in selling our products our operating results may be negatively impacted 

financial risks 

our level of debt may negatively impact our liquidity restrict our operations and ability to respond to business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

we utilize debt financing in our capital structure and may incur additional debt including under our revolving credit facility subject to customary conditions in our loan agreement our level of debt could have significant consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes 

• imposing financial and other restrictive covenants on our operations including limiting our ability to i consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person ii enter into saleleaseback transactions iii incur additional indebtedness and iv incur liens and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures or take advantage of new opportunities to grow our business 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations comply with our debt covenants and deleverage depends on our cash flows and financial performance which are affected by financial business economic and other factors the rate at which we will be able to or choose to deleverage is uncertain failure to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness we may be unable to cure or obtain a waiver of an event of default or otherwise amend our debt agreements to prevent an event of default thereunder on terms acceptable to us or at all in that event the debt holders could accelerate the related debt which may result in the crossacceleration or crossdefault of other debt leases or other obligations we may not have sufficient funds available to repay accelerated indebtedness and we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities which we may be unable to do on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could harm our business refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs 

as our bank debt contains a variable interest rate component based on our corporate credit ratings a decline in our ratings could result in increased interest rates and debt service obligations in addition our ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies as to our 

financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

we also guarantee a significant amount of lease obligations of flash ventures owed to third parties flash ventures sells to and leases back a portion of its equipment from a consortium of financial institutions most of the lease obligations are guaranteed 50 by us and 50 by kioxia some of the lease obligations are guaranteed in full by us the leases are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors if a cancellation event were to occur flash ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us increased interest rates or waiver fees if a resolution is not reached we may be required to pay all of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 

we may from time to time seek to further refinance our substantial indebtedness by issuing additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into common stock or grant the holder the right to purchase common stock each of which may dilute our existing stockholders reduce the value of our common stock or both 

tax matters may materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

changes in tax laws in the united states the european union and around the globe have impacted and will continue to impact our effective worldwide tax rate which may materially affect our financial position and results of operations further organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities including cash movements could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business beginning in our fiscal year 2023 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the year incurred requiring amortization in accordance with irc section 174 if this requirement is not repealed or otherwise modified it will materially increase our effective tax rate and reduce our operating cash flows additionally portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met we may not be able to meet such conditions if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future 

our determination of our tax liability in the us and other jurisdictions is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as disclosed in part i item 1 note 14 income tax expense of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in litigation or the payment of significant amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may harm our business 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue cost of revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin in addition our purchases of flashbased memory from flash ventures and our investment in flash ventures are denominated in japanese yen if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar our cost of purchasing flashbased memory wafers and the cost to us of future capital funding of flash ventures would increase when such events occur they have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the us therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the us fluctuations in currency exchanges 

rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could negatively impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the us 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place thus our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and may actually harm our operating results further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions operating losses third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks our customers’ credit risk may also be exacerbated by an economic downturn or other adverse global or regional economic conditions any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use sharing and security of data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security and privacy of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data and employee data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings laws and regulations relating to the collection use security and privacy of thirdparty data change over time and new laws and regulations become effective from time to time we are subject to notice and privacy policy requirements as well as obligations to respond to requests to know and access personal information correct personal information delete personal information and say no to the sale of personal information global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction we may also be subject to restrictions on crossborder data transfers and requirements for localized storage of data that could increase our compliance costs and risks and affect the ability of our global operations to coordinate activities and respond to customers compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

we are subject to state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor health and safety trade and publiccompany reporting and disclosure regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the responsible business alliance “rba” and compliance with those regulations and requirements could cause an increase in our operating costs and failure to comply may harm our business 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health and safety practices and publiccompany reporting and disclosures requirements these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers customers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products which could impair our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions or with certain customers and harm our operating results in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future which could substantially increase the complexity of our publiccompany reporting and disclosure requirements and our compliance and operating costs if we or our suppliers customers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation certain customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which could harm our business 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the rba the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we or our suppliers customers or partners were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer 

w e and certain of our officers are at times involved in litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which may be costly may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings fines or penalties which could materially harm our business 

from time to time we are involved in litigation including antitrust and commercial matters putative securities class action suits and other actions we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others some of the actions seek injunctive relief including injunctions against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business from time to time we may also be the subject of inquiries requests for information investigations and actions by government and regulatory agencies regarding our businesses any such matters could result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including fines penalties or restrictions on our business activities 

litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations in the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation investigation or governmental proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities including the manufacture use and sale of products with or without merit such matters can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by us could also result in counterclaims against us which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us in addition litigation investigations or governmental proceedings and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel affect demand for our products and harm the market prices of our securities 

we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation investigations or governmental proceedings these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits the cost of governmental law enforcement or regulatory investigations or proceedings civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measures if any which may be imposed 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other ip rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we have historically been involved in frequent disputes regarding patent and other ip rights and we have in the past received and we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other ip rights we may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license ip to others ip risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no ip protection as a defense against litigation the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of ip litigation increase the ip risks we face litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may be subject to injunctions enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may harm our business 

if we incorporate thirdparty technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the ip of others we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier customer or partner could negatively impact our business 

moreover from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged ip infringement the scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses including attorneys’ fees we may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business 

our reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key components of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable ip such as our process technology we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes there can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us it is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection there are entities whom we believe may infringe our ip enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our ip to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered ip rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

the success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands we believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products any occurrence of counterfeiting imitation or confusion with our brands could negatively affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands which in turn could negatively impact sales of our branded products our share and our gross margin as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution 

the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company or its directors officers or other employees 

our bylaws provide that unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company ii any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director officer or other employee of the company or its stockholders iii any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or the company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the “delaware exclusive forum provision” our bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the united states of america will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “federal forum provision” 

the delaware exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the exchange act or the securities act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction in addition the federal forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under the securities act and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the exchange act the exclusive forum provisions in the company’s bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and accordingly actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal courts our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations 

the exclusive forum provisions in the company’s bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the company or its directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits against the company and its directors officers and other employees in addition stockholders who do bring a claim in the court of chancery of the state of delaware pursuant to the delaware exclusive forum provision could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim particularly if they do not reside in or near delaware the court in the designated forum under our exclusive forum provisions may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the company than to our stockholders further the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that a court could find any of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings if a court were to find all or any part of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions

key developments 

business structure and strategic alternatives 

in 2021 we made and announced the decision to reorganize our business by forming two separate product business units flash and hdd the new structure is intended to provide each business unit with focus and responsibility for identifying current and future customer requirements while driving the strategy roadmap pricing and overall profitability for their respective product areas to align with the new operating model and business structure we made management organizational changes and implemented new reporting modules and processes to provide discrete information to manage the business effective july 3 2021 management finalized its assessment of our operating segments and concluded that we now have two reportable segments flash and hdd 

in june 2022 we announced that we are reviewing potential strategic alternatives aimed at further optimizing longterm value for stockholders the executive committee of our board of directors is overseeing the assessment process and evaluating a range of alternatives including options for separating our flash and hdd business units in conjunction with that review process we announced that we had entered into a letter agreement with elliott investment management lp “elliott” which had disclosed in may 2022 a 1 billion investment in our company and called for a full strategic review of our business we are actively working with financial advisors and our legal counsel in this strategic review process

flash ventures contamination incident 

in february 2022 contamination of certain material used in manufacturing processes occurred at flash ventures’ fabrication facilities in both yokkaichi and kitakami japan which resulted in damage to inventory units in production a temporary disruption to production operations and a reduction in our flash wafer availability during 2022 we incurred charges of 207 million related to this contamination incident that were recorded in cost of revenue and primarily consisted of scrapped inventory and rework costs decontamination and other costs needed to restore the facilities to normal capacity and under absorption of overhead costs we are evaluating potential options for recovery 

financing activities 

during 2022 we continued to execute on our commitment to reduce our overall debt levels and fitch ratings inc raised our company credit rating to investment grade in december 2021 we fully repaid our term loan b4 in october 2021 and shortly thereafter initiated a series of transactions to further reduce our debt levels and better stagger the maturities of our debt in december 2021 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 2850 senior unsecured notes due february 1 2029 the “ 2029 notes ” and we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3100 senior unsecured notes due february 1 2032 the “ 2032 notes ” we used the proceeds from these note offerings and available cash to voluntarily repay 121 billion of our term loan a1 and reduce the principal amount to 30 billion as of december 31 2021 in january 2022 we amended and restated our existing loan agreement to provide for among other things i the issuance of a new 30 billion term loan a2 maturing in january 2027 to replace our previously existing term loan a1 ii the availability of a new 225 billion revolving credit facility maturing in january 2027 to replace our previously existing 225 billion revolving credit facility and iii additional covenant flexibility and other modifications as of july 1 2022 over 80 of the principal amount of our debt is now due in 2026 or later we believe this new debt structure gives us greater financial stability and flexibility to manage our business over the longer term 

additional information regarding our indebtedness including the principal repayment terms interest rates covenants and other key terms of our outstanding indebtedness is included in part ii item 8 note 8 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

new flash ventures fabrication facility 

in january 2022 we entered into additional agreements regarding flash ventures’ investment in a new wafer fabrication facility currently under construction in yokkaichi japan referred to as “y7” the primary purpose of y7 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flashbased wafer capacity to newer flash technology nodes the first phase of construction of y7 is complete and output is expected to commence in the first half of 2023 we are committed to pay among other items future building depreciation prepayments of approximately 268 million in 2023 and 22 million in 2024 to be credited against future wafer charges 

covid19 pandemic and operational update 

as the ongoing covid19 pandemic has evolved we have implemented and maintained more thorough sanitation practices as outlined by health organizations and supported vaccination efforts we continually monitor and update our practices based on recommendations from health organizations to ensure the continued safety of our employees and business partners in addition the responses to covid19 taken by others in the supply chain have contributed to the increases in the costs of their services which have in turn impacted our operations we incurred incremental charges primarily related to logistics absorption and other factoryrelated costs of approximately 248 million and 127 million  during 2022 and 2021 respectively which were recorded in cost of revenue 

the technology hardware and semiconductor industries faced supply chain disruptions and component shortages during 2022 which negatively impacted both our customers’ ability to ship products and our ability to build products in order to meet our end customers’ demand we are incurring increased component costs which primarily impacted our hard drive gross margins in 2022 additionally the global economy has recently experienced significant volatility and disruptions impacted by increases in inflation rates russia’s invasion of ukraine and rising fuel prices rising interest rates declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth and uncertainty about economic stability we are seeing our pc oem customers aggressively rightsize their inventory to reflect current demand conditions which will impact our business in this market in the second half of the calendar year while we ultimately expect that the impact of these conditions will be transitory the severity and duration of the impact of these conditions on our business is dynamic and cannot be predicted 

we believe we have made significant progress in strengthening our product portfolio to meet our customers’ growing and evolving storage needs our bics5 based products continue to play a significant role in driving top line results across our end markets as we move further along the product roadmap additionally optinand and shingled magnetic recording “smr” technologies are progressing as planned as we have commenced commercial shipments on a number of optinandbased products and are undergoing qualifications of our latest 26terabyte smr drive for our next generation 3dflash technology we continued commercial shipment of consumer flash devices based on our 162layer bics6 technology as we expect to start ramping the technology towards the end of calendar year 2022 we are also aware of the ongoing trends in the hdd client market as pcs shift from using hdd to flash technology as a result we have and are still undergoing actions to restructure our hdd manufacturing footprint to reflect this market dynamic 

we will continue to actively monitor these situations and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding the risks we face as a result of the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and current macroeconomic conditions

results of operations 

summary comparison of 2022 2021 and 2020 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and percentage of net revenue 1  



1 percentages may not total due to rounding 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented a summary of our segment information 



the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding our disaggregated revenue 



net revenue 

net revenue increase d 11  in 2022 compared to 2021 which reflects increases in exabytes of flash and hdd sold as further discussed below the net revenue increases driven by exabyte growth were partially offset by declines in the average price per gigabyte of storage for both flash and hdd as product mix shifted to more efficient highcapacity drives 

despite the temporary disruption to our flash production from the contamination event at flash ventures’ fabrication facilities in both yokkaichi and kitakami japan flash revenue increased 12 in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by a 21 increase in exabytes sold partially offset by a decline in the average price per gigabyte as product mix shifted to more efficient highcapacity drives the higher exabytes sold primarily reflected the growth in cloud and the ramp of our latest bics5 flash solutions higher volume was also driven by strong demand in gaming along with a growing brand recognition of wdblack based products in our consumer market 

hdd revenue increased 10 in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily driven by a 19 increase in exabytes sold partially offset by a decline in the average price per gigabyte as product mix shifted to more efficient highercapacity drives the increase in exabytes sold was due to continued demand for our latest generation energy assisted drives among our public and private cloud customers as discussed below the increase in cloud was partly offset by a decline in hdd exabytes sold in our client and consumer end markets due to continued pressure in the commercial channel related to component issues impacting our customers’ ability to ship product and greater component sourcing constraints within our own operations and customers transitioning to client ssd 

the increase in cloud revenue in 2022 compared to 2021 was led by the demand increase for hdd capacity enterprise drives including growth in our 18terabyte capacity drives and ramp of our 20terabyte and 22terabyte capacity drives additionally revenue from flash for enterprise ssd applications more than doubled in 2022 compared to 2021 in client the decrease in revenue in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily reflected a mid30 decrease in client hdd revenue as a result of the supply chain disruptions noted previously as well as lower shipments of pcs toward the end of 2022 partially offset by an increase in flash revenue due to the ramp of 5g phones in consumer the decrease in revenues in 2022 compared to 2021 reflected declines in hdd as a result of shortterm demand weakness tied to macroeconomic factors as well as covidrelated measures 

the changes in net revenue by geography in 2022 compared to 2021 are primarily related to growth in asia driven by the ramp in 5g products as well as routine variations in the mix of business 

for 2022 2021 and 2020 our top 10 customers accounted for 45  39 and 42 respectively of our net revenue for each of 2022 2021 and 2020 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2022 2021 and 2020 these programs represented 17 19 and 16 respectively of gross revenues and adjustments to revenue due to changes in accruals for these programs have generally averaged less than 1 of gross revenue over the last three years the amounts attributed to our sales incentive and marketing programs generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions list pricing strategies seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue 

gross profit and gross margin 

consolidated gross profit increased 135 billion or 30 in 2022 compared to 2021 which reflects the increase in revenue in both flash and hdd the shift in product mix to more efficient highercapacity drives and cost efficiencies as we ramped production on new products as well as a 265 million decrease in charges in the current period related to amortization expense on acquired intangible assets some of which became fully amortized these improvements were partially offset by the contamination related charges of 207 million noted above consolidated gross margin increased 46 percentage points over the prior year with flash gross margin up 62 percentage points and hdd gross margin up 24 percentage points which primarily reflected cost reductions as we ramped production on newer products consolidated gross margin also increased as a result of a shift in product mix to highermargin flash drives 

operating expenses 

rd expense increased 80 million in 2022 compared to 2021 as we continued to invest in new technologies the primary drivers of the yearoveryear change were increases in headcount and annual merit compensation which accounted for approximately 30 million of the overall increase as well as a similarly sized increase in material use due to an increase in projects 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense in 2022 was relatively flat compared to 2021 as we tightly managed costs in light of a dynamic macroeconomic environment 

the losses recognized in employee termination asset impairment and other charges compared to the gains in the prior year primarily reflect lower gains on the disposal of assets associated with our business realignment activities partially offset by higher employee termination and other charges associated with our business realignment activities for additional information regarding employee termination asset impairment and other charges see part ii item 8 note 16 employee termination asset impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

interest and other income expense 

the decreases in total interest and other expense net in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily reflects a decrease in interest expense resulting from the paydown of principal on our debt during 2022 

income tax expense 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” enacted on december 22 2017 includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 act during the second quarter of 2019 however the us treasury and the irs have issued tax guidance on certain provisions of the 2017 act since the enactment date and we anticipate the issuance of additional regulatory and interpretive guidance we applied a reasonable interpretation of the 2017 act along with the thenavailable guidance in finalizing our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 act any additional regulatory or interpretive guidance would constitute new information which may require further refinements to our estimates in future periods 

the following table sets forth income tax information from our consolidated statement of operations by dollar and effective tax rate 

the primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for 2022 and the us federal statutory rate of 21 are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction the deduction for foreign derived intangible income credits and tax holidays in malaysia the philippines and thailand that will expire at various dates during years 2024 through 2031 in addition the effective tax rate for 2022 includes a net increase to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which includes interest and offsetting tax benefits as a result of ongoing discussions with various taxing authorities of 352 million this amount includes 324 million related to the effects of the tentative settlement with the irs resolving the statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to 2008 through 2015 

the primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for 2021 and the us federal statutory rate of 21 are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction the deduction for foreign derived intangible income credits and tax holidays in malaysia philippines and thailand that will expire at various dates during 2021 through 2031 

our future effective tax rate is subject to future regulatory developments and changes in the mix of our us earnings compared to foreign earnings in particular beginning in 2023 the 2017 act requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses rather than expensing them in year incurred which is expected to both materially increase our effective tax rate and materially reduce our operating cash flows if not repealed or otherwise modified our total tax expense in future years may also vary as a result of discrete items such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies 

for additional information regarding income tax expense benefit see part ii item 8 note 14 income tax expense  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows 

we and the irs tentatively reached a settlement for resolving the statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2008 through 2015 we expect to pay tax and interest totaling approximat ely 600 million to 700 million  which we expect to be partially offset by future reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions aggregating to approximately 100 to 150 million see part i item 1 note 14 income tax expense for further details 

as further explained under key developments  financing activities above we have taken recent actions to reduce our overall debt levels and extend the average maturity following these actions we have reduced the outstanding principal amount of our debt by approximately 173 billion since july 2 2021 and over 80 of the principal amount is now due in 2026 or later we also have an existing shelf registration statement the “shelf registration statement” filed with the securities and exchange commission that expires in august 2024 which allows us to offer and sell shares of common stock preferred stock warrants and debt securities we used the shelf registration statement to complete our offering of 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in december 2021 and we may use the shelf registration statement or other capital sources including other offerings of equity or debt securities or the credit markets to satisfy future financing needs including planned or unanticipated capital expenditures investments debt repayments or other expenses any such additional financing will be subject to market conditions and may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

during 2023 we expect expenditures for property plant and equipment for our company plus our portion of the capital expenditures by our flash ventures joint venture with kioxia for its operations to aggregate to 32 billion after consideration of the flash ventures’ lease financing of its capital expenditures and net operating cash flow we expect net cash used for our purchases of property plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable relating to flash ventures to be a cash outflow of approximately 16 billion during 2023 the total expected cash to be used could vary depending on the timing and completion of various capital projects and the availability timing and terms of related financing 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt capital expenditure needs and other cash material cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

a total of 182 billion and 199 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the us as of july 1 2022 and july 2 2021 respectively there are no material tax consequences that were not previously accrued for on the repatriation of this cash 

operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus changes in operating assets and liabilities this represents our principal source of cash net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities was 108 billion for 2022 as compared to 175 million for 2021 changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements which are dependent on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle as well as timing of payments for taxes our cash conversion cycle measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales at the end of the respective fourth quarters the cash conversion cycles were as follows in days 



changes in days sales outstanding “dso” are generally due to the timing of shipments changes in days in inventory “dio” are generally related to the timing of inventory builds changes in days payables outstanding “dpo” are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

for 2022 dso increased by 14 days over the prior year reflecting timing of shipments as well as more favorable customer terms in the prior year partially offset by a decrease of approximately 6 days for higher factoring of receivables we have seen no significant deterioration in our receivables as a result of covid19 or other market conditions dio increased by 9 days over the prior fiscal year reflecting higher stocking levels of raw materials to minimize the risk of supply chain disruptions dpo increased 3 days over the prior year primarily reflecting routine variations in the timing of purchases and payments during the period 

investing activities 

n et cash used in investing activities in 2022 primarily consisted of 11 billion in capital expenditures and a 91 million net increase in notes receivable issuance to flash ventures net cash used by investing activities in 2021 primarily consisted of a 11 billion of capital expenditures partially offset by a 231 million net decrease in notes receivable issuances to flash ventures 

our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in us treasury securities and us government agency securities 

financing activities 

during 2022 net cash used in financing activities primarily related to our efforts to reduce our overall level of debt see “ key development  financing activities ” above for additional discussion net cash used in financing activities in 2021 primarily consisted of 886 million for repayment of debt which included 600 million in voluntary prepayments on our term loan b4 and 56 million for taxes paid on vested stock awards under employee stock plans partially offset by 134 million of cash from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans

purchase obligations and other commitments 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we also enter into longterm agreements with suppliers that contain fixed future commitments which are contingent on certain conditions such as performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

mandatory deemed repatriation tax 

the following is a summary of our estimated mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations under the 2017 act that are payable in the following fiscal years in millions 

for additional information regarding our estimate of the total tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax see part ii item 8 note 14 income tax expense  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended june 28 2019 

unrecognized tax benefits 

as of july 1 2022 the liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding accrued interest and penalties was approximately 105 billion accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of july 1 2022 was approximately 254 million of these amounts approximately 116 billion could result in potential cash payments with the exception of the tentative settlement we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax payments related to these obligations 

during 2022 we and the irs tentatively reached a settlement for resolving the statutory notices of deficiency and notices of proposed adjustments with respect to years 2008 through 2015 subject to the parties entering into final stipulations and a closing agreement as a result the trial originally scheduled to take place in may 2022 was cancelled the tentative settlement for resolution incrementally increased the liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and offsetting tax benefits by 324 million including this incremental increase we expect to pay tax and interest totaling approximately 600 million to 700 million which we expect to be partially offset by future reductions to our mandatory deemed repatriation tax obligations and tax savings from interest deductions aggregating to approximately 100 to 150 million while we continue to work with the irs to come to a final agreement on the federal tax and interest calculations we are uncertain as to when a final agreement will be reached and the exact timing of when any payments will be made however we believe it is reasonably likely that payments may be made within the next twelve months and have classified that portion of these unrecognized tax benefits including interest in income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet as of july 1 2022 this classification and amount may be subject to change in the next twelve months depending on when we are able to reach a final agreement with the irs 

mandatory research and development expense capitalization 

beginning in 2023 the 2017 act requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses rather than expensing them in the year incurred which is expected to result in materially higher cash tax payments if not repealed or otherwise modified 

interest rate risk 

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt as of july 1 2022 we had reduced the amount of variable rate debt to 270 billion from 543 billion as of july 2 2021 as of july 1 2022 a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 27 million we currently have payfixed interest rate swaps of 20 billion notional amount which would mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates through february 2023 

foreign exchange contracts 

we purchase foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments see part ii item 8 note 7 derivative instruments and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements products or services to be provided by us environmental compliance or from ip infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 500 billion of our common stock which authorization is effective through july 25 2023 for the year ended july 1 2022 we d id not make any stock repurchases and have not repurchased any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurch ase program since the first quarter of 2019 although we will reevaluate the repurchasing of our common stock when appropriate there can be no assurance if when or at what level we may resume such activity the remaining amount available to be repurchased under our current stock repurchase program as of july 1 2022 was 450 billion repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a rule 10b51 plan 

cash dividend 

we issued a quarterly cash dividend from the first quarter of 2013 up to the third quarter of 2020 in april 2020 we suspended our dividend to reinvest in the business and to support our ongoing deleveraging efforts we will reevaluate our dividend policy as our leverage ratio improves 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 note 2 recent accounting pronouncements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue 

we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions we also provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs the company records estimated variable consideration related to these items as a reduction to revenue at the time of revenue recognition we use judgment in our assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price we use the expected value method to arrive at the amount of variable consideration the company constrains variable consideration until the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable and believes that the expected value method is the appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration based on the fact that we have a large number of contracts with similar characteristics 

for sales to oems the company’s methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on the amount of consideration expected to be earned based on the oems’ volume of purchases from the company or other agreed upon sales incentive programs for sales to resellers the methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on several factors including historical pricing information current pricing trends and channel inventory levels estimating the impact of these factors requires significant judgment and differences between the estimated and actual amounts of variable consideration can be significant 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results while adjustments to these reserves have generally not been material in 2019 we recorded a charge to cost of sales of 110 million primarily to reduce component inventory to net realizable value as a result of a sudden change in demand for certain products 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized we account for interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

goodwill 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fourth quarter for each reporting unit we use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to perform a quantitative approach to determine the amount of impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including in the identification of our reporting units we also make judgments and assumptions in the assignment of assets and liabilities to our reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each of our reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and go odwill impairment for each reporting unit if our stock price decreases significantly goodwill could become impaired which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations our recent assessments have indicated that fair value exceeds carrying value by a reasonable margin and we have not identified any impairment indicators for our reporting units 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for product costs and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations substantially all of the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes for additional information see part ii item 8 note 6 fair value measurements and investments and note 7 derivative instruments and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

due to macroeconomic changes and volatility experienced in the foreign exchange market recently we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as a result of market movement therefore we have performed sensitivity analyses for 2022 and 2021 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts used to offset the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates used in performing the sensitivity analyses were based on market rates in effect at july 1 2022 and july 2 2021 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 306 million and 183 million at july 1 2022 and july 2 2021 respectively 

during 2022 2021 and 2020 total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

disclosure about interest rate risk 

variable interest rate risk 

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt as of july 1 2022 we had reduced the amount of variable rate debt to 270 billion from 543 billion as of july 2 2021 as of july 2 2022 our only variable rate debt outstanding was our term loan a2 loan which bears interest at the company’s option at a per annum rate equal to either x the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as defined in the loan agreement plus an applicable margin varying from 1125 to 2000 or y a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0125 to 1000 in each case depending on the corporate family ratings of the company from at least two of standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service inc and fitch ratings inc with an initial interest rate of adjusted term sofr plus 1375 

as of july 1 2022 a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 27 million we currently have payfixed interest rate swaps of 20 billion notional amount which would mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates noted above through february 2023 

for additional information regarding our variable interest rate debt see part ii item 8 note 8 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended july 1 2022 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights 

we have approximately 13700 active patents worldwide and have many patent applications in process we continually seek additional united states “us” and international patents on our technology we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products also depends upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for cannot alone ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented ip particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the laws of the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own ip portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills human resources and training to continue to be successful and to grow our manufacturing operations as necessary we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our production of hdd and flashbased products are highvolume and utilization lowcost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity we continually monitor our manufacturing capabilities to respond to the changing requirements of our customers and maintain our competitiveness and position as a data technology leader 

hdd and flashbased product manufacturing are complex processes involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and rigorous testing the manufacturing processes involve a number of steps that are dependent on each other and occur in “clean room” environments that demand skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of these manufacturing environments we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs we also leverage contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous 

our vertically integrated inhouse assembly and test operations for our hdd products are concentrated in prachinburi and bang pain thailand penang johor bahru and sarawak malaysia laguna philippines shenzhen china san jose and fremont ca usa 

ventures with kioxia 

substantially all of our flashbased supply requirements for our flashbased products is obtained from our ventures with kioxia which provide us with leadingedge highquality and lowcost flash memory wafers while substantially all of our flash memory supply utilized for our products is purchased from these ventures from timetotime we also purchase flash memory from other flash manufacturers while we do not unilaterally control the operations of our ventures with kioxia we believe that our business venture relationship with kioxia helps us reduce product costs increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers our business ventures with kioxia are located primarily in yokkaichi japan and our inhouse assembly and test operations located in shanghai china and penang malaysia 

we and kioxia currently operate three business ventures in 300millimeter flashbased manufacturing facilities in japan which provide us leadingedge costcompetitive flashbased memory wafers for our end products through flash partners ltd flash alliance ltd and flash forward ltd which we collectively refer to as flash ventures we and kioxia collaborate in the development and manufacture of flashbased memory wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the flash venture entities we hold a 499 ownership position in each of the flash venture entities each flash venture entity purchases wafers from kioxia at cost and then resells those wafers to us and kioxia at cost plus a small markup we are obligated to take our share of the output from these ventures or pay for variable costs incurred in producing our share of flash ventures’ flashbased memory wafer supply based on our threemonth forecast which generally equals 50 of flash ventures’ output in addition we are obligated to pay for half of flash ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase we are also obligated to fund 499 to 50 of each flash ventures entity’s capital investments to the extent that the flash ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments we codevelop flash technologies including process technology and memory design with kioxia and contribute ip for flash ventures’ use 

the agreements governing the operations of the flash venture entities also set out a framework for any investment by the joint venture partners in flash manufacturing capacity since its inception flash ventures’ primary manufacturing site has been located in yokkaichi japan the yokkaichi site which is owned and operated by kioxia currently includes five wafer fabrication facilities we have jointly invested and intend to continue to jointly invest with kioxia in manufacturing equipment for the yokkaichi fabrication facilities we also entered into additional agreements to extend flash ventures to a wafer fabrication facility known as “k1” located in kitakami japan k1 is operated by kioxia iwate corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of kioxia the primary purpose of k1 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flashbased wafer capacity to newer technology nodes in october 2020 kioxia announced the start of construction of the shell for a new fabrication facility in yokkaichi japan referred to as “y7” we expect to continue flash ventures investments into y7 in due course following the completion of agreements with kioxia governing the construction and operation of the new facility and according to prevailing market trends

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause material harm to our actual operating results and financial condition the risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but represent risks that we believe are material to us additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also negatively affect our business 

operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic could negatively affect our business 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our strategic partners customers suppliers and logistics providers these impacts have included and may continue to include underabsorbed overhead increased logistics and other costs decreased demand for our products and manufacturing challenges while our manufacturing facilities and those used by flash ventures are all currently operational this is subject to change based on evolving conditions related to the pandemic 

the effects of the pandemic are uncertain and difficult to predict but may include 

• further disruptions to our supply chain our operations or those of our strategic partners customers or suppliers caused by employees or others contracting covid19 or governmental orders to contain the spread of covid19 such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders trade controls and business shutdowns 

• a global economic downturn or a recession causing a decrease or shift in short or longterm demand for our products resulting in industry oversupply and decreases of average selling prices “asps” 

• deterioration of worldwide credit markets that may limit our ability or increase our cost to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to customer credit defaults 

• extreme volatility in financial markets which may harm our ability to access the financial markets on acceptable terms 

• increased data security and technology risk as many employees continue to work from home including possible outages to systems and technologies critical to remote work and increased data privacy risk with cybercriminals attempting to take advantage of the disruption and 

• reduced productivity or other disruptions of our operations if essential workers in our factories or those returning to our worksites are exposed to or spread covid19 to other employees 

the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business will depend on future developments beyond our control which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time including the severity and duration of the pandemic the extent of actions to contain or treat covid19 the timing distribution efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines around the world any possible resurgence of covid19 including the emergence of more contagious or vaccineresistant variants and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume 

adverse global or regional conditions could harm our business 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and many of our products and components are produced overseas as a result our business depends significantly on global and regional conditions adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions including but not limited to volatility in the financial markets tighter credit slower growth in certain geographic regions political uncertainty other macroeconomic factors changes to social conditions and regulations could significantly harm demand for our products increase credit and collectability risks result in revenue reductions reduce profitability as a result of underutilization of our assets cause us to change our business practices increase manufacturing and operating costs or result in impairment charges or other expenses 

our revenue growth is significantly dependent on the growth of international markets and we may face challenges in international sales markets we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of contract manufacturers including 

• obtaining governmental approvals and compliance with evolving foreign regulations 

• the need to comply with regulations on international business including the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 the antibribery laws of other countries and rules regarding conflict minerals 

• copyright levies or similar fees or taxes imposed in european and other countries 

• exchange currency and tax controls and reallocations 

• weaker protection of ip rights 

• trade restrictions such as export controls export bans import restrictions embargoes sanctions license and certification requirements including semiconductor encryption and other technology tariffs and complex customs regulations and 

• difficulties in managing international operations including appropriate internal controls 

as a result of these risks our business could be harmed 

we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical services materials or components and a disruption in our supply chain could negatively affect our business 

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware preamps controllers dynamic randomaccess memory components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing chip assembly product assembly and product testing and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our worldwide justintime hubs and distribution centers and to meet our freight needs many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we therefore depend on these suppliers to meet our business needs including dedicating adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products 

our suppliers have in the past been and may in the future be unable or unwilling to meet our requirements if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers or if we cannot purchase materials at a reasonable price we may not be able to meet demand for our products trade restrictions including tariffs quotas and embargoes demand from other high volume industries for materials or components used in our products disruptions in supplier relationships or shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in increased costs to us or decreased demand for our products which could negatively impact our business delays or cost increases experienced by our suppliers in developing or sourcing materials and components for use in our products or incompatibility or quality issues relating to our products could also harm our business 

we do not have longterm contracts with some of our existing suppliers nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers so we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our products any significant problems that occur at our suppliers could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems when we do have contractual commitments with suppliers in an effort to stabilize the supply of our components those commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components or make significant cash advances to the supplier and may not result in a satisfactory supply of our components 

in addition our supply base has experienced industry consolidation our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors decide to exit the industry or redirect their investments and increase costs to us in addition some of our suppliers have experienced a decline in financial performance where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation or a decline in financial performance is increased some of our suppliers may also be competitors in other areas of our business which could lead to difficulties in price negotiations or meeting our supply requirements 

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are subject to substantial risk of damage or disruption 

we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as a power outage terrorist attack physical security breach political instability civil unrest localized labor unrest or other employment issues or a health epidemic that negatively affects any of these facilities would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and source components and harm our business possible impacts include work and equipment stoppages and 

damage to or closure of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers for an indefinite period of time climate change has in the past and is expected to continue to increase the incidence and severity of certain natural disasters in addition the geographic concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from any of these problems 

we may incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the scope of the coverage of our insurance policies there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially due to market availability pricing or other reasons we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some cases no coverage at all for natural disasters and damage to our facilities as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost we depend upon kioxia to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash ventures if kioxia fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses and such failure could also cause flash ventures to breach various financing covenants 

the loss of our key management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace changes in our key management team can result in loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge departure of other key employees disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods global competition for skilled employees in the technology industry is intense and our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to implement succession plans for our key management and staff to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees including employees from acquisitions and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business including through equity compensation when our operating results are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees if we are unable to hire and retain key management staff or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems design defects or sustain system failures our business could be negatively impacted 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors service providers cloud solution providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks cyber attacks can include ransomware computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage in some instances efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent attacks may reduce the performance of our computer systems and networks which could negatively impact our business we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are increasingly organized and wellfinanced or supported by state actors and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities 

our products are also targets for cyber attacks including those products utilized in cloudbased environments as well as our cloud service offerings while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers further our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by 

requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects exposing us to litigation and indemnification claims and hurting our reputation 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result of actual or perceived breaches we could experience additional costs notification requirements civil and administrative fines and penalties indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated litigation or indemnification claims 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur including as a result of thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate in our products which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition product defects product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships lost revenue indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products warranty claims litigation or loss of market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provisions do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant they could harm our business 

business and strategic risks 

we rely substantially on strategic relationships with various partners including kioxia which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business 

we have entered into strategic relationships with various partners for product development sales growth and the supply of technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing including our business ventures with kioxia we depend on flash ventures for the development and manufacture of flashbased memory our strategic relationships including flash ventures are subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments our revenue and costs our future rate of spending our technology plans and our future growth opportunities 

substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by flash ventures which limits our ability to respond to market demand and supply changes and makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations a failure to accurately forecast supply and demand could cause us to overinvest or underinvest in technology transitions or the expansion of flash ventures’ capacity overinvestment by us or our competitors could result in excess supply which could cause significant decreases in our product prices significant excess obsolete inventory or inventory writedowns or underutilization charges and the potential impairment of our investments in flash ventures we are contractually obligated to pay for 50 of the fixed costs of flash ventures regardless of whether we order any flashbased memory and our orders placed with flash ventures on a threemonth rolling basis are binding on the other hand if we underinvest in flash ventures or otherwise grow or transition flash ventures’ capacity too slowly we may not have enough supply of flashbased memory or the right type of flashbased memory to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis and we may lose opportunities for revenue gross margin and market share as a result if our supply is limited we might make strategic decisions 

with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers which could result in less favorable gross margins or damage customer relationships 

our control over the operations of our business ventures may be limited and our interests could diverge from our strategic partners’ interests regarding ongoing and future activities for example under the flash ventures agreements we cannot unilaterally direct most of flash ventures’ activities and we have limited ability to source or fabricate flash outside of flash ventures flash ventures requires significant investments by both kioxia and us for technology transitions and capacity expansions and our business could be harmed if our technology roadmap and investment plans are not sufficiently aligned with kioxia’s lack of alignment with kioxia with respect to flash ventures could negatively impact our ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancement misalignment could arise due to changes in kioxia’s strategic priorities management ownership andor access to capital which has changed in recent years and could continue to change kioxia’s stakeholders may include or have included in the past competitors customers a private equity firm government entities andor public shareholders kioxia’s management changes ownership and capital structure could lead to delays in decisionmaking disputes or changes in strategic direction that could negatively impact the strategic partnership and therefore us there may exist conflicts of interest between kioxia’s stakeholders and flash ventures or us with respect to among other things protecting and growing flash ventures’ business ip and competitively sensitive confidential information 

together with kioxia we fund a portion of the investments required for flash ventures through lease financings availability of lease financings for flash ventures could also be limited by our andor kioxia’s financial performance to the extent that lease financings are not accessible on favorable terms or at all more cash would be required to fund investments 

our strategic relationships are subject to additional risks that could harm our business including but not limited to the following 

• failure by our strategic partners to comply with applicable laws 

• difficulties and delays in product and technology development at ramping production at and transferring technology to our strategic partners 

• failure by our strategic partners to timely fund capital investments with us or otherwise meet their commitments including paying amounts owed to us or third parties when due 

• we may lose the rights to technology or products being developed or manufactured by strategic partners including if any of them is acquired by another company files for bankruptcy or experiences financial or other losses 

• a bankruptcy event involving a strategic partner could result in structural changes to andor termination of the strategic partnership and 

• changes in tax or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes to the agreements governing our strategic partnerships 

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining asps volatile demand rapid technological change and industry consolidation as well as lengthy product qualifications all of which could negatively impact our business 

demand for our devices software and solutions which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period the prices of our products are influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand in the storage market including the effects of new fab capacity macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors the storage market has experienced volatile product life cycles which can harm our ability to recover the cost of product development and periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories significant reductions in asps and negative impacts on our revenue and gross margins 

further our asps and gross margins tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales to lower priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of revenue rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence finally the data storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years 

which could enhance the resources and lower the cost structure of some competitors these factors could result in a substantial decrease in our market share and harm our business 

as we compete in new product areas the overall complexity of our business may increase and may result in increases in rd expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability we must also qualify our products with customers through potentially lengthy testing processes with uncertain results some of our competitors offer products that we do not offer which may allow them to win sales from us and some of our customers may be developing storage solutions internally which may reduce their demand for our products we expect that competition will continue to be intense and our competitors may be able to gain a product offering or cost structure advantage over us which would harm our business further our competitors may utilize pricing strategies including offering products at prices at or below cost that we may be unable to competitively match we may also have difficulty effectively competing with manufacturers benefiting from governmental investments 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions and product development and introduction our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the markets for our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate to adapt our existing products or develop new products effectively if we fail to implement new technologies or develop new products desired by our customers quickly and costeffectively our business may be harmed 

in addition the success of our technology transitions and product development depends on a number of other factors including 

• rd expenses and results 

• difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp 

• market acceptancequalification 

• effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand 

• the vertical integration of some of our products which may result in more capital expenditures and greater fixed costs than if we were not vertically integrated 

• our ability to cost effectively respond to customer requests for new products or features and software associated with our products 

• our ability to increase our software development capability and 

• the effectiveness of our gotomarket capability in selling new products 

moving to new technologies and products may require us to align to and build a new supply base our success in new product areas may depend on our ability to enter into favorable supply agreements in addition if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting technologies to implement these new technologies are not available we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position 

additionally new products could substitute for our current products and make them obsolete we also develop products to meet certain industry and technical standards which may change and cause us to incur substantial costs as we adapt to new standards or invest in different manufacturing processes to remain competitive 

we experience sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate in addition accurately forecasting demand has become more difficult which could harm our business 

sales of many of our products tend to be seasonal and subject to supplydemand cycles changes in seasonal and cyclical supply and demand patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns for example we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of each quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of financial results for a given quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results 

the variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on accurately forecasting market and customer demand for our products accurately forecasting demand has also become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers due to volatility in global economic conditions end market dynamics and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our oem customers utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand we could experience periods of product oversupply excess inventory and price decreases which could impact our sales asps and gross margin thereby negatively affecting our operating results and our financial condition if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

failure to successfully execute on strategic initiatives including acquisitions divestitures or cost saving measures may negatively impact our future results 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and engage in cost saving measures acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all there may be difficulties with implementing new systems and processes or with integrating systems and processes of companies with complex operations which could result in inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and may increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective 

failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition or changes in technology development and related roadmaps following an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition acquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our shareholders as well as earnout or other contingent consideration payments and the issuance of additional indebtedness that would put additional pressure on liquidity furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could negatively affect our business in addition new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest with or in certain other countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so including investments in joint ventures minority investments and outbound technology transfers to certain countries 

cost saving measures restructurings and divestitures may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our manufacturing or other facilities as a result of these actions we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods these actions could also impact employee 

retention in addition we cannot be sure that these actions will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or consolidations or that we do not forego future business opportunities as a result of these actions 

loss of revenue from a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

historically nearly one half of our total revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance we have experienced and may in the future experience events such as the loss of a key customer prohibition or restriction of sales to a key customer by law regulation or other government action reductions in sales to or orders by a key customer customer requirements to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs or the acquisition of a key customer by one of our competitors these events would likely harm our operating results and financial condition further government authorities may implement laws or regulations or take other actions that could result in significant changes to the business or operating models of our customers such changes could negatively impact our operating results 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could negatively impact our profitability consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products increased customer pressure on our prices replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as cloud storage and computing platforms mobile social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could negatively impact our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

sales in the distribution channel and to the retail market are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes within these markets or maintain and grow our applicable market share our business could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product as a result of the shift to mobile devices more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our business could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel our operating results would be negatively impacted negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances 

a significant portion of our sales is also made through retailers our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple retail market channels particularly in the retail market negative publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors further changes to the retail environment such as store closures caused by macroeconomic conditions or changing customer preferences may reduce the demand for our products if customers no longer maintain a preference for our product brands or if our retailers are not successful in selling our products our operating results may be negatively impacted 

financial risks 

our substantial level of debt may negatively impact our liquidity restrict our operations and ability to respond to business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

we have a substantial amount of debt and may incur additional debt including under our revolving credit facility subject to customary conditions in our credit agreement our high level of debt could have significant consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes 

• imposing financial and other restrictive covenants on our operations including limiting our ability to i declare or pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock ii purchase assets make investments complete acquisitions consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person iii dispose of assets iv incur liens and v enter into transactions with affiliates and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures or take advantage of new opportunities to grow our business 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations comply with our debt covenants and deleverage depends on our cash flows and financial performance which are affected by financial business economic and other factors the rate at which we will be able to or choose to deleverage is uncertain failure to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness we may be unable to cure or obtain a waiver of an event of default or otherwise amend our debt agreements to prevent an event of default thereunder on terms acceptable to us or at all in that event the debt holders could accelerate the related debt which may result in the crossacceleration or crossdefault of other debt leases or other obligations we may not have sufficient funds available to repay accelerated indebtedness and we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities which we may be unable to do on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could harm our business further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs 

as our bank debt contains a variable interest rate component based on our corporate credit ratings a decline in our ratings could result in increased interest rates and debt service obligations in addition our ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies as to our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

our credit agreement uses the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a reference rate for our term loans and revolving credit facility such that the applicable interest rate may at our option be calculated based on libor in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor beginning at the end of 2021 and libor remains subject to ongoing national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform as a result libor may perform differently than in the past and may ultimately cease to be utilized or to exist either during or after 2021 alternative benchmark rates may replace libor and we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative benchmark rates or the effect of any changes to libor or the discontinuation of libor if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt which could negatively impact our interest expense results of operations and cash flows in addition replacing libor with an alternative reference rate for any of our debt could be a taxable event 

we also guarantee a significant amount of lease obligations of flash ventures owed to third parties flash ventures sells to and leases back a portion of its equipment from a consortium of financial institutions most of the lease obligations are guaranteed 50 by us and 50 by kioxia some of the lease obligations are guaranteed in full by us the leases are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors if a cancellation event 

were to occur flash ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us increased interest rates or waiver fees if a resolution is not reached we may be required to pay all of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 

we may from time to time seek to further refinance our substantial indebtedness by issuing additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into common stock or grant the holder the right to purchase common stock each of which may dilute our existing shareholders reduce the value of our common stock or both 

tax matters may materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

changes in tax laws in the united states the european union and around the globe have impacted and will continue to impact our effective worldwide tax rate which may materially affect our financial position and results of operations further organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities including cash movements could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business additionally portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met we may not be able to meet such conditions if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future 

our determination of our tax liability in the us and other jurisdictions is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as disclosed in part i item 1 note 14 income tax expense of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received statutory notices of deficiency seeking certain adjustments to income and have filed petitions with the us tax court although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in litigation or the payment of significant amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may harm our business 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue cost of revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin in addition our purchases of flashbased memory from flash ventures and our investment in flash ventures are denominated in japanese yen if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar our cost of purchasing flashbased memory wafers and the cost to us of future capital funding of flash ventures would increase when such events occur they have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the us therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the us fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could negatively impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the us 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place thus our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and may actually harm our operating results further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with 

financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions operating losses third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks our customers’ credit risk may also be exacerbated by an economic downturn or other adverse global or regional economic conditions any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use sharing and security of thirdparty data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security and privacy of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data and employee data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings laws and regulations relating to the collection use security and privacy of thirdparty data change over time and new laws and regulations become effective from time to time we are subject to notice and privacy policy requirements as well as obligations to respond to requests to know and access personal information correct personal information delete personal information and say no to the sale of personal information global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction we may also be subject to restrictions on crossborder data transfers and requirements for localized storage of data that could increase our compliance costs and risks and affect the ability of our global operations to coordinate activities and respond to customers compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

we are subject to state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health and safety regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the responsible business alliance “rba” and compliance with those requirements could cause an increase in our operating costs and failure to comply may harm our business 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health and safety practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers customers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products which could impair our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions or with certain customers and harm our operating results in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our suppliers customers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation certain customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which could harm our business 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the rba the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we or our suppliers customers or partners were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer 

we and certain of our officers are at times involved in litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which may be costly may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings fines or penalties which could materially harm our business 

from time to time we are involved in litigation including antitrust and commercial matters putative securities class action suits and other actions we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others some of the actions seek injunctive relief including injunctions against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business from time to time we may also be the subject of inquiries requests for information investigations and actions by government and regulatory agencies regarding our businesses any such matters could result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including fines penalties or restrictions on our business activities 

litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations in the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation investigation or governmental proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities including the manufacture use and sale of products with or without merit such matters can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by us could also result in counterclaims against us which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us in addition litigation investigations or governmental proceedings and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel affect demand for our products and harm the market prices of our securities 

we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation investigations or governmental proceedings these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits the cost of governmental law enforcement or regulatory investigations or proceedings civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measures if any which may be imposed 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other ip rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we have historically been involved in frequent disputes regarding patent and other ip rights and we have in the past received and we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other ip rights we may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license ip to others ip risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no ip protection as a defense against litigation the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of ip litigation increase the ip risks we face litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may be subject to injunctions enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may harm our business 

if we incorporate thirdparty technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the ip of others we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier customer or partner could negatively impact our business 

moreover from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged ip infringement the scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses including attorneys’ fees we may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business 

our reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable ip such as our process technology we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes there can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us it is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection there are entities whom we believe may infringe our ip enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our ip to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered ip rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

the success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands we believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products any occurrence of counterfeiting imitation or confusion with our brands could negatively affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands which in turn could negatively impact sales of our branded products our share and our gross margin as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution 

the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company or its directors officers or other employees 

our bylaws provide that unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company ii any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director officer or other employee of the company or its stockholders iii any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or the company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws or iv any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the “delaware exclusive forum provision” our bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the united states of america will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “federal forum provision” 

the delaware exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the exchange act or the securities act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction in addition the federal forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under the securities act and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the exchange act the exclusive forum provisions in the company’s bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and accordingly actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal courts our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations 

the exclusive forum provisions in the company’s bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the company or its directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits against the company and its directors officers and other employees in addition stockholders who do bring a claim in the court of chancery of the state of delaware pursuant to the delaware exclusive forum provision could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim particularly if they do not reside in or near delaware the court in the designated forum under our exclusive forum provisions may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the company than to our stockholders further the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that a court could find any of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings if a court were to find all or any part of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions

key developments 

business structure

covid19 pandemic and operational update 

as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states have from timetotime imposed measures intended to reduce its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business limitations and closures subject to exceptions for essential operations and businesses quarantines and shelterinplace orders although some of these governmental restrictions have since been lifted or scaled back a resurgence of covid19 infections could result in the reimposition of certain restrictions in efforts to reduce further spread of covid19 we have taken actions to protect the health and safety of our employees while continuing to serve our global customers as an essential business we have implemented and maintained more thorough sanitation practices as outlined by health organizations and supported vaccination efforts as we begin to phase in a return to site for more employees we are monitoring and adopting practices recommended by health organizations to ensure the continued safety of our employees and business partners in addition the responses to covid19 taken by others in the supply chain have increased the costs of their services which have in turn impacted our operations as a result we have incurred charges of approximately 127 million primarily related to higher logistics during the year ended july 2 2021 which were recorded in cost of revenue 

as an essential business we continue to provide products and solutions that enable the proliferation of data and facilitate the sharing of information remotely which has become more critical as much of the world is interacting from areas of selfisolation generally our revenues have remained solid during the pandemic supported by continued workfromhome distance learning and athome entertainment demand however the covid19 environment remains dynamic and we cannot predict the duration of the pandemic and how demand may change as it continues to develop 

we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities see “the covid19 pandemic could negatively affect our business” in part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding the risks we face as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

results of operations 

summary comparison of 2021 2020 and 2019 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and percentage of net revenue 1  

1 percentages may not total due to rounding 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding our revenue 



net revenue 

net revenue increased 1 in 2021 compared to 2020 which reflects approximately 13 percentage points increase in revenue related to higher exabyte volume of flash sold largely offset by lower average selling price per gigabyte 

client devices revenue increased 15 year over year reflecting a 22 increase from a higher volume of flash products sold this increase in flash volume was driven by continued strength in demand for notebook and chromebooks gaming smart home devices automotive and industrial applications this increase was partially offset by lower average selling price per gigabyte primarily in flash 

data center devices and solutions revenue decreased 20 year over year lower exabytes of storage sold for hdd and flash each contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the revenue decline while lower average selling price per gigabyte primarily in hdd products contributed another 6 percentage points to the decline yearoveryear volume was negatively impacted by cloud digestion and china shipment restrictions and delays in product qualifications with certain customers earlier in the year the impacts of cloud digestion have abated and we have now completed qualifications with all our cloud titan customers in flash we are beginning to see growth with our second generation nvme enterprise ssd at several cloud titans and are ramping production more broadly in hdd we are experiencing a resurgence of demand driven by the successful ramp of our 18terabyte energyassisted hard drive growing cloud demand a recovery in enterprise spending and to a lesser extent cryptocurrency driven by chia we believe the strong demand from our cloud customers and beginning of a recovery in the enterprise demand continues to positively impact results 

client solutions revenue increased 11 year over year which reflects an increase of approximately 16 percentage points due to exabyte growth split evenly between hdd and flash products which was partially offset by lower average selling price per gigabyte client solutions remains a high performing end market reflecting our brand recognition broad product portfolio and extensive distribution channels to markets 

the changes in net revenue by geography reflect an increase in asia due to our increased sales of mobility products to manufacturers in the asia region and a decrease in americas driven by lower sales of capacity enterprise products 

for 2021 2020 and 2019 our top 10 customers accounted for 39 42 and 45 respectively of our net revenue for each of 2021 2020 and 2019 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2021 2020 and 2019 these programs represented 19 16 and 15 respectively of gross revenues and adjustments to revenue due to changes in accruals for these programs have generally averaged less than 1 of gross revenue over the last three fiscal years the amounts attributed to our sales incentive and marketing programs generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions list pricing strategies seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue 

gross profit and gross margin 

gross profit increased 740 million or 196 in 2021 compared to 2020 which reflected a 279 million decrease in charges for amortization expense on acquired intangible assets 143 million improvement related to power outage charges of 68 million incurred in 2020 combined with a 75 million recovery in the current year as well as incremental profit from the increase in volume as a percent of revenue gross margin increased by 41 percentage points over the prior year of which 25 percentage points reflected the impact of the change in power outage charges and lower charges for amortization expense in addition as we ramped production on new products cost reduction also contributed to the increase in gross margin 

operating expenses 

research and development “rd” expense decreased 18 million in 2021 compared to 2020 the decrease was driven by lower facility costs of approximately 50 million due to restructuring and cost initiatives and approximately 20 million of lower travel related expenses due to covid19 restrictions partially offset by higher employee compensation cost for additional headcount as we invested in research and development and higher variable compensation cost due to improved earnings 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense decreased 48 million in 2021 compared to 2020 the decline was primarily driven by a 50 million reduction in expenses related to travel marketing and outside services as a result of covid19 restrictions 

the gains recognized in employee termination asset impairment and other charges compared to the losses in the prior year primarily reflect gains on the disposal of assets associated with our business realignment activities for additional information regarding employee termination asset impairment and other charges see part ii item 8 note 16 employee termination asset impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

interest and other income expense 

the decreases in total interest and other expense net in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflects a decrease in interest expense resulting from lower index rates and the paydown of principal on our debt during 2021 

income tax expense 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 act during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 however the us treasury and the internal revenue service “irs” have issued tax guidance on certain provisions of the 2017 act since the enactment date and we anticipate the issuance of additional regulatory and interpretive guidance we applied a reasonable interpretation of the 2017 act along with the thenavailable guidance in finalizing our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 act any additional regulatory or interpretive guidance would constitute new information which may require further refinements to our estimates in future periods 

the following table sets forth income tax information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollar and effective tax rate 

the primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for 2021 and the us federal statutory rate of 21 are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction the deduction for foreign derived intangible income credits and tax holidays in malaysia philippines and thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2021 through 2031 

the primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for 2020 and the us federal statutory rate of 21 are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction the deduction for foreign derived intangible income credits and tax holidays in malaysia philippines and thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2021 through 2030 in addition the effective tax rate for 2020 includes the discrete effect of a derecognition of 31 million for certain deferred tax assets associated with creditable foreign withholding taxes due to the issuance of final regulatory guidance the regulatory guidance does not preclude us from potentially claiming these creditable taxes as a period benefit when paid 

our future effective tax rate is subject to future regulatory developments and changes in the mix of our us earnings compared to foreign earnings our total tax expense in future fiscal years may also vary as a result of discrete items such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies 

for additional information regarding income tax expense benefit see part ii item 8 note 14 income tax expense  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

a discussion of our results of operations for 2019 including a comparison of such results of operations to 2020 is included in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended july 3 2020 filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 28 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows 

we believe our cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

during fiscal 2022 we expect expenditures for property plant and equipment for our company plus our portion of the capital expenditures by our flash ventures joint venture with kioxia for its operations to aggregate to 31 billion after consideration of the flash ventures’ lease financing of its capital expenditures and net operating cash flow we expect net cash used for our purchases of property plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable relating to flash ventures to be a cash outflow of approximately 20 billion during fiscal 2022 the total expected cash to be used could vary depending on the timing and completion of various capital projects and the availability timing and terms of related financing  

a total of 199 billion and 212 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the us as of july 2 2021 and july 3 2020 respectively there are no material tax consequences that were not previously accrued for on the repatriation of this cash 

operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus changes in operating assets and liabilities this represents our principal source of cash net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities was 175 million for 2021 as compared to 757 million for 2020 changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements which are dependent on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle as well as timing of payments for taxes our cash conversion cycle measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales at the end of the respective fourth quarters the cash conversion cycles were as follows 



changes in days sales outstanding “dso” are generally due to the linearity of timing of shipments changes in days in inventory “dio” are generally related to the timing of inventory builds changes in days payables outstanding “dpo” are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

for 2021 dso decreased by 8 days over the prior year reflecting more linearity in the timing of shipments and more favorable customer terms partially offset by an increase of approximately 2 days for lower factoring of receivables we have seen no significant deterioration in our receivables as a result of covid19 dio increased by 11 days over the prior year reflecting higher stocking levels of hdd inventory to serve anticipated demand growth and better output from flash ventures as production ramped up at the new fabrication sites dpo decreased by 4 days over the prior year primarily reflecting resumptions of flash production volumes and ramp up of production of new drives as well as routine variations in the timing of purchases and payments during the period 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2021 primarily consisted of 11 billion in capital expenditures partially offset by a 231 million net decrease in notes receivable issuances to flash ventures and proceeds of 143 million from the disposal of property plant and equipment primarily related to our business realignment activities net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of a 931 million net decrease in notes receivable issuances to flash ventures partially offset by 647 million of capital expenditures 

our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in us treasury securities and us government agency securities in addition from time to time we invest directly in us treasury securities us and international government agency securities certificates of deposit asset backed securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds 

financing activities 

during 2021 net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of 886 million for repayment of debt which included 600 million in voluntary prepayments on our term loan b4 and 56 million for taxes paid on vested stock awards under employee stock plans partially offset by 134 million of cash from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans net cash used in financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of 982 million for the repayment of debt which included 725 million in voluntary prepayments on our term loan b4 595 million to pay dividends on our common stock and 72 million for taxes paid with respect to vested stock awards under our employee stock plans partially offset by 141 million of cash from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans on july 19 2021 we made an incremental voluntary prepayment of 150 million on our term loan b4

interest rate swap 

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt at july 2 2021 we had 543 billion of variable rate debt comprising 61 of the par value of our debt to balance the portfolio and moderate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates underlying our variable debt we entered into payfixed interest rate swaps on 200 billion notional amount which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through february 2023 after giving effect to the 200 billion of interest rate swaps we effectively had 343 billion of longterm debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 34 million 

foreign exchange contracts

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

stock repurchase program

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 note 2 recent accounting pronouncements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue 

we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions we also provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs the company records estimated variable consideration related to these items as a reduction to revenue at the time of revenue recognition we use judgment in our assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price we use the expected value method to arrive at the amount of variable consideration the company constrains variable consideration until the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable and believes that the expected value method is the appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration based on the fact that we have a large number of contracts with similar characteristics 

for sales to oems the company’s methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on the amount of consideration expected to be earned based on the oems’ volume of purchases from the company or other agreed upon sales incentive programs for sales to resellers the methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on several factors including historical pricing information current pricing trends and channel inventory levels differences between the estimated and actual amounts of variable consideration are recognized as adjustments to revenue 

marketing development program costs are typically recorded as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore of revenue we net sales rebates against open customer receivable balances if the criteria to offset are met otherwise they are recorded within other accrued liabilities 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized we account for interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to perform a quantitative approach to determine the amount of impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of one or more reporting units if we had more than one reporting unit judgment would also be required in the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit if our stock price decreases significantly goodwill could become impaired which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations 

other longlived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets the estimates of fair value require evaluation of future market conditions and product lifecycles as well as projected revenue earnings and cash flow 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for product costs and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations substantially all of the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes for additional information see part ii item 8 note 5 fair value measurements and investments and note 6 derivative instruments and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

due to macroeconomic changes and volatility experienced in the foreign exchange market recently we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as a result of market movement therefore we have performed sensitivity analyses for 2021 and 2020 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts used to offset the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates used in performing the sensitivity analyses were based on market rates in effect at july 2 2021 and july 3 2020 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 183 million and 135 million at july 2 2021 and july 3 2020 respectively 

during 2021 2020 and 2019 total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

disclosure about interest rate risk 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan a1 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor subject to a 00 floor plus an applicable margin varying from 1125 to 2000 or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0125 to 1000 in each case depending on our corporate credit ratings as of july 2 2021 the applicable margin based on our current credit ratings was 15 borrowings under our term loan b4 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor subject to a 00 floor plus a margin of 175 or a base rate plus a margin of 075 

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt as of july 2 2021 we had 543 billion of variable rate debt representing 61 of the par value of our debt to balance the portfolio and moderate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates underlying our variable debt we entered into payfixed interest rate swaps on 200 billion notional amount which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through february 2023 after giving effect to the 200 billion of interest rate swaps we effectively had 343 billion of longterm debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 34 million 

for additional information regarding our variable interest rate debt see part ii item 8 note 7 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a‑15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a‑15f and 15d‑15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013 based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see report of independent registered public accounting firm herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended july 2 2021 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we substantially completed the initial implementation of our enterprise resource planning system on a worldwide basis these system changes resulted in the modification of certain processes and controls but no changes materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting going forward we expect to make routine enhancements and modifications in the normal course of business in addition as noted previously we are implementing new reporting modules and processes to provide more discrete information to support our new organizational structure as we implement these enhancements and modifications in future periods we will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights 

we have approximately 13500 active patents worldwide and have many patent applications in process we continually seek additional united states “us” and international patents on our technology we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products also depends upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for cannot alone ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented ip particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the laws of the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own ip portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills human resources and training to continue to be successful and to grow our manufacturing operations as necessary we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our production of hdd and flashbased products are highvolume and utilization lowcost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity we continually monitor our manufacturing capabilities to respond to the changing requirements of our customers and maintain our competitiveness and position as a data technology leader 

hdd and flashbased product manufacturing are complex processes involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and rigorous testing the manufacturing processes involve a number of steps that are dependent on each other and occur in “clean room” environments that demand skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of these manufacturing environments we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

substantially all of our flashbased supply requirements for our flashbased products is obtained from our business ventures with kioxia which provide us with leadingedge highquality and lowcost flash memory wafers this represents our captive supply and we are obligated to take our share of the output from these ventures or pay the fixed costs associated with that capacity see “ventures with kioxia” below for additional information while substantially all of our flash memory supply utilized for our products is purchased from these ventures from timetotime we also purchase flash memory from other flash manufacturers which we refer to as noncaptive while we do not unilaterally control the operations of our ventures with kioxia we believe that our business venture relationship with kioxia helps us to reduce the costs of producing our products increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers our vertically integrated manufacturing operations for our flashbased products are concentrated in three locations with our business ventures with kioxia located primarily in yokkaichi japan and our inhouse assembly and test operations located in shanghai china and penang malaysia 

we also leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k 

materials and supplies 

hdd consists primarily of recording heads magnetic media and a printed circuit board assembly we design and manufacture substantially all of the recording heads and magnetic media required for our products as a result we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less reliant on recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers we depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our hdd product design manufacturing and testing 

our flashbased products consist of flash memory controllers and firmwares substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by our business ventures with kioxia controllers are primarily designed inhouse and manufactured by thirdparty foundries or acquired from thirdparty suppliers we believe the use of our inhouse assembly and test facilities as well as contract manufacturers provides flexibility and gives us access to increased production capacity we have developed deep relationships with these vendors and kioxia to establish continuous supply of flashbased memory and controllers 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for our component requirements but for business or technology reasons we source some of our components from a limited number of sole or single source providers currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k 

ventures with kioxia 

we and kioxia currently operate three business ventures in 300millimeter flashbased manufacturing facilities in japan which provide us leadingedge costcompetitive flashbased memory wafers for our end products through flash partners ltd flash alliance ltd and flash forward ltd which we collectively refer to as flash ventures we and kioxia collaborate in the development and manufacture of flashbased memory wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the flash venture entities we hold a 499 ownership position in each of the flash venture entities each flash venture entity purchases wafers from kioxia at cost and then resells those wafers to us and kioxia at cost plus a small markup we are obligated to pay for variable costs incurred in producing our share of flash ventures’ flashbased memory wafer supply based on our threemonth forecast which generally equals 50 of flash ventures’ output in addition we are obligated to pay for half of flash ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase we are also obligated to fund 499 to 50 of each flash ventures entity’s capital investments to the extent that flash ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments we codevelop flash technologies including process technology and memory design with kioxia and contribute ip for flash ventures’ use 

the agreements governing the operations of the flash venture entities also set out a framework for any investment by the joint venture partners in flash manufacturing capacity since its inception flash ventures’ primary manufacturing site has been located in yokkaichi japan the yokkaichi site which is owned and operated by kioxia currently includes five wafer fabrication facilities we have jointly invested and intend to continue to jointly invest with kioxia in manufacturing equipment for the yokkaichi fabrication facilities in may 2019 we entered into additional agreements to extend flash ventures to a new wafer fabrication facility known as “k1” located in kitakami japan k1 is operated by kioxia iwate corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of kioxia the primary purpose of k1 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flashbased wafer capacity to newer technology nodes output from the initial production line at k1 began in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 meaningful output from k1 is not expected to begin until the end of calendar year 2020

original equipment manufacturers oems purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer and assemble them into the devices they build and market under their own brands oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations in addition we sell flash storage solutions directly to customers that offer our products under their own brand name in the retail market which we also classify as oems 

cloud a large and growing customer base are those who integrate our storage solutions to provide services to other companies and end users primarily through the cloud this customer base includes hyperscale users that utilize our storage solutions to provide cloudbased services and infrastructure including information technology services social media gaming streaming media research and other services to an everincreasing market this group of customers purchase either directly through an integrator an original design manufacturer “odm” an oem or a combination of channels 

distributors we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and consumer electronics “ce” manufacturers dealers valueadded resellers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our websites 

for each of 2020 2019 and 2018 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding revenue recognition and major customers see part ii item 8 note 1 organization and basis of presentation and note 10 business segment revenue information geographic information and concentration of risk  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of sale depending on the type of product with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten years or more our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for additional information regarding our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1 organization and basis of presentation and note 3 supplemental financial statement data of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action

employees 

as of july 3 2020 we employed a total of approximately 63800 employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer our employees compensation and benefit programs that we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement nearly half of our employees in japan and china and a portion of our employees in malaysia are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors 

our business financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties whether currently known or unknown any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or from anticipated future results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but represent risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our common stock 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our strategic partners customers suppliers and logistics providers these impacts have included and may continue to include underabsorbed overhead increased logistics and other costs decreased demand for our products and manufacturing challenges including decreased product output while our manufacturing facilities and those used by flash ventures are all currently operational in some cases with exemptions from government restrictions this is subject to change based on evolving conditions related to the pandemic 

the effects of the pandemic are uncertain and difficult to predict but may include 

• further disruptions to our supply chain our operations or those of our strategic partners customers or suppliers caused by employees or others contracting covid19 or governmental orders to contain the spread of covid19 such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders trade controls and business shutdowns 

• a deepening of the global economic downturn or a recession causing a decrease or shift in short or longterm demand for our products resulting in industry oversupply and decreases of average selling prices “asps” which would adversely impact our profitability 

• further deterioration of worldwide credit markets that may limit our ability or increase our cost to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to customer credit defaults 

• extreme volatility in financial markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access the financial markets on acceptable terms 

• increased data security and technology risk as many employees continue to work from home including possible outages to systems and technologies critical to remote work and increased data privacy risk with cybercriminals attempting to take advantage of the disruption 

• reduced productivity or other disruptions of our operations if essential workers in our factories or those returning to our worksites are exposed to or spread covid19 to other employees and 

• management’s ongoing commitment of significant time attention and resources to respond to the pandemic 

the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time including the severity and duration of the pandemic the extent of actions to contain or treat covid19 the effectiveness of government stimulus programs any possible resurgence of covid19 that may occur after the current outbreak subsides how quickly and to what 

extent normal economic and operating activity can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in more detail in this “risk factors” section such as those relating to adverse global or regional conditions our highly competitive industry supply chain disruption demand conditions and our ability to forecast demand cost saving initiatives our indebtedness and liquidity and cyber attacks 

adverse global or regional conditions could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and many of our products and components are produced overseas as a result our business results of operations and financial condition depend significantly on global and regional conditions adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions including but not limited to volatility in the financial markets tighter credit slower growth in certain geographic regions political uncertainty other macroeconomic factors and changes to social conditions policies rules and regulations could significantly harm demand for our products increase credit and collectability risks result in revenue reductions cause us to change our business practices increase manufacturing and operating costs or result in impairment charges or other expenses 

our revenue and future growth are significantly dependent on the growth of international markets and we may face difficulties in entering or maintaining international sales markets we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing and sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of and reliance on contract manufacturers including 

• obtaining requisite governmental permits and approvals compliance with foreign laws and regulations and changes in foreign laws and regulations 

• the need to comply with regulations on international business including the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 the antibribery laws of other countries and rules regarding conflict minerals 

• copyright levies or similar fees or taxes imposed in european and other countries 

• exchange currency and tax controls and reallocations 

• weaker protection of ip rights 

• trade restrictions such as export controls export bans embargoes sanctions license and certification requirements including semiconductor encryption and other technology new or increased tariffs and fees and complex customs regulations and 

• difficulties in managing international operations including appropriate internal controls 

as a result of these risks our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely substantially on our business ventures with kioxia for the development and supply of flashbased memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our ventures with kioxia to develop and manufacture our flashbased memory we partner with kioxia on the development of flashbased technology including future generations of 3d nand as well as other nonvolatile memory technology in support of flash ventures flash ventures is subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments our revenue and costs our future rate of spending our technology plans and our future growth opportunities 

substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by flash ventures which limits our ability to respond to market demand and supply changes a failure to accurately forecast demand could cause us to overinvest or underinvest in technology transitions or the expansion of flash ventures’ capacity overinvestment by us or our competitors could result in excess supply which could cause significant decreases in our product prices significant excess obsolete inventory or inventory writedowns or underutilization charges and the potential impairment of our investments in flash ventures on the other hand if we underinvest in flash ventures or otherwise grow or transition flash ventures’ capacity more slowly than we expect or than the rest of the industry we may not have enough supply of the right type of memory or at all to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis and we may lose opportunities for revenue gross margin and market share as a result if our supply is limited we may make strategic decisions with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers and these strategic allocation decisions may result in less favorable gross margin or damage certain customer relationships we are contractually obligated to pay for 50 of the fixed costs of flash ventures regardless of whether we purchase any wafers from flash ventures furthermore purchase orders placed with flash ventures and under the foundry arrangements with kioxia for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled therefore once our purchase decisions have been made our production costs for flash memory are fixed and we may be unable to reduce costs to match any subsequent declines in pricing or demand which would harm our gross margin our limited ability to react to fluctuations in flash memory supply and demand makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations 

under the flash ventures agreements we have limited power to unilaterally direct most of the activities that most significantly impact flash ventures’ performance and we have limited ability to source or fabricate flashbased memory outside of flash ventures lack of alignment with kioxia with respect to flash ventures could adversely impact our ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancement and our investment in flash ventures and otherwise harm our business misalignment could arise due to changes in kioxia’s strategic priorities management ownership andor access to capital which has changed significantly recently and could continue to change kioxia’s stakeholders may include or have included in the past flash and hdd competitors customers a private equity firm and a bank owned by the government of japan or public shareholders if kioxia publicly lists its shares in the future kioxia’s management changes ownership and capital structure could lead to delays in decisionmaking disputes or changes in strategic direction that could adversely impact flash ventures andor adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition there may exist conflicts of interest between kioxia’s stakeholders and flash ventures or us with respect to among other things protecting and growing flash ventures’ business ip and competitively sensitive confidential information 

flash ventures requires significant investments by both kioxia and us for technology transitions including the transition to 3d nand and capacity expansions in may 2019 kioxia’s parent company kioxia holdings corporation “khc” announced new financing in the amount of 12 trillion japanese yen khc’s financing agreements andor its high level of debt could limit kioxia’s ability to timely fund or finance investments in flash ventures or our joint development efforts as well as limit flash ventures’ ability to enter into lease financings availability of lease financings for flash ventures could also be limited by our andor kioxia’s financial performance to the extent that lease financings for flash ventures are not accessible on favorable terms or at all more cash would be required to fund investments if kioxia does not or we do not provide sufficient resources or have adequate access to credit to timely fund investments in flash ventures our investments could be delayed or reduced delayed or reduced investment in manufacturing capacity or rd could harm flash ventures’ competitiveness andor our investment in flash ventures in addition khc’s financing arrangements might be secured by kioxia’s equity interests in flash ventures permitting the lenders to foreclose on those equity interests under certain circumstances 

in may 2019 we entered into definitive agreements with kioxia regarding a new 3d nand wafer fabrication facility in kitakami iwate japan known as “k1” output from flash ventures’ initial production line at k1 began in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 as k1 is located at a new manufacturing site k1 could be particularly susceptible to delays and other challenges in the production ramp and yields qualification of wafers shipment of samples to customers and customer approval processes further although we intend to continue to jointly invest with kioxia to ramp up manufacturing capacity at k1 there is no certainty as to when and on what terms we will do so if and for so long as our share of the k1 capacity falls below a specified threshold we will be responsible for bearing fixed costs associated with k1’s operations at that threshold which could adversely affect our financial results 

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining average selling prices “asps” volatile demand rapid technological change and industry consolidation all of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

demand for our devices software and solutions that we offer to our customers which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems including personal computers and mobile devices manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period the prices of our products are influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand in the storage market including the effects of new fab capacity macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors the storage market has experienced volatile product life cycles which can adversely affect our ability to recover the cost of product development and periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories significant reductions in asps and adverse impacts on our revenue and gross margins 

further our asps and gross margins tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of revenue rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence finally the data storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years further consolidation across the industry could enhance the capacity abilities and resources and lower the cost structure of some of our competitors causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage these factors may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share all of which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we compete based on our ability to offer our customers competitive solutions that provide the most current and desired products and service features as we compete in new product areas the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and may result in increases in rd expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability we must also qualify our products with customers through potentially lengthy testing processes which may result in delayed reduced or lost product sales some of our competitors offer products and technologies that we do not offer and may be able to use their broader product and technology portfolio to win sales from us and some of our customers may be developing storage solutions internally which may reduce their demand for our products we expect that competition will continue to be intense and there is a risk that our competitors may be able to gain a product offering or cost structure advantage over us which may result in a loss of business to us further some of our competitors may utilize certain pricing strategies including offering products at prices at or below cost that we may be unable to competitively match we may also have difficulty effectively competing with manufacturers benefitting from governmental investments 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions and product development and introduction our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate and adapt our existing products or develop new products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement new technologies successfully if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies or if our technology transitions or product development are more costly to complete than anticipated we may not be able to offer products our customers desire and our costs may not remain competitive which would harm revenues our gross margin and operating results 

in addition the success of our technology transitions and product development and introduction depends on a number of other factors including 

• rd expenses and results 

• difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp 

• market acceptancequalification 

• effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand 

• the vertical integration of some of our products which may result in more capital expenditures and greater fixed costs than if we were not vertically integrated 

• our ability to cost effectively respond to customer requests for new products or features and software associated with our products 

• our ability to increase our software development capability and 

• the effectiveness of our gotomarket capability in selling new products 

moving to new technologies and products may require us to align to and build a new supply base our success in new product areas may be dependent in part on our ability to develop close relationships with new suppliers and on our ability to enter into favorable supply agreements where this cannot be done our business and operations may be adversely affected in addition if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting technologies to implement these new technologies are not available we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position 

additionally new technologies and products could substitute for or replace our current technologies and products and make them obsolete we also develop products to meet certain industry and technical standards which may change we could incur substantial costs as a result of shifts in technology and standards such as adopting new standards or investing in different capital equipment or manufacturing processes to remain competitive 

for additional technology transition risks related to flash ventures see the risk factor entitled “ we rely substantially on our business ventures with kioxia for the development and supply of flashbased memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results ” 

our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have entered into strategic relationships with various partners for future product development sales growth and the supply of technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing including our partnership with kioxia for flashbased memory development and manufacturing these strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations and financial condition these risks include but are not limited to the following 

• our interests could diverge from our partners’ interests or we may not agree with coventurers on ongoing activities technology transitions or on the amount timing or nature of further investments in the relationship 

• we may experience difficulties and delays in product and technology development at ramping production at and transferring technology to our business ventures 

• our control over the operations of our business ventures is limited 

• due to financial constraints our coventurers may be unable to meet their commitments to us or may pose credit risks for our transactions with them 

• due to differing business models financial constraints or longterm business goals our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment by our business ventures which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us or prevent us from proceeding in the investment 

• we may lose the rights to technology or products being developed by the strategic relationship including if any of our coventurers is acquired by another company or otherwise transfers its interest in the business venture files for bankruptcy or experiences financial or other losses 

• a bankruptcy event involving a coventurer could result in the early termination or adverse modification of the business venture or agreements governing the business venture 

• we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our coventurers 

• the terms of our arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable and 

• changes in tax legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our coventurers 

if our strategic relationships are unsuccessful or there are unanticipated changes in or termination of our strategic relationships our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical materials or components and a disruption in our supply chain including a shortage in supply or a supplier’s failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us or supplier consolidation could adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results  

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware preamps controllers dynamic randomaccess memory components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing chip assembly product assembly and product testing and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our justintime hubs distribution centers and freight from suppliers to our factories and from our factories to our customers throughout the world many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to meet our business needs including dedicating adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products technology and equipment 

our suppliers have in the past been and may in the future be unable or unwilling to meet our requirements if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers or if we cannot purchase materials at a reasonable price we may not be able to meet demand for our products trade restrictions including tariffs quotas and embargoes demand from other high volume industries for materials or components used in our products disruptions in supplier relationships or shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in increased costs to us or decreased demand for our products which could negatively impact our operating results delays or cost increases experienced by our suppliers in developing or sourcing materials and components for use in our products or incompatibility or quality issues relating to our products could also harm our financial results as well as business relationships with our customers 

we do not have longterm contracts with some of our existing suppliers nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers and therefore we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our products any significant problems that occur at our suppliers or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems either of which would harm our operating results and financial condition when we do have contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components those commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components and may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory which could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our operating results 

in addition our supply base has experienced industry consolidation our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors consolidate decide to exit the industry or redirect their investments and increase costs to us each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition some of our suppliers have experienced a decline in financial performance where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation or a decline in financial performance is enhanced some of our suppliers may also be competitors in other areas of our business which could lead to difficulties in price negotiations or meeting our supply requirements any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results 

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are subject to substantial risk of damage or disruption 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as a power outage terrorist attack political instability civil unrest localized labor unrest or other employment issues or a health epidemic that adversely affects any of these facilities the employees the technology infrastructure or logistics operators at these facilities would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and source components which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results in addition the geographic concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from any of these problems a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

we may incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the scope of the coverage of our insurance policies there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially due to market availability pricing or other reasons we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some cases no coverage at all for natural disasters and environmental damages as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost we depend upon kioxia to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash ventures if kioxia fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses and such failure could also cause flash ventures to breach various financing covenants 

we experience sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate in addition accurately forecasting demand has become more difficult which could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

sales of computer systems mobile devices storage subsystems gaming consoles and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and subject to supplydemand cycles and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in supply dynamics and customer demand changes in seasonal and cyclical supply and demand patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions actions by competitors new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

the variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on accurately forecasting market and customer demand for our products accurately forecasting demand has also become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers due to volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our original equipment manufacturers “oem” customers utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand we could experience periods of product oversupply excess inventory and price decreases which could impact our sales asps and gross margin thereby adversely affecting our operating results and our financial condition if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

the loss of our key management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace changes in our key management team can result in loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge departure of other key employees disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods global competition for skilled employees in the technology related industry is intense and our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to implement succession plans for our key management and staff to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees including employees from acquisitions and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business including through equity compensation when our operating results are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees versus other companies that may pay a relatively higher portion of base compensation if we are unable to hire and retain key management staff or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions which are a key part of our growth strategy it may adversely affect our future results 

we seek to be an industryleading developer manufacturer and provider of innovative storage solutions balancing our core hard drive and flash memory business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all there may be difficulties with implementing new systems and processes or with integrating systems and processes of companies with complex operations which could result in inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and may increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition or changes in technology development and related roadmaps following an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition acquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our shareholders and the issuance of additional indebtedness that would put additional pressure on liquidity furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest with or in certain other countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so including investments in joint ventures minority investments and outbound technology transfers to certain countries 

any cost saving initiatives restructurings or divestitures that we undertake may result in disruptions to our operations and may not deliver the results we expect which may adversely affect our business 

from time to time we engage in cost saving initiatives restructurings and divestitures that may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our manufacturing or other facilities as a result of these actions we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods these actions could also impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that these actions will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or consolidations or that we do not forego future business opportunities as a result of these actions if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our operating results could be adversely affected 

our high level of debt may adversely impact our liquidity restrict our operations and ability to respond to business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

as of july 3 2020 our total indebtedness was 971 billion in aggregate principal and we had 225 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility subject to customary conditions under the credit agreement 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes 

• imposing financial and other restrictive covenants on our operations including limiting our ability to i declare or pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock ii purchase assets make investments complete acquisitions consolidate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person iii dispose of assets iv incur liens and v enter into transactions with affiliates and 

• making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures or take advantage of new opportunities to grow our business 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations comply with our debt covenants and deleverage depends on our cash flows and financial performance which are affected by financial business economic and other factors the rate at which we will be able to or choose to deleverage is uncertain failure to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness we may be unable to cure or obtain a waiver of an event of default or otherwise amend our debt agreements to prevent an event of default thereunder on terms acceptable to us or at all in that event the debt holders could accelerate the related debt which may result in the crossacceleration or crossdefault of other debt leases or other obligations we may not have sufficient funds available to repay accelerated indebtedness and we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities which we may be unable to do on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs 

as our bank debt contains a variable interest rate component based on our corporate credit ratings a decline in our ratings could result in increased interest rates and debt service obligations in addition our ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies as to our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

our credit agreement uses the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a reference rate for our term loans and revolving credit facility such that the applicable interest rate may at our option be calculated based on libor in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in april 2018 the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing a secured overnight funding rate which is intended to replace us dollar libor plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced at this time we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to libor or the discontinuation of libor if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt which could adversely impact our interest expense results of operations and cash flows in addition replacing libor with an alternative reference rate for any of our debt could be a taxable event 

we may from time to time seek to further refinance our substantial indebtedness by issuing additional shares of common stock which may dilute our existing shareholders reduce the value of our common stock or both 

loss of revenue from a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the year ended july 3 2020 42 of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance we have experienced and may in the future experience events such as the loss of a key customer prohibition or restriction of sales to a key customer by law regulation or other government action reductions in sales to or orders by a key customer customer requirements to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs or the acquisition of a key customer by one of our competitors these events would likely harm our operating results and financial condition further government authorities may implement laws or regulations or take other actions that could result in significant changes to the business or operating models of our customers such changes could adversely affect our operating results 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products increased customer pressure on our prices replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as cloud storage and computing platforms mobile social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

tax matters may materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

changes in tax laws in the united states the european union and around the globe have impacted and will continue to impact our effective worldwide tax rate which may materially affect our financial position and results of operations further organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations additionally portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met we may not be able to meet such conditions if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future 

our determination of our tax liability in the us and other jurisdictions is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 13 income tax expense of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received statutory notices of deficiency seeking certain adjustments to income and have filed petitions with the us tax court although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in litigation or the payment of significant amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

sales in the distribution channel and to the retail market are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes within these markets or maintain and grow our applicable market share our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product as a result of the shift to mobile devices more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel our operating results would be adversely affected negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances 

a significant portion of our sales is also made through retailers our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple retail market channels particularly in the retail market adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors further changes to the retail environment such as store closures caused by macroeconomic conditions or changing customer preferences may reduce the demand for our products if customers no longer maintain a preference for our product brands or if our retailers are not successful in selling our products our operating results may be adversely affected 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

• weakness in demand for one or more product categories 

• the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major customers or loss of major customers 

• our product mix 

• reductions in the asps of our products and lower margins 

• excess output capacity or inventory resulting in lower asps financial charges or impairments or insufficient output capacity or inventory resulting in lost revenue opportunities 

• inability to successfully implement technology transitions or other technology developments or other failure to reduce product costs to keep pace with reduction in asps 

• manufacturing delays or interruptions 

• delays in design wins or customer qualifications acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our products 

• variations in the cost of and lead times for components for our products disruptions of our supply chain 

• increase in costs due to warranty claims and 

• higher costs as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems design defects or sustain system failures our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors service providers cloud solution providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks cyber attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage in some instances efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent attacks may reduce the performance of our computer systems and networks which could negatively impact our business we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities 

our products are also targets for cyber attacks including those products utilized in cloudbased environments as well as our cloud service offerings while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers further our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects exposing us to litigation and indemnification claims and hurting our reputation 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result we could experience additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use sharing and security of thirdparty data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm  

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security and privacy of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data and employee data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings laws and regulations relating to the collection use and security and privacy of thirdparty data change over time and new laws and regulations become effective from time to time for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective january 1 2020 imposes new obligations on certain companies doing business in california with respect to the personal information of california residents these obligations include new notice and privacy policy requirements as well as new obligations to respond to requests to know and access personal information delete personal information and say no to the sale of personal information global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated litigation or indemnification claims 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur including as a result of thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate in our products which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition product defects product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships lost revenue indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products warranty claims litigation or loss of market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provisions do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the responsible business alliance “rba” and compliance with those requirements could cause an increase in our operating costs and failure to comply may harm our business 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers customers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products which could impair our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions or with certain customers and harm our operating results in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our suppliers customers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation certain customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the rba the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we or our suppliers customers or partners were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer 

we and certain of our officers are at times involved in litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which may be costly may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings fines or penalties which could materially harm our business 

from time to time we are involved in litigation including antitrust and commercial matters putative securities class action suits and other actions we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others some of the actions seek injunctive relief including injunctions against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results from time to time we may also be the subject of inquiries requests for information investigations and actions by government and regulatory agencies regarding our businesses any such matters could result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including fines penalties or restrictions on our business activities 

litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations in the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation investigation or governmental proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities including the manufacture use and sale of products with or without merit such matters can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by us could also result in counterclaims against us which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us in addition litigation investigations or governmental proceedings and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel affect demand for our products and harm the market prices of our securities 

we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation investigations or governmental proceedings these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits the cost of governmental law enforcement or regulatory investigations or proceedings civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measures if any which may be imposed 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other ip rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we have historically been involved in frequent disputes regarding patent and other ip rights and we have in the past received and we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other ip rights we may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license ip to others ip risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no ip protection as a defense against litigation the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of ip litigation increase the ip risks we face litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may be subject to injunctions enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

if we incorporate thirdparty technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the ip of others we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier customer or partner could negatively impact our business 

moreover from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged ip infringement the scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses including attorneys’ fees we may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

our reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable ip such as our process technology we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes there can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us it is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection there are entities whom we believe may infringe our ip enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our ip to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered ip rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

the success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands we believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products any occurrence of counterfeiting imitation or confusion with our brands could adversely affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands which in turn could negatively impact sales of our branded products our share and our gross margin as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution 

flash ventures’ equipment lease agreements contain covenants and other cancellation events and cancellation of the leases would harm our business operating results and financial condition 

flash ventures sells to and leases back a portion of its equipment from a consortium of financial institutions most of the lease obligations are guaranteed 50 by us and 50 by kioxia some of the lease obligations are guaranteed in full by us as of july 3 2020 the portion of outstanding obligations covered by our guarantees totaled approximately 190 billion based upon the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate at july 3 2020 the leases are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors cancellation events include among other things an assignment of all or a substantial part of a guarantor’s business and acceleration of other monetary debts of flash ventures or a guarantor above a specified threshold if a cancellation event were to occur flash ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us increased interest rates or waiver fees if a resolution is not reached we may be required to pay all of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 

if we do not resume paying a quarterly cash dividend or repurchasing shares of our common stock the market price for our common stock could decline 

in april 2020 we suspended our quarterly cash dividend policy in addition we have not repurchased shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program since the first quarter of fiscal 2019 although we will reevaluate paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares of our common stock when appropriate there can be no assurance if when or at what level we may resume these activities if we choose not to or are unable to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock in the future the market price of our common stock may decline 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue cost of revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin in addition our purchases of flashbased memory from flash ventures and our investment in flash ventures are denominated in japanese yen if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar our cost of purchasing flashbased memory wafers and the cost to us of future capital funding of flash ventures would increase if any of these events occur they could have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the us therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the us fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the us 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place thus our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and harm our operating results further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions operating losses third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks our customers’ credit risk may also be exacerbated by an economic downturn or other adverse global or regional economic conditions any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results including those resulting from the seasonality of our business 

• perceptions about our strategic relationships and joint ventures access to supply of flashbased memory new technologies and technology transitions 

• announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of sales of our existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 

• strategic actions by us or competitors such as acquisitions and restructurings 

• periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry consolidation 

• proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments or anticipated or pending investigations proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us or our competitors 

• adverse publicity whether or not justified 

• failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates or changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts relating specifically to us or the storage industry in general 

• announcements relating to dividends and share repurchases and 

• macroeconomic conditions or other events that affect the market generally and in particular developments or events impacting our industry 

in addition the sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales may occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

further a sustained decline in our stock price or market capitalization are among the factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our longlived assets or goodwill may be impaired and if an impairment review is triggered could require us to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements 

our cash balances and investment portfolio are subject to various risks any of which could adversely impact our financial position 

given the international footprint of our business we have both domestic and international cash balances from time to time our investment portfolio may include various holdings security types and maturities our investment portfolio is subject to general credit liquidity market political sovereign and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets our investment portfolio may include investment grade corporate securities bank deposits asset backed securities and us government and agency securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that our investments may experience an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed federal deposit insurance corporation fdic limits could also have an adverse impact on our financial position 

in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to repay our indebtedness fund acquisitions pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock we may choose or be required to increase our borrowings if available or to repatriate funds to the us at an additional tax cost we must comply with regulations regarding the conversion and distribution of funds earned in the local currencies of various countries if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in these countries

key developments 

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and the united states declared a national emergency in the intervening months covid19 has spread globally and led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to reduce its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business limitations and closures subject to exceptions for essential operations and businesses quarantines and shelterinplace orders 

although some of these governmental restrictions have since been lifted or scaled back a recent surge of covid19 infections has resulted in the reimposition of certain restrictions and may lead to other restrictions being reimplemented in response to efforts to reduce the spread of covid19 these measures may remain in place for a significant amount of time in light of these events we have taken actions to protect the health and safety of our employees while continuing to serve our global customers as an essential business we have implemented more thorough sanitation practices as outlined by health organizations and instituted social distancing policies at our locations around the world including working from home limiting the number of employees attending meetings reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time and suspending employee travel these actions have resulted in some reductions of production levels particularly impacting our manufacture of hard drives as we adapt to a more limited number of employees in facilities and as a result we have incurred charges of approximately 110 million in costs related to underabsorbed overhead and higher logistics and other costs during the year ended july 3 2020 

as an essential business we continue to provide products and solutions that enable the proliferation of data and facilitate the sharing of information remotely which has become more critical as much of the world is interacting from areas of selfisolation while we have experienced some reductions of sales in certain areas such as retail in our client solutions end market where brick and mortar operations have been impacted we have seen strong demand for capacity enterprise products in our data center devices and solutions end market as the current environment has accelerated the movement to the cloud as such our net revenue for the year ended july 3 2020 was not significantly impacted by covid19 we currently expect some softening in cloud demand as these customers absorb recent capacity expansions but expect some improvement in retail demand as countries begin to ease their lockdown restrictions and as brick and mortar locations shift more of their operations online however we cannot predict the duration of this crisis and how demand may change if it becomes more protracted 

we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders or as required by federal state or local authorities see “the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition” in part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding the risks we face as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

flash ventures 

through our three business ventures with kioxia corporation “kioxia” referred to as “flash ventures” we and kioxia operate flashbased memory wafer manufacturing facilities in japan we are obligated to pay for variable costs incurred in producing our share of flash ventures’ flashbased memory wafer supply based on our threemonth forecast which generally equals 50 of flash ventures’ output in addition we are obligated to pay for half of flash ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase we are also obligated to fund 499 to 50 of each flash ventures entity’s capital investments to the extent that flash ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments 

since its inception flash ventures’ primary manufacturing site has been located in yokkaichi japan which currently includes five wafer fabrication facilities these facilities historically operated near 100 of their manufacturing capacity as a result of supplydemand imbalance for flashbased products arising in the prior year we temporarily reduced our utilization of our share of flash ventures’ manufacturing capacity to an abnormally low level for several quarters to more closely align our flashbased wafer supply with the projected demand as a result of this temporary reduction to abnormally low production levels we incurred 264 million associated with the reduction in utilization which was recorded as a charge to cost of revenue in the year ended june 28 2019 in addition levels at the yokkaichi site were temporarily reduced as a result of an unexpected power outage incident that occurred in the yokkaichi region on june 15 2019 the power outage incident impacted the facilities and process tools and resulted in the damage of flash wafers in production the incident resulted in a reduction of our flash wafer availability by approximately 4 exabytes the majority of which was contained in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of this power outage incident we incurred aggregate charges of 68 million and 145 million recorded in cost of revenue in the years ended july 3 2020 and june 28 2019 respectively which primarily consisted of the writeoff of damaged inventory and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs we continue to pursue recovery of our losses associated with this event however the total amount of recovery cannot be estimated at this time 

in may 2019 we entered into additional agreements with kioxia to extend flash ventures to a new wafer fabrication facility known as “k1” located in kitakami japan the primary purpose of k1 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flashbased wafer capacity to newer technology nodes output from the initial production line at k1 began in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 although meaningful output from k1 is not expected to begin until the end of calendar 2020 we have paid for most of our share of initial k1 equipment investments and relocation costs other period expenses associated with the initial production ramp at k1 will begin trailing off as output increases toward the end of the calendar year we also agreed to prepay an aggregate of approximately 360 million over a 3year period beginning in the first half of fiscal year 2020 toward k1 building depreciation to be credited against future wafer charges as of july 3 2020 remaining committed prepayments totaled 206 million 

exit of storage systems business 

in september 2019 we announced our intention to exit storage systems which consisted of intelliflash and activescale these actions allow us to redirect investments to other higher value priorities in november 2019 we completed the sale of intelliflash for a price of 28 million to be collected over the next three years the sale of our intelliflash business included an immaterial amount of inventory other tangible and intangible assets and goodwill and resulted in a gain of approximately 17 million recorded in employee termination asset impairment and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended july 3 2020 additionally in march 2020 we completed the sale of activescale the net assets sold and the proceeds from the sale of activescale were not material 

results of operations 

summary comparison of 2020 2019 and 2018 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and percentage of net revenue 1  



1 percentages may not total due to rounding 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding our revenue 1  





1 revenue for 2020 and 2019 are presented in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” topic 606 revenue for 2018 is presented in accordance with asc topic 605 for information related to our transition from topic 605 to topic 606 see part ii item 8 note 1 organization and basis of presentation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

net revenue 

net revenue was relatively flat in 2020 compared to 2019 higher volumes of memory generated approximately 30 percentage points of exabyte growth year over year split relatively evenly between hdd and flash products which was largely offset by lower average selling prices our revenue for data center devices and solutions increased 24 year over year reflecting approximately 46 percentage points of growth in exabytes of storage primarily driven by strength in capacity enterprise hdd and flash which we believe reflects an acceleration in the movement to cloud driven by remote working conditions as a result of covid19 this growth was partially offset by lower average selling prices client devices revenue declined 12 year over year which primarily reflects lower average selling prices in hdd and mobility products client solutions revenue declined 3 year over year which reflects a decline of approximately 12 percentage points due to lower average selling prices primarily on retail products partially offset by an increase in volume of flash products 

the changes in net revenue by geography reflect a decrease in asia in 2020 primarily driven by our decision to limit our participation in the mobile market and our exit from multichip package solutions sales resulting in lower sales to manufacturers in the asia region and a slight increase in the americas driven by increased sales of capacity enterprise hdd 

for 2020 2019 and 2018 our top 10 customers accounted for 42 45 and 42 respectively of our net revenue for each of 2020 2019 and 2018 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2020 2019 and 2018 these programs represented 16 15 and 12 respectively of gross revenues and adjustments to revenue due to changes in accruals for these programs have generally averaged less than 1 of gross revenue over the last three fiscal years the amounts attributed to our sales incentive and marketing programs generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions list pricing strategies seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue 

gross profit and gross margin 

gross profit and gross margin for 2020 were relatively flat compared to 2019 which reflected lower aggregate charges for amortization expense on acquired intangible assets manufacturing underutilization charges and charges related to the power outage incident which aggregated 678 million for 2020 compared to 12 billion for 2019 these lower costs were offset by the impact of lower average selling prices as noted above the impact of covidrelated costs and higher perunit overhead costs in hdd as we ramp up production on our new 18terabyte drives we expect gross margins to be constrained in the near term as we continue to ramp up production on our new drives and continue to incur covidrelated costs 

operating expenses 

research and development “rd” expense increased 79 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to approximately 30 million of additional expense related to the additional week in the current year and increased variable compensation partially offset by savings from our exit from the storage systems business and lower outside services and travel and entertainment “te” spending 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense decreased 164 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to savings realized from our exit from the storage systems business lower outside services and te spending partially offset by approximately 10 million of additional expense related to the additional week in the current year and increased variable compensation 

employee termination asset impairment and other charges decreased from the prior year as many of the actions initiated in the prior year have been substantially completed for additional information regarding employee termination asset impairment and other charges see part ii item 8 note 15 employee termination asset impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

interest and other income expense 

the decreases in total interest and other expense net in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflect decreases in interest expense resulting from the paydown of principal on our debt and lower index rates partially offset by decreases in interest income resulting from lower invested cash and lower rates of return as well as lower gains on foreign currency transactions 

income tax expense 

the following table sets forth income tax information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollar and effective tax rate 



the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 act during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 however the us treasury and the internal revenue service “irs” have issued tax guidance on certain provisions of the 2017 act since the enactment date and we anticipate the issuance of additional regulatory and interpretive guidance we applied a reasonable interpretation of the 2017 act along with the thenavailable guidance in finalizing our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 act any additional regulatory or interpretive guidance would constitute new information which may require further refinements to our estimates in future periods 

the primary drivers of the difference between the effective tax rate for 2020 and the us federal statutory rate of 21 are the relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction the deduction for foreign derived intangible income credits and tax holidays in malaysia philippines and thailand that will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2021 through 2030 in addition the effective tax rate for 2020 includes the discrete effect of a derecognition of 31 million for certain deferred tax assets associated with creditable foreign withholding taxes due to the issuance of final regulatory guidance the regulatory guidance does not preclude us from potentially claiming these creditable taxes as a period benefit when paid 

the primary driver of the difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended june 28 2019 and the us federal statutory rate of 21 is the discrete effect of the finalization of the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 act these discrete effects consist of 119 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax and 189 million related to the decision to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion the remaining difference is attributable primarily to a change in the estimated effective tax rate due to changes in the relative mix of earnings by jurisdiction partially offset by credits and tax holidays 

our future effective tax rate is subject to future regulatory developments and changes in the mix of our us earnings compared to foreign earnings our total tax expense in future fiscal years may also vary as a result of discrete items such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies 

for additional information regarding income tax expense benefit see part ii item 8 note 13 income tax expense  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

a discussion of our results of operations for 2018 including a comparison of such results of operations to 2019 is included in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended june 28 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 27 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows 



we believe our cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in part i item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

during fiscal 2021 we expect expenditures for property plant and equipment for our company plus our portion of the capital expenditures by our flash ventures joint venture with kioxia for its operations to aggregate approximately 31 billion after consideration of the flash ventures’ lease financing of its capital expenditures and net operating cash flow we expect net cash used for our purchases of property plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable relating to flash ventures to be a cash outflow of approximately 13 billion during fiscal 2021 the total expected cash to be used could vary depending on the timing and completion of various capital projects and the availability timing and terms of related financing  

during fiscal 2019 we made the determination that it was our intention to repatriate all of our foreign undistributed earnings as a result of the 2017 act except a portion of our foreign undistributed earnings which could result in additional federal taxes based on interpretive guidance issued by the irs after consideration of this interpretative guidance affecting the taxation of a certain portion of our foreign undistributed earnings we made the determination that we do not intend to repatriate this portion of our foreign undistributed earnings and did not establish an accrual for this liability of 125 billion 

a total of 212 billion and 237 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the us as of july 3 2020 and june 28 2019 respectively as a result of the change in our permanent reinvestment assertion there are no material tax consequences that were not previously accrued for on the repatriation of this cash 

operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus changes in operating assets and liabilities this represents our principal source of cash net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities was 757 million for 2020 as compared to 260 million net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities for 2019 changes in our operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by our working capital requirements which are dependent on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle as well as timing of payments for taxes our cash conversion cycle measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the cash conversion cycles were as follows 



changes in days sales outstanding “dso” are generally due to the linearity of shipments changes in days in inventory “dio” are generally related to the timing of inventory builds changes in days payables outstanding “dpo” are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

for 2020 dso increased by 26 days over the prior year reflecting 6 days for lower factoring of receivables and 4 days resulting from balance sheet reclassifications of certain customer incentives in connection with the adoption of asc topic 606 related to recognition of agreements with customers the additional increase primarily reflects the timing of shipments and customer collections we have seen no significant deterioration in our receivables as a result of covid19 dio decreased by 8 days over the prior year reflecting higher stocking levels of hdd inventory in the prior year in response to the plant closure in kuala lumpur dpo increased by 12 days over the prior year primarily reflecting resumptions of flash production volumes as well as routine variations in the timing of purchases and payments during the period 

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of a 931 million net decrease in notes receivable issuances to flash ventures partially offset by 647 million of capital expenditures and 22 million for acquisitions net cash used in investing activities in 2019 primarily consisted of 876 million of capital expenditures and a net 598 million increase in notes receivable issuances to flash ventures to fund its capital expansion 

our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in us treasury securities and us government agency securities in addition from time to time we invest directly in us treasury securities us and international government agency securities certificates of deposit asset backed securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds 

financing activities 

during 2020 net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of 982 million for repayment of debt of which 257 million was for scheduled principal payments and 725 million was for voluntary prepayments 595 million to pay dividends on our common stock and 72 million for taxes paid on vested stock awards under employee stock plans partially offset by 141 million of cash from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans net cash used in financing activities in 2019 primarily consisted of 681 million for the repayment of our revolving credit facility and other debt 584 million to pay dividends on our common stock and 563 million for share repurchases on july 31 2020 we made an incremental voluntary prepayment of 150 million on our term loan b4 

in april 2020 we suspended our dividend policy to reinvest in the business and to support our ongoing deleveraging efforts we will reevaluate our dividend policy as our leverage ratio improves

unrecognized tax benefits 

as of july 3 2020 the liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding accrued interest and penalties was approximately 717 million accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of july 3 2020 was approximately 137 million of these amounts approximately 720 million could result in potential cash payments we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax payments related to these obligations 

interest rate swap 

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt at july 3 2020 we had 628 billion of variable rate debt comprising 65 of the par value of our debt to balance the portfolio and moderate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates underlying our variable debt we entered into payfixed interest rate swaps on 200 billion notional amount which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through february 2023 after giving effect to the 200 billion of interest rate swaps we effectively had 428 billion of longterm debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 43 million 

foreign exchange contracts

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 500 billion of our common stock which authorization is effective through july 25 2023 for the year ended july 3 2020 we did not make any stock repurchases and have not repurchased any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program since the first quarter of fiscal 2019 although we will reevaluate the repurchasing of our common stock when appropriate there can be no assurance if when or at what level we may resume such activity the remaining amount available to be repurchased under our current stock repurchase program as of july 3 2020 was 450 billion repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a rule 10b51 plan

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 note 2 recent accounting pronouncements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue 

we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions we also provide resellers and original equipment manufacturers “oems” with other sales incentive programs the company records estimated variable consideration related to these items as a reduction to revenue at the time of revenue recognition we use judgment in our assessment of variable consideration in contracts to be included in the transaction price we use the expected value method to arrive at the amount of variable consideration the company is constraining variable consideration until the likelihood of a significant revenue reversal is not probable and believes that the expected value method is the appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration based on the fact that we have a large number of contracts with similar characteristics 

for sales to oems the company’s methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on the amount of consideration expected to be earned based on the oems’ volume of purchases from the company or other agreed upon sales incentive programs for sales to resellers the methodology for estimating variable consideration is based on several factors including historical pricing information current pricing trends and channel inventory levels differences between the estimated and actual amounts of variable consideration are recognized as adjustments to revenue 

marketing development program costs are typically recorded as a reduction of the transaction price and therefore of revenue we net sales rebates against open customer receivable balances if the criteria to offset are met otherwise they are recorded within other accrued liabilities 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates for additional information see part ii item 8 note 16 legal proceedings  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized we account for interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to perform a quantitative approach to determine the amount of impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of one or more reporting units if we had more than one reporting unit judgment would also be required in the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit if our stock price decreases significantly goodwill could become impaired which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations 

other longlived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets the estimates of fair 

value require evaluation of future market conditions and product lifecycles as well as projected revenue earnings and cash flow 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for product costs and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations substantially all of the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes for additional information see part ii item 8 note 4 fair value measurements and investments and note 5 derivative instruments and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

due to macroeconomic changes and volatility experienced in the foreign exchange market recently we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as a result of market movement therefore we have performed sensitivity analyses for 2020 and 2019 using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant the analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts used to offset the underlying exposures the foreign currency exchange rates used in performing the sensitivity analyses were based on market rates in effect at july 3 2020 and june 28 2019 the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of 135 million and 82 million at july 3 2020 and june 28 2019 respectively 

during 2020 2019 and 2018 total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

disclosure about interest rate risk 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan a1 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted london interbank offered rate “libor” subject to a 00 floor plus an applicable margin varying from 1125 to 2000 or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0125 to 1000 in each case depending on our corporate credit ratings as of july 3 2020 the applicable margin based on our current credit ratings was 15 borrowings under our term loan b4 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor subject to a 00 floor plus a margin of 175 or a base rate plus a margin of 075 

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt at july 3 2020 65 of the par value of our debt was at variable rates to balance the portfolio and moderate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates underlying our variable debt we entered into payfixed interest rate swaps on 200 billion notional amount which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through february 2023 as of july 3 2020 we had 628 billion of variable rate debt after giving effect to the 200 billion of interest rate swaps we effectively had 428 billion of longterm debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 43 million

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by sec rule 13a‑15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a‑15f and 15d‑15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013 based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see report of independent registered public accounting firm herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended july 3 2020 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we are implementing an enterprise resource planning “erp” system on a worldwide basis which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes the gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years we have completed the implementation of certain processes including the financial consolidation and reporting fixed assets supplier management and indirect procuretopay processes and have revised and updated the related controls these changes did not materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as we implement the remaining functionality under this erp system over the next several years we will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights 

we have more than 14000 active patents worldwide and have many patent applications in process we continually seek additional united states “us” and international patents on our technology we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products also depends upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for cannot alone ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented ip particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the laws of the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own ip portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills human resources and training to continue to be successful and to grow our manufacturing operations as necessary we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our production of hdd and flashbased products are highvolume and utilization lowcost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity we continually monitor our manufacturing capabilities to respond to the changing requirements of our customers and maintain our competitiveness and position as a data technology leader 

hdd and flashbased product manufacturing are complex processes involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and rigorous testing the manufacturing processes involve a number of steps that are dependent on each other and occur in “clean room” environments that demand skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of these manufacturing environments we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

substantially all of our flashbased supply requirements for our flashbased products is obtained from our business ventures with tmc which provide us with leadingedge highquality and lowcost flash memory wafers this represents our captive supply and we are obligated to take our share of the output from these ventures or pay the fixed costs associated with that capacity see “ventures with toshiba memory” below for additional information while substantially all of our flash memory supply utilized for our products is purchased from these ventures from timetotime we also purchase flash memory from other flash manufacturers which we refer to as noncaptive while we do not unilaterally control the operations of our ventures with tmc we believe that our business venture relationship with tmc helps us to reduce the costs of producing our products increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers our vertically integrated manufacturing operations for our flashbased products are concentrated in three locations with our business ventures with tmc located in yokkaichi japan and our inhouse assembly and test operations located in shanghai china and penang malaysia 

we also leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

materials and supplies 

hdd consists primarily of recording heads magnetic media and a printed circuit board assembly we design and manufacture substantially all of the recording heads and magnetic media required for our products as a result we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less reliant on recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers we depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our hdd product design and manufacturing 

our flashbased products consist of flash memory controllers and firmwares substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by our business ventures with tmc controllers are primarily designed inhouse and manufactured by thirdparty foundries or acquired from thirdparty suppliers we believe the use of our inhouse assembly and test facilities as well as contract manufacturers provides flexibility and gives us access to increased production capacity we have developed deep relationships with these vendors and tmc to establish continuous supply of flashbased memory and controllers 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for our component requirements but in some instances use sole or single sources for business or technology reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

ventures with toshiba memory 

we and tmc currently operate three business ventures in 300millimeter flashbased manufacturing facilities in japan which provide us leadingedge costcompetitive flashbased memory wafers for our end products through flash partners ltd flash alliance ltd and flash forward ltd which we collectively refer to as flash ventures we and tmc collaborate in the development and manufacture of flashbased memory wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the flash venture entities we hold a 499 ownership position in each of the flash venture entities each flash venture entity purchases wafers from tmc at cost and then resells those wafers to us and tmc at cost plus a markup we are obligated to pay for variable costs incurred in producing our share of flash ventures’ flashbased memory wafer supply based on our three month forecast which generally equals 50 of flash ventures’ output in addition we are obligated to pay for half of flash ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase we are also obligated to fund 499 to 50 of flash ventures’ capital investments to the extent that flash ventures’ operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments we and tmc also collaborate on certain rd activities in support of flash ventures 

the agreements governing the operations of the flash venture entities also set out a framework for any investment by the joint venture partners in flash manufacturing capacity since its inception flash ventures has been based in a manufacturing site in yokkaichi japan that is owned and operated by tmc the yokkaichi site currently includes five wafer fabrication facilities the newest of which is known as “y6” we have jointly invested and intend to continue to jointly invest with tmc in manufacturing equipment for y6 in may 2019 we entered into additional agreements to extend flash ventures to a new wafer fabrication facility known as “k1” k1 is currently under construction at a site in kitakami iwate japan that is operated by toshiba memory corporation iwate a wholly owned subsidiary of tmc as with y6 the primary purpose of k1 is to provide clean room space to continue the transition of existing flashbased wafer capacity to newer technology nodes

sales and distribution 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 78  78 and 80 of our net revenue for 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and by providing information and support through our website in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs while these groups of customers make up our end markets some of these customers cross into multiple groups we define these customers as follows 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale data center operators  system integrators and cloud customers who bundle embed or integrate our storage solutions purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations in addition we sell directly to cloud infrastructure players as well as flash storage solutions to customers that offer our products under their own brand name in the retail market which we also classify as oems 

distributors we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and consumer electronics “ce” manufacturers dealers valueadded resellers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our websites 

for each of 2019  2018 and 2017  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information regarding revenue recognition and major customers see part ii item 8 note 1  organization and basis of presentation and note 10  business segment revenue information geographic information and concentration of risk  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of sale depending on the type of product with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten years or more our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for additional information regarding our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1  organization and basis of presentation and note 3  supplemental financial statement data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k  

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties whether currently known or unknown any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or from anticipated future results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but represent risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our common stock 

adverse global or regional conditions could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and many of our products and components are produced overseas as a result our business results of operations and financial condition depend significantly on global and regional conditions adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions including but not limited to volatility in the financial markets tighter credit slower growth in certain geographic regions political uncertainty other macroeconomic factors and changes to policies rules and regulations could significantly harm demand for our products increase credit and collectability risks result in revenue reductions increase manufacturing and operating costs or result in impairment charges or other expenses 

our revenue and future growth are significantly dependent on the growth of international markets and we may face difficulties in entering or maintaining international sales markets we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing and sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of and reliance on contract manufacturers including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of these risks our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba memory corporation “tmc” for the development and supply of flashbased memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our ventures with tmc to develop and manufacture our flashbased memory we partner with tmc on the development of flashbased technology including future generations of 3d nand as well as other nonvolatile memory technology in support of flash ventures flash ventures is subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments our revenue and costs our future rate of spending our technology plans and our future growth opportunities 

substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by flash ventures which limits our ability to respond to market demand and supply changes a failure to accurately forecast demand could cause us to overinvest or underinvest in technology transitions or the expansion of flash ventures’ capacity overinvestment by us or our competitors could result in excess supply which could cause significant decreases in our product prices significant excess obsolete inventory or inventory writedowns or underutilization charges and the potential impairment of our investments in flash ventures on the other hand if we underinvest in flash ventures or otherwise grow or transition flash ventures’ capacity more slowly than we expect or than the rest of the industry we may not have enough supply of the right type of memory or at all to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis and we may lose opportunities for revenue gross margin and market share as a result if our supply is limited we may make strategic decisions with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers and these strategic allocation decisions may result in less favorable gross margin or damage certain customer relationships we are contractually obligated to pay for 50 of the fixed costs of flash ventures regardless of whether we purchase any wafers from flash ventures furthermore purchase orders placed with flash ventures and under the foundry arrangements with tmc for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled therefore once our purchase decisions have been made our production costs for flash memory are fixed and we may be unable to reduce costs to match any subsequent declines in pricing or demand which would harm our gross margin our limited ability to react to fluctuations in flash memory supply and demand makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations 

under the flash ventures agreements we have limited power to unilaterally direct most of the activities that most significantly impact flash ventures’ performance and we have limited ability to source or fabricate flashbased memory outside of flash ventures lack of alignment with tmc with respect to flash ventures could adversely impact our ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancement and our investment in flash ventures and otherwise harm our business misalignment could arise due to changes in tmc’s strategic priorities andor ownership which has changed significantly recently and could continue to change tmc’s stakeholders may include or have included in the past flash and hdd competitors customers a private equity firm and a bank owned by the government of japan tmc’s ownership and capital structure could lead to delays in decisionmaking disputes or changes in strategic direction that could adversely impact flash ventures andor adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition there may exist conflicts of interest between tmc’s stakeholders and flash ventures or us with respect to among other things protecting and growing flash ventures’ business ip and competitively sensitive confidential information 

flash ventures requires significant investments by both tmc and us for technology transitions including the transition to 3d nand and capacity expansions tmc’s parent company toshiba memory holdings corporation “tmhc” recently announced new financing in the amount of 12 trillion japanese yen tmhc’s financing agreements andor its high level of debt could limit tmc’s ability to timely fund or finance investments in flash ventures or our joint development efforts as well as limit flash ventures’ ability to enter into lease financings to the extent that lease financings for flash ventures are not accessible on favorable terms or at all more cash would be required to fund investments if tmc does not or we do not provide sufficient resources or have adequate access to credit to timely fund investments in flash ventures our investments could be delayed or reduced delayed or reduced investment in manufacturing capacity or rd could harm flash ventures’ competitiveness andor our investment in flash ventures in addition tmhc’s financing arrangements might be secured by tmc’s equity interests in flash ventures permitting the lenders to foreclose on those equity interests under certain circumstances 

in may 2019 we entered into definitive agreements with tmc regarding a new 3d nand wafer fabrication facility in kitakami iwate japan known as “k1” under the k1 agreement we agreed to among other things fund 50 of k1’s initial production line output from the initial production line which is expected in the first half of calendar year 2020 could be delayed reduced or otherwise fail to meet our expectations as k1 is located at a new manufacturing site k1 could be particularly susceptible to delays and other challenges in the production ramp and yields qualification of wafers shipment of samples to customers and customer approval process further although we intend to continue to jointly invest with tmc to ramp up manufacturing capacity at k1 there is no certainty as to when and on what terms we will do so if and for so long as our share of the k1 capacity falls below a specified threshold we will be responsible for bearing fixed costs associated with k1’s operations at that threshold which could adversely affect our financial results 

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining average selling prices “asps” volatile demand rapid technological change and industry consolidation all of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

demand for our devices software and solutions that we offer to our customers which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems including personal computers “pcs” and mobile devices manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period the prices of our products are influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand in the storage market including the effects of new fab capacity macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors the storage market has experienced volatile product life cycles which can adversely affect our ability to recover the cost of product development and periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories significant reductions in asps and adverse impacts on our revenue and gross margins 

further our asps and gross margins tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of revenue rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence finally the data storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years further consolidation across the industry could enhance the capacity abilities and resources and lower the cost structure of some of our competitors causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage these factors may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share all of which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

in addition we compete based on our ability to offer our customers competitive solutions that provide the most current and desired products and service features as we compete in new product areas the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and may result in increases in rd expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability we must also qualify our products with customers through potentially lengthy testing processes which may result in delayed reduced or lost product sales some of our competitors offer products and technologies that we do not offer and may be able to use their broader product and technology portfolio to win sales from us and some of our customers may be developing storage solutions internally which may reduce their demand for our products we expect that competition will continue to be intense and there is a risk that our competitors may be able to gain a product offering or cost structure advantage over us which may result in a loss of business to us further some of our competitors may utilize certain pricing strategies including offering products at prices at or below cost that we may be unable to competitively match we may also have difficulty effectively competing with manufacturers benefitting from governmental investments 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions and product development and introduction our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate and adapt our existing products or develop new products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement new technologies successfully if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies or if our technology transitions or product development are more costly to complete than anticipated we may not be able to offer products our customers desire and our costs may not remain competitive which would harm revenues our gross margin and operating results 

in addition the success of our technology transitions and product development and introduction depends on a number of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moving to new technologies and products may require us to align to and build a new supply base our success in new product areas may be dependent in part on our ability to develop close relationships with new suppliers and on our ability to enter into favorable supply agreements where this cannot be done our business and operations may be adversely affected in addition if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting technologies to implement these new technologies are not available we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position 

additionally new technologies and products could substitute for or replace our current technologies and products and make them obsolete we also develop products to meet certain industry and technical standards which may change we could incur substantial costs as a result of shifts in technology and standards such as adopting new standards or investing in different capital equipment or manufacturing processes to remain competitive 

for additional technology transition risks related to flash ventures see the risk factor entitled “ we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba memory corporation “tmc” for the development and supply of flashbased memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results ” 

our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have entered into strategic relationships with various partners for future product development sales growth and the supply of technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing including our partnership with tmc for flashbased memory development and manufacturing these strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations and financial condition these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our strategic relationships are unsuccessful or there are unanticipated changes in or termination of our strategic relationships our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers who provide critical materials or components and a disruption in our supply chain including a shortage in supply or a supplier’s failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us or supplier consolidation could adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results  

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware preamps controllers dram components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing chip assembly product assembly and product testing and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our justintime hubs distribution centers and freight from suppliers to our factories and from our factories to our customers throughout the world many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products technology and equipment 

from time to time our suppliers have experienced difficulty meeting our requirements if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers or if we cannot purchase materials at a reasonable price we may not be able to meet demand for our products trade restrictions including tariffs quotas and embargoes demand from other high volume industries for materials or components used in our products or shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in increased costs to us or decreased demand for our products which could negatively impact our operating results delays or cost increases experienced by our suppliers in developing or sourcing materials and components for use in our products or incompatibility or quality issues relating to our products could also harm our financial results as well as business relationships with our customers 

we do not have longterm contracts with some of our existing suppliers nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers and therefore we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our products any significant problems that occur at our suppliers or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems either of which would harm our operating results and financial condition when we do have contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components those commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components and may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory which could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our operating results 

in addition our supply base has experienced industry consolidation our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors consolidate decide to exit the industry or redirect their investments and increase costs to us each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition some of our suppliers have experienced a decline in financial performance where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation or a decline in financial performance is enhanced some of our suppliers may also be competitors in other areas of our business which could lead to difficulties in price negotiations or meeting our supply requirements any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results 

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as a power outage terrorist attack political instability civil unrest localized labor unrest or other employment issues or a localized health risk that adversely affects any of these facilities the employees the technology infrastructure or logistics operators at these facilities would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and source components which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results in addition the geographic concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from any of these problems a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

we may incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the scope of the coverage of our insurance policies there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially due to market availability pricing or other reasons we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some cases no coverage at all for natural disasters and environmental damages as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost we depend upon tmc to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash ventures if tmc fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses and such failure could also cause flash ventures to breach various financing covenants 

we experience sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate in addition accurately forecasting demand has become more difficult which could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

sales of computer systems mobile devices storage subsystems gaming consoles and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and subject to supplydemand cycles and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in supply dynamics and customer demand changes in seasonal and cyclical supply and demand patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions actions by competitors new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

the variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on accurately forecasting market and customer demand for our products accurately forecasting demand has also become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers due to volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand we could experience periods of product oversupply excess inventory and price decreases which could impact our sales asps and gross margin thereby adversely affecting our operating results and our financial condition if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

the loss of our key management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the technology related industry is intense and our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to implement succession plans for our key management and staff to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees including employees from acquisitions and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business including through equity compensation when our operating results are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees versus other companies that may pay a relatively higher portion of base compensation if we are unable to hire and retain key management staff or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions which are a key part of our growth strategy it may adversely affect our future results 

we seek to be an industryleading developer manufacturer and provider of innovative storage solutions balancing our core hard drive and flash memory business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all there may be difficulties with implementing new systems and processes or with integrating systems and processes of companies with complex operations which could result in inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and may increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition or changes in technology development and related roadmaps following an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition acquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our shareholders and the issuance of additional indebtedness that would put additional pressure on liquidity furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest with or in certain other countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so including investments in joint ventures minority investments and outbound technology transfers to certain countries 

any cost saving initiatives restructurings or divestitures that we undertake may result in disruptions to our operations and may not deliver the results we expect which may adversely affect our business 

from time to time we engage in cost saving initiatives restructurings and divestitures that may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our manufacturing or other facilities as a result of these actions we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods these actions could also impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that these actions will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or consolidations or that we do not forego future business opportunities as a result of these actions if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our operating results could be adversely affected 

our high level of debt may adversely impact our liquidity restrict our operations and ability to respond to business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

as of june 28 2019  our total indebtedness was 1069 billion in aggregate principal and we had 225 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

our ability to meet the debt service obligations and to comply with our debt covenants depends on our cash flows and financial performance which are affected by financial business economic and other factors failure to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our debt covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness we may be unable to cure or obtain a waiver of an event of default or otherwise amend our debt agreements to prevent an event of default thereunder on terms acceptable to us or at all in that event the debt holders could accelerate the related debt which may result in the crossacceleration or crossdefault of other debt leases or other obligations we may not have sufficient funds available to repay accelerated indebtedness and we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities which we may be unable to do on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs 

as our bank debt contains a variable interest rate component based on our corporate credit ratings a decline in our ratings could result in increased interest rates and debt service obligations in addition our ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies as to our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

our credit agreement uses libor as a reference rate for our term loans and revolving credit facility such that the applicable interest rate may at our option be calculated based on libor in july 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in april 2018 the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing a secured overnight funding rate which is intended to replace us dollar libor plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced at this time we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to libor or the discontinuation of libor if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt which could adversely impact our interest expense results of operations and cash flows 

we may from time to time seek to further refinance our substantial indebtedness by issuing additional shares of common stock which may dilute our existing shareholders reduce the value of our common stock or both 

tax matters may materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

changes in tax laws in the united states the european union and around the globe have impacted and will continue to impact our effective worldwide tax rate which may materially affect our financial position and results of operations further organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations additionally portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met we may not be able to meet such conditions if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future 

our determination of our tax liability in the us and other jurisdictions is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 13  income tax expense  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received statutory notices of deficiency seeking certain adjustments to income and have filed petitions with the us tax court although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in litigation or the payment of significant amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

sales in the distribution channel and to the retail market are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes within these markets or maintain and grow our applicable market share our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel our operating results would be adversely affected negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances 

a significant portion of our sales is also made through retailers our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple retail market channels particularly in the retail market adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors if customers no longer maintain a preference for our product brands or if our retailers are not successful in selling our products our operating results may be adversely affected 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the fiscal year ended june 28 2019  45 of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance we have experienced and may in the future experience events such as the loss of a key customer prohibition or restriction of sales to a key customer by law regulation or other government action reductions in orders of our products by a key customer customer requirements to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs or the acquisition of a key customer by one of our competitors these events would likely harm our operating results and financial condition 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products increased customer pressure on our prices replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as mobile social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems design defects or sustain system failures our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors service providers cloud solution providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks cyber attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism or fraud by third parties and sabotage in some instances efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent attacks may reduce the performance of our computer systems and networks which could negatively impact our business we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities 

our products are also targets for cyber attacks including those products utilized in cloudbased environments as well as our cloud service offerings while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers further our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects exposing us to litigation and indemnification claims and hurting our reputation 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result we could experience additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use sharing and security of thirdparty data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm  

we are subject to laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use and security of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data and employee data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated litigation or indemnification claims 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur including as a result of thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate in our products which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition product defects product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships lost revenue indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products warranty claims litigation or loss of market share with our customers including our oem and original design manufacturers “odm” customers our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provision do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the responsible business alliance “rba” and compliance with those requirements could cause an increase in our operating costs and failure to comply may harm our business 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers customers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products which could impair our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions or with certain customers and harm our operating results in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our suppliers customers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation certain customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the rba the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we or our suppliers customers or partners were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer 

we and certain of our officers are at times involved in litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which may be costly may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings fines or penalties which could materially harm our business 

we are involved in litigation including antitrust and commercial matters putative securities class action suits and other actions we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others some of the actions seek injunctive relief including injunctions against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results from time to time we may also be the subject of inquiries requests for information investigations and actions by government and regulatory agencies regarding our businesses any such matters could result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including fines penalties or restrictions on our business activities 

litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations in the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation investigation or governmental proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities including the manufacture use and sale of products with or without merit such matters can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by us could also result in counterclaims against us which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us in addition litigation investigations or governmental proceedings and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel and may also harm the market prices of our securities 

we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation investigations or governmental proceedings these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits the cost of governmental law enforcement or regulatory investigations or proceedings civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measures if any which may be imposed 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other ip rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we have historically been involved in frequent disputes regarding patent and other ip rights and we have in the past received and we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other ip rights we may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license ip to others ip risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no ip protection as a defense against litigation the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of ip litigation increase the ip risks we face litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may be subject to injunctions enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

if we incorporate thirdparty technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the ip of others we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier customer or partner could negatively impact our business 

moreover from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged ip infringement the scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses including attorneys’ fees we may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

our reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable ip such as our process technology we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes there can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us it is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection there are entities whom we believe may infringe our ip enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our ip to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered ip rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

the success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands we believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products any occurrence of counterfeiting imitation or confusion with our brands could adversely affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands which in turn could negatively impact sales of our branded products our share and our gross margin as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution 

flash ventures’ equipment lease agreements contain covenants and other cancellation events and cancellation of the leases would harm our business operating results and financial condition 

flash ventures sells to and leases back a portion of its equipment from a consortium of financial institutions most of the lease obligations are guaranteed 50 by us and 50 by tmc some of the lease obligations are guaranteed in full by us as of june 28 2019  the portion of outstanding obligations covered by our guarantees totaled approximately 158 billion  based upon the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate at june 28 2019  the leases are subject to customary covenants and cancellation events that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors cancellation events include among other things an assignment of all or a substantial part of a guarantor’s business and acceleration of other monetary debts of flash ventures or a guarantor above a specified threshold if a cancellation event were to occur flash ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us increased interest rates or waiver fees if a resolution is not reached we may be required to pay all of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 

any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or to reduce or discontinue repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time in addition we may start stop or vary repurchases of shares of our common stock as we deem appropriate and as market conditions allow any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of shares of our common stock are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue cost of revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin in addition our purchases of flashbased memory from flash ventures and our investment in flash ventures are denominated in japanese yen if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar our cost of purchasing flashbased memory wafers and the cost to us of future capital funding of flash ventures would increase if any of these events occur they could have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the us therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the us fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the us 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts may not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place thus our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and harm our operating results further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions operating losses third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

 



 

 

 

 

in addition changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales may occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

further a sustained decline in our stock price or market capitalization are among the factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our longlived assets or goodwill may be impaired and if an impairment review is triggered could require us to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements 

our cash balances and investment portfolio are subject to various risks any of which could adversely impact our financial position 

given the international footprint of our business we have both domestic and international cash balances from time to time our investment portfolio may include various holdings security types and maturities our investment portfolio is subject to general credit liquidity market political sovereign and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets our investment portfolio may include investment grade corporate securities bank deposits asset backed securities and us government and agency securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that our investments may experience an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed federal deposit insurance corporation fdic limits could also have an adverse impact on our financial position 

in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to repay our indebtedness fund acquisitions pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock we may choose or be required to increase our borrowings if available or to repatriate funds to the us at an additional tax cost we must comply with regulations regarding the conversion and distribution of funds earned in the local currencies of various countries if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in these countries

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for product costs and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations substantially all of the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months  we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes for additional information see part ii item 8  note 4  fair value measurements and investments and note 5  derivative instruments and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k 

as of june 28 2019  we had outstanding the foreign exchange contracts presented in the following table the designated foreign exchange contracts are entered to protect the us dollar value of our product cost and operating expenses changes in fair values of the nondesignated foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income expense net and are largely offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 





 

during 2019  2018 and 2017  total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements  

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

disclosure about other market risks 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan a1 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted london interbank offered rate “libor” subject to a 00 floor plus an applicable margin varying from 1125 to 2000 or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0125 to 1000  in each case depending on our corporate credit ratings as of june 28 2019  the applicable margin based on our current credit ratings was 15  borrowings under our us term loan b4 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor subject to a 00 floor plus a margin of 175 or a base rate plus a margin of 075  

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt at june 28 2019  68 of the par value of our debt was at variable rates to balance the portfolio we entered into payfixed interest rate swaps on 200 billion notional amount which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through february 2023 as of june 28 2019  we had 726 billion of variable rate debt after giving effect to the 200 billion of interest rate swaps we effectively had 526 billion of longterm debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 53 million

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by sec rule 13a‑15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a‑15f and 15d‑15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013 based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see report of independent registered public accounting firm herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 28 2019  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we are implementing an enterprise resource planning “erp” system on a worldwide basis which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes the gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years we have completed the implementation of certain processes including the financial consolidation and reporting fixed assets supplier management and indirect procuretopay processes and have revised and updated the related controls these changes did not materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as we implement the remaining functionality under this erp system over the next several years we will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner rd expenses totaled 240 billion  244 billion  and 163 billion  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights 

we have more than 14000  active patents worldwide and have many patent applications in process we continually seek additional united states “us” and international patents on our technology we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products also depends upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for cannot alone ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented ip particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the laws of the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own ip portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills human resources and training to continue to be successful and to grow our manufacturing operations as necessary we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our production of hdd and flashbased products are highvolume and utilization lowcost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity we continually monitor our manufacturing capabilities to respond to the changing requirements of our customers and maintain our competitiveness and position as a data technology leader 

hdd and flashbased product manufacturing are complex processes involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and rigorous testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

substantially all of our flashbased supply requirements for our flashbased products is obtained from our business ventures with tmc which provide us with leadingedge highquality and lowcost flashbased memory wafers this represents a captive supply and we are obligated to take our share of the output from these ventures or pay the fixed costs associated with that capacity see “ventures with toshiba memory” below for additional information while substantially all of our flash memory supply utilized for our products is purchased from these ventures from timetotime we also purchase flash memory from other flashbased manufacturers which we refer to as noncaptive while we do not unilaterally control the operations of these ventures we believe that our business venture relationship with tmc helps us to reduce the costs of producing our products increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers our vertically integrated manufacturing operations for our flashbased products are concentrated in three locations with our business ventures with tmc located in yokkaichi japan and our inhouse assembly and test operations located in shanghai china and penang malaysia 

we also leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

materials and supplies 

hdd primarily consists of recording heads magnetic media and a printed circuit board assembly we design and manufacture substantially all of the recording heads and magnetic media required for our products as a result we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less reliant on recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers we depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our hdd product design and manufacturing 

our flashbased product consists of flashbased memory and controllers substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by our business ventures with tmc controllers are primarily designed inhouse and manufactured by thirdparty foundries or acquired from thirdparty suppliers we believe the use of our inhouse assembly and test facilities as well as contract manufacturers provides flexibility and gives us access to increased production capacity we have developed deep relationships with these vendors and tmc to establish continuous supply of flashbased memory and controllers 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for our component requirements but in some instances use sole or single sources for business or technology reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

ventures with toshiba memory 

we and tmc currently operate three business ventures in 300millimeter flashbased manufacturing facilities in yokkaichi japan which provide us leadingedge costcompetitive flashbased memory wafers for our end products through flash partners ltd flash alliance ltd and flash forward ltd which we collectively refer to as flash ventures we and tmc collaborate in the development and manufacture of flashbased memory wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the flash venture entities we hold a 499 ownership position in each of the flash venture entities each flash venture entity purchases wafers from tmc at cost and then resells those wafers to us and tmc at cost plus a markup we are obligated to purchase half of flash ventures’ flashbased memory wafer supply or pay for half of flash ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase we are also obligated to fund 499 to 50 of flash ventures’ investments to the extent that flash ventures’ operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments we and tmc also collaborate on certain rd activities in support of flash ventures 

the agreements governing the operations of the flash venture entities also set out a framework for any investment by the joint venture partners in nand manufacturing capacity flash ventures’ manufacturing site in yokkaichi japan is owned and operated by tmc and includes five wafer fabrication facilities the newest of which are known as “new fab 2” and “fab 6” the primary purpose of new fab 2 and fab 6 is to provide clean room space to support the continued conversion of existing 2dimensional “2d” nand wafer capacity to 3d nand we have jointly invested and intend to continue to jointly invest with tmc in manufacturing equipment for these facilities in addition tmc has announced that it is starting construction of a new wafer fabrication facility for the manufacture of 3d nand in kitakami iwate japan pursuant to our agreements governing flash ventures which give us priority to participate in expansions and conversions of nand manufacturing capacity we intend to jointly invest with tmc in manufacturing equipment at the new facility in kitakami based on our ongoing discussions with tmc 

on june 1 2018 tmc formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of toshiba corporation was purchased by a consortium led by bain capital the “bain consortium” that includes sk hynix inc and other competitors as well as key customers

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and by providing information and support through our website in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs while these groups of customers make up our end markets some of these customers cross into multiple groups we define these customers as follows 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale data center operators   system integrators and cloud customers who bundle embed or integrate our storage solutions purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations in addition we sell directly to cloud infrastructure players as well as flash storage solutions to customers that offer our products under their own brand name in the retail market which we also classify as oems 

distributors  we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and consumer electronics “ce” manufacturers dealers valueadded resellers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our websites 

for each of 2018  2017  and 2016  no single customer accounted for 10  or more of our net revenue for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customers see part ii item 8 note 1  organization and basis of presentation  and note 10  business segment geographic information and concentration of risk  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form 10‑k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of sale depending on the type of product with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten years or more our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for additional information regarding our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1  organization and basis of presentation  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action 

for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

employees 

as of june 29 2018  we employed a total of approximately 71600  employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs that we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement a majority of our employees in japan and china are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k

risk factors   

tableend 

our business financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties whether currently known or unknown any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or from anticipated future results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our common stock 

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole several factors contribute to these conditions and this uncertainty including but not limited to volatility in the equity credit and other financial markets and real estate markets slower growth in certain geographic regions lower levels of consumer liquidity risk of default on sovereign debt higher interest rates materials and component cost increases political uncertainty and other macroeconomic factors such as the trade and tariff actions recently announced by the us china and other countries and changes to policies rules and regulations some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these conditions include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

these actions and conditions could result in reductions in our revenue increased operating costs impairment charges and other expenses which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba memory corporation “tmc” for the supply of flashbased memory and the development of flashbased technology which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on our ventures with tmc to develop and manufacture flashbased memory products for our flashbased memory supply and therefore our business financial condition and operating results are dependent on the continued success of flash ventures we partner with tmc on the development of flashbased technology including the next technology transitions of flashbased memory as well as other nonvolatile memory technology in support of flash ventures flash ventures is subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments our revenue and costs our future rate of spending our technology plans and our future growth opportunities 

substantially all of our flashbased memory is supplied by flash ventures which limits our ability to respond to market demand and supply changes a failure to accurately forecast demand could cause us to overinvest or underinvest in technology transitions or the expansion of captive memory capacity in flash ventures overinvestment could result in excess supply which could cause significant decreases in our product prices significant excess obsolete inventory or inventory writedowns or underutilization charges and the potential impairment of our investments in flash ventures on the other hand if we or tmc underinvest in captive memory capacity or technology transitions if we grow capacity more slowly than the rest of the industry if our technology transitions do not occur on the timeline that we expect if we encounter unanticipated difficulties in implementing these transitions or if we implement technology transitions more slowly than our competitors we may not have enough captive supply of the right type of memory or at all to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis and we may lose opportunities for revenue gross margin and market share as a result if our flashbased memory supply is limited we may make strategic decisions with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers and these strategic allocation decisions may result in less favorable gross margin or damage certain customer relationships we are also contractually obligated to pay for 50 of the fixed costs of flash ventures regardless of whether we purchase any wafers from flash ventures furthermore purchase orders placed with flash ventures and under the foundry arrangements with tmc for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled therefore once our purchase decisions have been made our production costs for flash memory are fixed and we may be unable to reduce costs to match any subsequent declines in pricing or demand which would harm our gross margin our limited ability to react to fluctuations in flash memory supply and demand makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations 

under the terms of our venture agreements with tmc which govern the operations of flash ventures we have limited power to unilaterally direct most of the activities that most significantly impact flash ventures’ performance and we have limits to our ability to source or fabricate flashbased products outside of the flash ventures we may not always agree with tmc on our joint rd roadmap or expansions or conversions of production capacity in addition tmc’s shift in strategic priorities could adversely impact our business 

on june 1 2018 toshiba corporation announced it had completed the sale of tmc including its interests in flash ventures to a consortium led by sk hynix inc and bain capital the “bain consortium” that includes other competitors as well as key customers the sale of tmc to the bain consortium could lead to delays in decisionmaking disputes or changes in strategic direction that could adversely impact flash ventures andor adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition the bain consortium might not have the same interest that we do in protecting and growing flash ventures’ business and there may exist conflicts of interest between the bain consortium and flash ventures or us misalignment between us and tmc or the bain consortium on the strategic direction of flash ventures could adversely impact flash ventures’ ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancement andor our investment in flash ventures flash ventures’ competitiveness andor our investment in flash ventures could also be harmed by a mishandling or misuse of ip or other competitively sensitive confidential information regarding flash ventures such as its technology roadmap business or investment plans by a third party that might gain access to such information 

flash ventures requires significant investments by both tmc and us for technology transitions including the transition to 3d nand and capacity expansions the bain consortium has entered into financing agreements in connection with its purchase of tmc that could limit tmc’s ability to timely fund or finance investments in flash ventures or our joint development efforts as well as limit flash ventures’ ability to enter into lease financings to the extent that lease financings for flash ventures are not accessible on favorable terms or at all more cash would be required to fund investments if tmc does not or we do not provide sufficient resources or have adequate access to credit to timely fund investments in flash ventures our investments could be delayed or reduced delayed or reduced investment in manufacturing capacity or research and development by tmc or us could harm flash ventures’ competitiveness andor our investment in flash ventures in addition the financing arrangements that the bain consortium has entered into in connection with its purchase of tmc are secured by tmc’s equity interests in flash ventures permitting the lenders to foreclose on those equity interests under certain circumstances 

tmc has announced that it is starting construction of a new wafer fabrication facility for the manufacture of 3d nand in kitakami iwate japan although we intend to enter into agreements with tmc in due course to participate in the new kitakami facility there is no certainty as to when and on what terms we will do so if we are unable to extend our partnership with tmc to the kitakami facility on favorable terms our future supply of captive flashbased memory could be adversely impacted which could adversely affect our longterm business and financial results 

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to volatile demand declining average selling prices “asps” rapid technological change and industry consolidation all of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

demand for our devices software and solutions that we offer to our customers which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems including personal computers “pcs” and mobile devices manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period the prices of our products are influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand including the effects of new fab capacity in the industry macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors the price of nand flash memory is also influenced by conversion of industry dram capacity to nand and conversion of 2d nand capacity to 3d nand the storage market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and significant reductions in price if these price changes occur unnecessarily or in an unexpected manner there will likely be an adverse impact on our revenue and gross margins 

in addition we compete based on our ability to offer our customers competitive solutions that provide the most current and desired product and service features we expect that competition will continue to be intense and there is a risk that our competitors may be able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage over us which may allow their products to be less costly or enable them to provide better performance or to include additional features when compared to our products further some of our competitors may utilize certain pricing strategies including offering products at prices at or below cost that we may be unable to competitively match in addition the chinese government and various agencies stateowned or affiliated enterprises and investment funds are making significant investments to promote china’s domestic semiconductor industry consistent with the government’s stated national policy objectives if we are unable to effectively compete with any manufacturers located in china or nonchinese competitors benefitting from alliances with chinese companies in the markets where we compete our operating results and financial condition will suffer 

additionally some of our competitors offer products and technologies that we do not offer and may be able to use their broader product and technology portfolio to win sales from us our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of goods sold rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence finally the data storage industry as a whole has experienced consolidation over the past several years through acquisitions mergers and decisions by industry players to exit the industry further consolidation across the industry could enhance the capacity abilities and resources and lower the cost structure of some of our competitors causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage these factors along with others may also result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share all of which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

expansion into new markets may increase the complexity of our business and cause us to increase our rd expenses and investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

to remain a significant supplier in the storage industry and to expand into new markets we will need to offer a broader range of storage products to our customers as we expand our product lines to sell into new markets the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and we may become subject to different market dynamics these dynamics may include among other things different demand volume cyclicality seasonality product requirements sales channels and warranty and return policies in addition expansion into new markets may result in increases in rd expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability if we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors or new entrants who offer these products 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire or keep pace with asp reduction which could harm our operating results for example in transitioning our 2d nand manufacturing capacity to 3d nand technology we could experience delays or other challenges in the production ramp qualification of wafers shipment of samples to customers or customer approval process 3d nand and any new manufacturing node may be more susceptible to manufacturing yield issues manufacturing yield issues may not be identified during the development or production process or solved until an actual product is manufactured and tested further increasing our costs if our technology transitions including the production ramp of 3d nand technology take longer are more costly to complete than anticipated or do not improve manufacturing yield or other manufacturing efficiencies our flash memory costs may not remain competitive with other flashbased memory producers or may not fall commensurate with declines in the price of flashbased memory which would harm revenues our gross margin and operating results 

for additional technology transition risks related to 3d nand see the risk factors entitled “ we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba memory corporation “tmc” for the supply of flashbased memory and the development of flashbased technology which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results ” and “our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations” 

with respect to hdds we announced that we will use microwaveassisted magnetic recording mamr technology to increase hdd capacities if our hdd technology transitions including the production ramp of mamr hdds take longer or are more costly to complete than anticipated or if we otherwise fail to implement new hdd technologies successfully we may not remain competitive with other hdd producers which could adversely affect our revenues our gross margin and operating results 

moving to new technologies may require us to align to and build a new supply base our success in new product areas may be dependent in part on our ability to develop close relationships with new suppliers and on our ability to enter into favorable supply agreements where this cannot be done our business and operations may be adversely affected in addition if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting technologies to implement these new technologies are not available we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position 

the substitution or replacement of our technologies and products by new technologies could make our products obsolete and harm our operating results 

given the pace of technological development there is a possibility that new technologies could substitute for or replace our current technologies and products and make them obsolete historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in storage technologies or standards any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate or manufacture the new technology or standard fails to remain competitive 

there are some revolutionary technologies that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage including shingled magnetic recording energyassisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing 

many companies including some of our competitors have also developed or are attempting to develop alternative nonvolatile technologies including nonnand technologies such as magnetoresistive randomaccess memory mram resistive randomaccess memory reram and phase change memory pcm and nandbased vertical or stacked 3d memories based on charge trap floating gate and other cell architectures 

in addition a provider of processors and nonvolatile memory solutions may be developing a new standard to attach ultralow latency nonvolatile memory to its processor memory bus which it may choose not to license to its competitors resulting in it being a single source provider of such nonvolatile memory solutions as a result of these shifts in technology and standards we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as recording heads magnetic media and tools in adopting new standards or in investing in different capital equipment or manufacturing processes to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or standards or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies or standards we may not be able to offer products with capacities and capabilities that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

if we do not properly manage new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with technology advancements and compete with alternative storage technologies if our products fail to offer a superior value proposition to alternative storage products we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our business will suffer as we introduce new products standards or technologies it can take time for these new standards or technologies to be adopted for customers to accept and transition to these new standards or technologies and for significant sales to be generated if at all failure of our customers to adopt our new products standards or technologies could harm our results of operations as we fail to reap the benefits of our investments 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have entered into strategic relationships with various partners for future product development sales growth and the supply of technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing including our partnership with tmc for flashbased memory development and manufacturing see the risk factor entitled “ because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers a disruption in our supply chain including a shortage in supply or a supplier’s failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us or supplier consolidation could adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results ” for a further description of the risks associated with our reliance on external suppliers these strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations and financial condition these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our strategic relationships are unsuccessful or there are unanticipated changes in or termination of our strategic relationships our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers a disruption in our supply chain including a shortage in supply or a supplier’s failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us or supplier consolidation could adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results  

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware preamps controller components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing chip assembly product assembly and product testing and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our justintime hubs distribution centers and freight from suppliers to our factories and from our factories to our customers throughout the world many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products technology and equipment 

from time to time our suppliers have experienced difficulty meeting our requirements if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers we may not be able to meet demand for our products delays or cost increases experienced by our suppliers in developing or sourcing materials and components for use in our products or incompatibility or quality issues relating to our products could also harm our financial results as well as business relationships with our customers we do not have longterm contracts with some of our existing suppliers nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers and therefore we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our products any significant problems that occur at our suppliers or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems either of which would harm our operating results and financial condition in addition if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers we may not be able to engage alternative suppliers who are able or willing to provide goods or services in sufficient quantities or at a cost acceptable to us 

  

in addition our supply base has experienced industry consolidation our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors consolidate decide to exit the industry or redirect their investments and increase costs to us each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition some of our suppliers have experienced a decline in financial performance where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation or a decline in financial performance is enhanced some of our suppliers may also be competitors in other areas of our business which could lead to difficulties in price negotiations or meeting our supply requirements any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results 

see the risk factors entitled “we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba memory corporation “tmc” for the supply of flashbased memory and the development of flashbased technology which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results” and “our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations” for additional risks related to our supply of flash memory and our strategic relationships 

price volatility shortages of critical materials or components or use by other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry or contractual commitments we enter into with suppliers to reduce the risk of component shortages could increase our costs and may negatively impact our operating results 

increases in the cost for certain critical materials and components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting our products and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers shortages of critical components such as dram flashbased memory and multilayer ceramic capacitors mlcc or materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations such as the recently announced trade and tariff actions quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components and may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory which could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our operating results 

the loss of our key executive management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees including employees from acquisitions and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted we may be at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees versus other companies that may pay a relatively higher portion of fixed salary if we lose our existing key management staff or skilled employees or are unable to hire and integrate new key management staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key management or staff our operating results would likely be harmed furthermore if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our intended realignment after we make decisions regarding our personnel and implement our realignment plans our operating results could be adversely affected 

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the current concentration of flash ventures in yokkaichi japan magnifies the risks of supply disruption the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as a power outage political instability civil unrest localized labor unrest or other employment issues or a localized health risk that adversely affects any of these facilities or the employees or logistics operators at these facilities would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results in addition the geographic concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from any of these problems a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

we may incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the scope of the coverage of our insurance policies there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially due to market availability pricing or other reasons we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some cases no coverage at all for natural disasters and environmental damages as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost we depend upon tmc to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash ventures if tmc fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses and such failure could also cause flash ventures to breach various financing covenants 

manufacturing marketing and selling our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

currently a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and many of our products and components are produced overseas our revenue and future growth is significantly dependent on the growth of international markets and we may face difficulties in entering or maintaining international sales markets we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing and sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of and reliance on contract manufacturers including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of these risks our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected some of these risks such as trade restrictions higher tariffs and fees import and export restrictions or loss of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities could increase as a result of changes to policies rules and regulations for example beginning in early 2018 the us commenced certain trade actions including proposed new and increased tariffs on an evolving list of imported materials and products countries have responded to these actions in various ways including proposed tariff increases on products imported from the us we cannot predict whether or to what extent there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether tariffs or other restrictions may be changed or imposed on our products or our supply chain such tariffs policy or regulatory changes or other trade restrictions could increase our cost of doing business our ability to sell to certain customers and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we experience sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

sales of computer systems mobile devices storage subsystems gaming consoles and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions which are a key part of our growth strategy it may adversely affect our future results 

we seek to be an industryleading developer manufacturer and provider of innovative storage solutions balancing our core hard drive and flash memory business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions we are also subject to certain covenants in our debt agreements that place limits on our ability to complete acquisitions and investments even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition or changes in technology development and related roadmaps following an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition acquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our shareholders and the issuance of additional indebtedness that would put additional pressure on liquidity furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest with or in certain other countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so including investments in joint ventures minority investments and outbound technology transfers to certain countries 

any cost savings initiatives or restructurings that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect which may adversely affect our business 

from time to time we engage in cost savings initiatives and restructurings that may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our manufacturing or other facilities as a result of any cost savings initiatives or restructurings we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods these actions could also impact employee retention in addition we cannot be sure that these actions will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or consolidations if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses our operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in demand for our products changes in product life cycles and the failure to qualify our products and achieve design wins with our customers could adversely affect our sales margins asps and our ability to recover the cost of product development 

events or circumstances that impact demand in the markets for our products or our inability to address that demand successfully could materially adversely impact our operating results for example demand for our products may be affected by among other factors the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are not able to respond to these or other events or circumstances that impact demand for our products it could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied by competing storage technologies thereby decreasing our sales as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to the demand for storage our sales asps and gross margin could decline which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

product life cycles may lengthen or shorten both of which could adversely affect gross margins or our ability to recover the cost of product development 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers and the product qualification process may be lengthy for some customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced even if our products meet customer specifications our sales to these customers are dependent upon the customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products in sufficient volume our ability to supply our products in sufficient quantity and in a timely manner and with respect to oem partners the oems’ ability to create market and successfully sell products containing our solutions 

our high level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

as of june 29 2018  our total indebtedness was 1138 billion  in aggregate principal and we had 175 billion  of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to meet the debt service obligations contained in our debt agreements will depend on our available cash and our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors our bank debt also contains a variable interest rate component based on our corporate credit ratings which could result in increased interest rates and debt service obligations if our ratings were to decline if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or should we fail to comply with our financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness causing an event of default under the applicable indebtedness the debt holders could accelerate the related debt and that may result in the crossacceleration or crossdefault of other debt leases or other obligations if we are required to repay our indebtedness before the applicable due dates we may not have sufficient funds available and we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities which we may be unable to do on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs 

in addition to our credit ratings impacting the interest rate on our current debt our ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

we may from time to time seek to further refinance our substantial indebtedness by issuing additional shares of our common stock in one or more securities offerings these securities offerings may dilute our existing shareholders reduce the value of our common stock or both because our decision to issue securities will depend on among other things market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future securities offerings thus holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings diluting and potentially reducing the value of our common stock 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states of america signed the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” which includes a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses including a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings the 2017 act significantly impacts our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 as a result of the deemed repatriation tax and may impact several other elements of our operating model in future years certain additional provisions of the 2017 act such as the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings will also apply to us and as a result we generally expect our effective tax rate to increase from the fiscal year 2018 rate excluding the mandatory deemed repatriation tax and the remeasurement of deferred taxes taxes due over a period of time as a result of the 2017 act could be accelerated upon certain triggering events including failure to pay such taxes when due the 2017 act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code and we expect to see future regulatory administrative or legislative guidance we are analyzing the 2017 act to determine the full impact of the new tax law and to the extent any future guidance differs from our preliminary interpretation of the law it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

in addition many countries in the european union and around the globe have adopted andor proposed changes to current tax laws further organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with loss or nonrenewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met we may not be able to meet such conditions if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax examinations or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received a statutory notice of deficiency seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 13 income tax expense benefit  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems security vulnerabilities or design defects or sustain system failures our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors service providers cloud solution providers and partners may also experience such attacks cyber attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws bugs security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage in some instances efforts to correct vulnerabilities or prevent attacks may reduce the performance of our computer systems and networks which could negatively impact our business we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities our products are also targets for cyber attacks including those products utilized in cloudbased environments as well as our cloud service offerings while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers we have agreed with certain customers and strategic partners including tmc to undertake certain commitments to promote information security and we may be liable to tmc or such other parties if we fail to meet our cyber security commitments 

in addition our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures further our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result we could experience additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

sales in the distribution channel and to the retail market are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes within these markets or maintain and grow our applicable market share our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances 

a significant portion of our sales is also made through retailers our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple retail market channels particularly in the retail market adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors if customers no longer maintain a preference for our product brands or if our retailers are not successful in selling our products our operating results may be adversely affected 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the year ended june 29 2018  42  of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results and financial condition would likely be harmed 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products increased customer pressure on our prices replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as mobile social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

we make significant investments in rd to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments or investments that are not cost effective could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we make significant rd investments to maintain our existing products and to lead innovation and development of new technologies in addition we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model in order to remain competitive the challenges of reducing operating costs could result in more costly capital expenditures that reduce the cost benefits of technology transitions and could limit our ability to keep pace with reductions in asps our rd investments may not result in viable technologies or products and even if they do result in viable technologies or products they may not be profitable or accepted by the market in addition if we are not able to improve our technology or develop new technologies at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to incur additional costs to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely significant investments in unsuccessful or costineffective rd efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

we are subject to risks related to product defects or the unintended use or security breaches of our products which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated litigation or indemnification claims 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition product defects product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships lost revenue indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products warranty claims litigation or loss of market share with our customers including our oem and original design manufacturers “odm” customers our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provision do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

certain of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third party content and usergenerated data stored on our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by hurting our reputation requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects and expose us to litigation and indemnification claims 

in addition thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate or use in our products may contain defects in design or manufacturing that could unexpectedly result in epidemic failures security vulnerabilities or performance issues and subject us to liability 

we and certain of our officers are at times involved in litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which may be costly may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings fines or penalties which could materially harm our business 

we are involved in litigation including cases involving our ip rights and those of others antitrust and commercial matters putative securities class action suits and other actions we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others some of the actions seek injunctive relief including injunctions against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results from time to time we may also be the subject of inquiries requests for information investigations and actions by government and regulatory agencies regarding our businesses any such matters could result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including fines penalties or restrictions on our business activities 

litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations in the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation investigation or governmental proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities including the manufacture use and sale of products with or without merit such matters can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by us could also result in counterclaims against us which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us in addition litigation investigations or governmental proceedings and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel and may also harm the market prices of our securities 

we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation investigations or governmental proceedings these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits the cost of governmental law enforcement or regulatory investigations or proceedings civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measures if any which may be imposed 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use sharing and security of thirdparty data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm  

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data and employee data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other ip rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we have historically been involved in frequent disputes regarding patent and other ip rights and we have in the past received and we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other ip rights we may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license ip to others ip risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no ip protection as a defense against litigation the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of ip litigation increase the ip risks we face litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may be subject to injunctions enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

if we incorporate thirdparty technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the ip of others we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier customer or partner could negatively impact our business 

moreover from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged ip infringement the scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses including attorneys’ fees we may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

our reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable ip such as our process technology we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes there can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us it is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection there are entities whom we believe may infringe our ip enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our ip to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered ip rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

the success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands we believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products any occurrence of counterfeiting imitation or confusion with our brands could adversely affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands which in turn could negatively impact sales of our branded products our share and our gross margin as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution 

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health safety data privacy anticorruption and tax regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the responsible business alliance “rba” could cause an increase in our operating costs 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health safety data privacy anticorruption and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our suppliers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which would have a materially adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the rba the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers customers or partners could harm our business 

we expect our suppliers customers and partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers customers partners or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of them or divergence of their business practices from those generally accepted as ethical could harm our business by interrupting or otherwise disrupting the shipment of our product components damaging our reputation forcing us to find alternate component sources reducing demand for our products for example through a consumer boycott or exposing us to potential liability for our suppliers’ customers’ or partners’ wrongdoings 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply excess inventory and price decreases which could impact our sales asps and gross margin thereby adversely affecting our operating results and our financial condition if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

our vertical integration of some of our products makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop products with leading technology and overall quality increasing capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks for our business 

we develop flashbased memory as well as other nonvolatile memory technology through our partnership with tmc we are also vertically integrated in a substantial portion of the recording heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we produce consequently for some of our products we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of technologies developed by other manufacturers since we may not have access to alternative technologies that we do not develop internally we may have to pay royalties in order to access those technologies 

in addition we may be unsuccessful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the products we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop products with leading technology and overall quality continuing the cost reductions necessary to maintain adequate gross margin and our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

further as a result of our vertical integration of some of our products we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales some of our assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves in addition as a result of adverse labor rates or availability we may be required to increase investments in automation which may cause our capital expenditures to increase if we do not adequately address these challenges our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created and may continue to create uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we our suppliers or our customers operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs future acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities rd activities including our operations in israel or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected any of these events could also increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could have a negative effect on our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers or adversely affect consumer confidence 

sudden disruptions to the availability of air transportation or ocean or land freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of air transportation cargo operations or ocean rail or truck freight lanes caused by among other things labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently receive shipments from our suppliers or deliver our products 

our license and royalty revenue may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future due to license agreement expirations or renewals declines in sales of the products or use of technology underlying the license and royalty revenue by our licensees or if licensees fail to perform on a portion or all of their contractual obligations 

if our existing licensees do not renew their licenses upon expiration renew or sign new agreements on less favorable terms exercise their option to terminate the license or fail to exercise their option to extend the licenses or we are not successful in signing new licensees in the future our license revenue profitability and cash provided by operating activities would be harmed and we may incur significant patent litigation costs to enforce our patents against these licensees as our older patents expire and the coverage of our newer patents may be different it may be more difficult to negotiate or renew favorable license agreement terms or a license agreement at all our agreements may require us in certain instances to recognize license revenue related to a particular licensee all in one period instead of over time which could create additional volatility in our licensing revenue a portion of our license and royalty revenue is based on sales of product categories as well as the underlying technology and fluctuations in the sales of those products or technology adoption rates would also result in fluctuations in the license and royalty revenue due to us under our agreements if our licensees or we fail to perform on contractual obligations we may incur costs to enforce or defend the terms of our licenses and there can be no assurance that our enforcement defense or collection efforts will be effective if we license new ip from third parties or existing licensees we may be required to pay license fees royalty payments or offset existing license revenue we may enter into agreements with customers suppliers or partners that could limit our ability to monetize our ip or could result in us being required to provide ip indemnification to our customers suppliers or partners in addition we may be subject to disputes claims or other disagreements on the timing amount or collection of royalties or license payments under our license agreements 

flash ventures’ equipment lease agreements contain covenants and other cancellation events and cancellation of the leases would harm our business operating results and financial condition 

flash ventures sells to and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions “lessors” a portion of its equipment and flash ventures has entered into equipment lease agreements most of which we and tmc each guarantee half of the total outstanding obligations and some of which we guarantee in full for our share of the flash ventures investment as of june 29 2018  the portion of outstanding flash ventures’ lease obligations covered by our guarantees totaled approximately 122 billion  based upon the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate at june 29 2018  the equipment lease agreements contain covenants and cancellation events that are customary for japanese lease facilities and that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors cancellation events relating to the guarantors include among other things an assignment of all or a substantial part of a guarantor’s business a bankruptcy event involving a guarantor and acceleration of other monetary debts of a guarantor above a specified threshold 

the breach of a covenant or the occurrence of another cancellation event could result in an acceleration of the flash ventures’ lease obligations if a cancellation event were to occur flash ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the lessors as well as other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us as guarantor increased interest rates or waiver fees if a cancellation event occurs and we fail to reach a resolution we may be required to pay all or a portion of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 

any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or to reduce or discontinue repurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time in addition we may reduce or discontinue repurchases of shares of our common stock as we deem appropriate and as market conditions allow any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of shares of our common stock are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue cost of goods sold margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin in addition our purchases of flashbased memory from flash ventures and our investment in flash ventures are denominated in japanese yen if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar our cost of purchasing flashbased memory wafers and the cost to us of future capital funding of flash ventures would increase which could negatively impact our operating results if any of these events occur they would have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the us therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the us fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the us 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place thus our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and harm our operating results further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions operating losses third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales may occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

our cash balances and investment portfolio are subject to various risks any of which could adversely impact our financial position 

given the international footprint of our business we have both domestic and international cash balances and investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings security types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market political sovereign and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a material part of our investment portfolio consists of investment grade corporate securities bank deposits asset backed securities and us government and agency securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that our investments may experience an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed federal deposit insurance corporation fdic limits could also have an adverse impact on our financial position 

in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to repay our indebtedness fund acquisitions pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock we may choose or be required to increase our borrowings if available or to repatriate funds to the us at an additional tax cost we must comply with regulations regarding the conversion and distribution of funds earned in the local currencies of various countries if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in these countries

closure of foreign manufacturing facility 

in july 2018 we announced the closing of our manufacturing facility in kuala lumpur malaysia in order to reduce manufacturing costs and consolidate hard disk drive “hdd” operations into thailand we expect the closure to be substantially completed by the end of the calendar year 2019 and to result in total pretax charges of approximately 160 million  these charges are expected to consist of approximately 85 million  in employee termination benefits and 75 million  in assetrelated contract termination and other charges during the year ended june 29 2018  we recognized 56 million  in employee termination benefits within employee termination asset impairment and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations for additional information see part ii item 8 note 15  employee termination asset impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k  

results of operations 

summary comparison of 2018  2017  and 2016 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our   consolidated statements of operations by dollars and percentage of net revenue 1  





 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding net revenues by geography and end market 



for each of 2018  2017  and 2016  no single customer accounted for 10  or more of our net revenue for 2018  2017  and 2016  our top 10 customers accounted for 42  36  and 43  of our net revenue respectively 

fiscal year 2018  net revenue and gross margin compared to fiscal year 2017  net revenue and gross margin 

net revenue net revenue increased 155 billion  or 8  in 2018  compared to 2017  driven by increases in all end markets client devices revenue for the year ended june 29 2018  increased 6  year over year primarily driven by growth in embedded flash products offset by client compute hdd devices our revenue for data center devices and solutions for the year ended june 29 2018  increased 10  year over year driven primarily by a significant increase in sales from our capacity enterprise hdd partially offset by our expected lower sales of performance enterprise hdds client solutions revenue for the year ended june 29 2018  increased 10  year over year reflecting growth in both retail flash and hdd products 

changes in the net revenue by geography generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2018  2017  and 2016  these programs represented 12  12  and 13  of gross revenues respectively the amounts attributed to our sales incentive and marketing programs generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions list pricing strategies seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue 

gross profit and gross margin gross profit increased 163 billion  or 27  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to the increase in revenue and improvement in our gross margin the improvement in our gross margin for the year ended june 29 2018  was primarily due to a favorable demand environment for flashbased products a higher mix of revenue from sales of flashbased products and capacity enterprise devices and improvements in our production costs from technology transitions in addition gross profit was impacted by amortization expense on acquired intangible assets stockbased compensation charges related to the implementation of costsaving initiatives and other charges which aggregated 106 billion  or 52  of revenue in 2018  compared to 114 billion  or 60  of revenue in 2017  

the flash industry is characterized by cyclicality as it responds to variations in customers’ demand for products and expands or manages production capacity to meet that demand the favorable demand environment for flashbased products experienced by the industry for the last several quarters is beginning to normalize as technology conversions are maturing and manufacturing yields are improving thus increasing flash supply as a result we expect our gross margins to decline in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  due to expected declines in the average selling price per gigabyte of flash memory as supply grows to meet demand 

fiscal year 2017  net revenue and gross margin compared to fiscal year 2016  net revenue and gross margin 

net revenue net revenue increased 610 billion  or 47  as compared to 2016  primarily due to a full year of revenue from the sale of flashbased products following the acquisition of sandisk corporation “sandisk” in may 2016 the “merger” compared to a partial year of such revenue in the prior year this increase was partially offset by lower revenue related to lower pc and enterprise hdd shipments changes in the mix of net revenue by end market for 2017  as compared to 2016  reflect the full year increase in revenues from the merger which has resulted in comparatively higher revenue in client devices and client solutions than our preacquisition business 

changes in the mix of net revenue by geography for 2017  as compared to 2016  reflect the additional revenues from the merger which has resulted in comparatively higher revenue in asia than our preacquisition business 

gross profit and gross margin gross profit increased 264 billion  or 77  in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to the increase in revenue mentioned above in addition gross profit for 2017  was impacted by amortization expense on acquired intangible assets charges related to the implementation of costsaving initiatives stockbased compensation and acquisition related charges which aggregated 114 billion  or 60  of revenue for 2017  and 375 million  or 29  of revenue for 2016  gross margin increased to 318  for 2017  as compared to 264  for 2016  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to sales of flashbased products following the merger as such products have comparatively higher gross margins than our preacquisition products cost improvements across all products driven by manufacturing integration activities and cost improvements as flashbased technology transitions to more cost efficient designs 

operating expenses 

fiscal year 2018  operating expenses compared to fiscal year 2017  operating expenses 

research and development “rd” expense decreased 41 million  or 2  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to our cost saving initiatives and lower variable compensation expense partially offset by further investments in flash technologies in addition fiscal year 2018  included aggregate charges of 179 million  related to stockbased compensation expenses charges related to the implementation of costsaving initiatives acquisitionrelated charges and other charges compared to 199 million  in 2017  

selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased 28 million  or 2  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to operating expenses from recent acquisitions and higher consulting services partially offset by lower variable compensation expense and lower charges related to stockbased compensation expenses amortization expense on acquired intangible assets charges related to the implementation of costsaving initiatives acquisitionrelated charges and other charges aggregating to 340 million  in 2018  compared to 404 million  in 2017  

employee termination asset impairment and other charges was 215 million  in 2018  a decrease  of 17 million  or 7  from 2017  the decrease is related to our progress toward completion of our integration restructuring plan partially offset by the announced closure of our foreign manufacturing facility for additional information regarding employee termination asset impairment and other charges see part ii item 8 note 15  employee termination asset impairment and other charges  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

fiscal year 2017  operating expenses compared to fiscal year 2016  operating expenses 

rd expense increased 814 million  or 50  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to the merger and continued development of flashbased technology fiscal year 2017  also included aggregate charges of 199 million  related to stockbased compensation expenses charges related to the implementation of costsaving initiatives acquisitionrelated charges and other discrete charges compared to 106 million  in 2016  related to such charges 

sga expense increased 448 million  or 45  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to the merger fiscal year 2017  also included aggregate charges of 404 million  related to stockbased compensation expenses amortization expense on acquired intangible assets charges related to the implementation of costsaving initiatives acquisitionrelated charges and other discrete charges compared to 379 million  in 2016  related to such charges 

employee termination asset impairment and other charges was 232 million  in 2017  a decrease  of 113 million  or 33  from 2016  these charges in 2017 primarily related to further actions under the restructuring plan 2016 associated with the integration and business realignment of substantial portions of our business for additional information regarding employee termination asset impairment and other charges see part ii item 8 note 15  employee termination asset impairment and other charges  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

interest and other income expense   

fiscal year 2018  interest and other expense net compared to fiscal year 2017  interest and other expense net 

total interest and other expense net  increased 347 million  in 2018  primarily due to losses on extinguishment of debt of 899 million  in 2018  compared to 274 million  in 2017  these losses were partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from reductions in the principal amount of debt and lower interest rates lower impairment charges related to our costmethod investments and higher interest income due to increased rates of return on investment for additional information see part ii item 8 note 6  debt  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  and impairment charges related to our costmethod investments 

fiscal year 2017  interest and other expense net compared to fiscal year 2016  interest and other expense net 

total interest and other expense net  increased 872 million  in 2017  primarily due to a full year of interest expense in 2017   resulting from the additional debt issued in connection with the merger compared to only a partial year of such expense in 2016  as well as losses on the settlements of certain of our term loans and impairment charges related to our costmethod investments 

income tax expense benefit 

the following table sets forth income tax information from our consolidated statement of operations by dollar and effective tax rate 



under the 2017 act  the us federal corporate tax rate is reduced from 35  to 21  and is effective january 1 2018  resulting in the use of an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 28  for our us federal corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2018  for fiscal year 2019 and beyond we will utilize the enacted us federal corporate tax rate of 21  

consistent with applicable securities and exchange commission “sec” guidance we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax required by the 2017 act and have recognized a provisional income tax expense of 157 billion  for the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax and a provisional income tax benefit of 65 million  related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended june 29 2018  for other elements of tax expense noted in part ii item 8 note 13  income tax expense benefit  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  or where we have not made an election we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continue to account for such items based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the 2017 act as we finalize the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 act during a oneyear measurement period permitted by applicable sec guidance we expect to reflect adjustments to the recorded provisional amounts and record additional tax effects of the 2017 act 

the primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended june 29 2018  and the blended us federal statutory rate of 28  are provisional taxes recognized as a result of the 2017 act and an increase to the valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards from restructuring activities which are partially offset by the 2018  generation of tax credits and tax holidays in malaysia philippines singapore and thailand that expired or will expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030 

the primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended june 30 2017  and the us federal statutory rate of 35  are taxes related to the integration of sandisk and an increase in the valuation allowance for both acquired tax attributes and net operating loss carryforwards from restructuring activities which are partially offset by the 2017  generation of tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower rates due primarily to tax holidays in malaysia philippines singapore and thailand 

the primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the year ended july 1 2016  and the us federal statutory rate of 35  are the 2016  generation of tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower rates due primarily to tax holidays in malaysia philippines singapore and thailand 

the 2017 act  is expected to have an unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018   due to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax offset in part by the remeasurement of deferred taxes and the reduction in the corporate tax rate in future years certain additional provisions of the 2017 act  such as a minimum tax on foreign earnings will also apply to us and as a result we generally expect our effective tax rate to increase from the rate expected for fiscal year 2018 excluding the mandatory deemed repatriation tax and the remeasurement of deferred taxes our estimate of the effective tax rate increase is subject to our assertion as to whether foreign undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested and to other calculations and elections during the measurement period our total tax expense in future fiscal years will also vary as a result of discrete items such as excess tax benefits or deficiencies 

for additional information regarding income tax expense benefit see part ii item 8 note 13  income tax expense benefit  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows 



we believe our cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt stock repurchases dividend and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in part i item 1a risk factors  in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

during 2019 we expect cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable and equity investments relating to our flash ventures joint venture with toshiba memory corporation to be approximately 150 billion  to 190 billion  the total expected cash to be used could vary depending on the timing and completion of various capital projects and the availability timing and terms of related financing 

pursuant to the 2017 act  we are required to pay a onetime deemed repatriation tax related to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for 2018  we recorded a provisional amount for the mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability of 157 billion  which is payable over an 8 year period as further discussed below under “short and longterm liquiditycontractual obligations and commitments” the provisional amount included in the consolidated financial statements may change when we finalize the calculation of our post1986 foreign earnings and profits that were previously deferred from us income taxes and the amount of foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets for additional information regarding our total tax liability for the mandatory repatriation tax see part ii item 8 note 13  income tax expense benefit  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

a total of 415 billion  and 499 billion  of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the us as of june 29 2018  and june 30 2017  respectively although the mandatory deemed repatriation tax has removed us federal taxes on distributions to the us we continue to evaluate the expected manner of recovery to determine whether or not to continue to assert indefinite reinvestment on a part or all the foreign undistributed earnings this requires us to reevaluate the existing short and longterm capital allocation policies in light of the 2017 act  and calculate the tax cost that is incremental to the us deemed repatriation tax eg foreign withholding state income taxes and additional us tax on currency transaction gains or losses of repatriating cash to the us while the current tax expense is based upon an assumption that foreign undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested our plan may change upon the completion of longterm capital allocation plans in light of the 2017 act  and completion of the calculation of the incremental tax effects on the repatriation of foreign undistributed earnings in the event we determine not to continue to assert the permanent reinvestment of part or all of our foreign undistributed earnings such a determination could result in the accrual and payment of additional federal foreign state and local taxes 

operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus changes in other operating assets and liabilities this represents our principal source of cash net cash provided by  changes in other operating assets and liabilities was 486 million  for 2018  as compared to net cash provided by  changes in other operating assets and liabilities of 91 million  for 2017  the increase in cash provided by changes in other operating assets and liabilities in 2018  primarily reflects the payable recorded for the mandatory repatriation tax as described in the tax reform section of key developments above changes in our other operating assets and liabilities are also largely affected by our working capital requirements which are dependent on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle our cash conversion cycle measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the cash conversion cycles were as follows 



changes in days sales outstanding “dsos” are generally due to the linearity of shipments changes in days in inventory “dios” are generally related to the timing of inventory builds changes in days payables outstanding “dpos” are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

for 2018  dso increased by 2 days over the prior year primarily reflecting the timing of shipments and customer receipts dio increased  by 18 days over the prior year primarily reflecting increases in flash inventory and an increase in hdd inventory due to ongoing hard drive manufacturing transformation activities the decrease in dpo primarily reflects the increased production volume and timing of vendor payments 

the working capital metrics in 2016  were notably impacted by the inclusion of sandisk’s accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable balances as of july 1 2016  but only including sandisk’s revenue and cost of sales following the merger the merger inflated dso dio and dpo by 12 days 32 days and 14 days respectively excluding the impact of the merger in 2016  dso in 2017 increased by 8 days over 2016  primarily reflecting timing of customer receipts in the prior year excluding the impact of the merger in 2016  dio in 2017  increased by 16 days over 2016  the increase in dio primarily reflects shortterm buildup of inventory to maintain supply as we close certain facilities and transition production excluding the impact of the merger in 2016  dpo in 2017  increased by 2 days over 2016  primarily reflecting routine variations in timing of purchases and payments during the period 

investing activities 

during 2018  net cash used in  investing activities primarily consisted of 835 million  of capital expenditures a net 742 million  increase in notes receivable issuances to flash ventures to fund its capital expansion and 100 million  for acquisitions net cash used in investing activities for 2017  primarily consisted of 578 million  of capital expenditures and a 277 million  net increase in notes receivable issuances to and investments in flash ventures partially offset by a net reduction of our available for sale securities of 230 million  during 2016  net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of 984 billion  related to the merger net of cash acquired 584 million  of capital expenditures 90 million  net increase in notes receivable to flash ventures and a net 76 million  of other investing activities partially offset by 977 million  of proceeds from a net decrease in investments and sales of marketable securities 

our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds that invest in us treasury securities and us government agency securities as well as bank certificates of deposit in addition we invest directly in us treasury securities us and international government agency securities certificates of deposit assetbacked securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds 

financing activities

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 note 2  recent accounting pronouncements  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to consolidated financial statements  may be material 

revenue 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions andor a right of return and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection andor returns until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information historical and anticipated returns information and customer claim processing if customer demand for our products or market conditions differ from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 12  to 13  of gross revenue and adjustments to revenue due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenue reported in prior periods have generally averaged less than 1 of gross revenue over the last three fiscal years 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates for additional information see part ii item 8 note 16  legal proceedings  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired and whether a quantitative test for impairment is considered necessary if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to perform a quantitative approach to determine the amount of impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit if our stock price decreases significantly goodwill could become impaired which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations 

inprocess research and development “iprd” is an intangible asset accounted as an indefinitelived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated rd effort during the development period we conduct an iprd impairment test annually and whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the iprd is impaired events which might indicate impairment include but are not limited to adverse cost factors strategic decisions made in response to economic market and competitive conditions   the impact of the economic environment on us and our customer base if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

other longlived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for product costs and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months  we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes for additional information see part ii item 8 note 4  fair value measurements and investments  and note 5  derivative instruments and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form 10‑k 

as of june 29 2018  we had outstanding the foreign exchange contracts presented in the following table the designated foreign exchange contracts are entered to protect the us dollar value of our product cost and operating expenses changes in fair values of the nondesignated foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income expense net and are largely offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 







 

during 2018  2017  and 2016  total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements  

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

disclosure about other market risks 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under our revolving facility and term loan a1 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted london interbank offered rate “libor” subject to a 00  floor plus an applicable margin varying from 1125  to 2000  or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0125  to 1000  in each case depending on our corporate credit ratings as of june 29 2018  the applicable margin based on our current credit ratings was 15  borrowings under our us term loan b4 bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor subject to a 00  floor plus a margin of 175  or a base rate plus a margin of 075  

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt at june 29 2018  70  of the par value of our debt was at variable rates we entered into payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively converts 100 billion  of our term loans to fixed rates through may 2020 and an incremental 100 billion  through april 2023 as of june 29 2018  we had 794 billion  of variable rate debt after giving effect to the 200 billion  of interest rate swaps we effectively had 594 billion  of longterm debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by 59 million

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by sec rule 13a‑15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a‑15f and 15d‑15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013  based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see report of independent registered public accounting firm herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 29 2018  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we are implementing an enterprise resource planning “erp” system on a worldwide basis which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes the gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years we have completed the implementation of certain processes including the financial consolidation and reporting and supplier management processes and have revised and updated the related controls these changes did not materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as we implement the remaining functionality under this erp system over the next several years we will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

technology 

rotating magnetic storage 

hdds provide nonvolatile data storage based on the recording of magnetic information on a rotating disk we have successfully developed and commercialized hdds that operate in an enclosed helium environment instead of air delivering industry leading hdd capacity and performance attributes our improvements in hdd capacity which lower product costs over time have been enabled largely through advancements in recording head and magnetic media technology we develop and manufacture substantially all of the recording heads and magnetic media used in our hard drive products we invest considerable resources in rd manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment for recording head and media technology as well as in other aspects of the magnetic recording system such as hdd mechanics controller and firmware technology in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

solid state storage 

solid state storage products provide nonvolatile storage based on nandflash technology we develop and manufacture solid state storage products in different form factors for a variety of different markets including enterprise or cloud storage client storage automotive mobile devices and removable memory devices 

our solid state storage products utilize our captive nandflash technology which we develop and manufacture through our business ventures with toshiba we focus significant research development and effort on developing highly reliable highperformance costeffective nandflash technology over time we have successfully developed and commercialized an increased number of bits per cell in an increasingly smaller form factor further driving cost reductions 

in 2017 we achieved major milestones in nandflash technology we have 

 

 

 

we expect to develop and commercialize additional generations of 3d nand technologies over the next several years while continuing to utilize our older technology for certain markets and applications 

we are leveraging our expertise resources and strategic investments in nonvolatile memories to explore a wide spectrum of persistent memory and storage class memory technologies we have also initiated defined and developed standards to meet new market needs and to promote wide acceptance of flash storage standards through interoperability and easeofuse 

our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner rd expenses totaled 244 billion  163 billion  and 165 billion  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyright and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our ip rights 

we have more than 14000  active patents worldwide and have many patent applications in process we continually seek additional united states “us” and international patents on our technology we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products also depends upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for cannot alone ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented ip particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the laws of the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own ip portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and to grow our manufacturing operations as necessary we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our production of hdd and nandflash products are highvolume and utilization lowcost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity 

hdd and nandflash product manufacturing are complex processes involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and rigorous testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

a majority of our nandflash supply requirements for our nandflash products is obtained from our business ventures with toshiba which provide us with leadingedge highquality and lowcost nandflash memory wafers this represents a captive supply and we are obligated to take our share of the output from these ventures or pay the fixed costs associated with that capacity see “ventures with toshiba” below for additional information while a majority of our flash memory supply utilized for our products is purchased from these ventures from timetotime we also purchase flash memory from other nandflash manufacturers which we refer to as noncaptive while we do not unilaterally control the operations of these ventures we believe that our business venture relationship with toshiba helps us to reduce the costs of producing our products increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers our vertically integrated manufacturing operations for our nandflash products are concentrated in three locations with our business ventures with toshiba located in yokkaichi japan and our inhouse assembly and test operations located in shanghai china and penang malaysia 

we also leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

materials and supplies 

hdd primarily consists of recording heads magnetic media and a printed circuit board assembly we design and manufacture substantially all of the recording heads and magnetic media required for our products as a result we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less reliant on recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers we depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our hdd product design and manufacturing 

our nandflash product consists of nandflash memory and controllers a majority of our nandflash memory is primarily supplied by our business ventures with toshiba controllers are primarily designed inhouse and manufactured by thirdparty foundries or acquired from thirdparty suppliers we believe the use of our inhouse assembly and test facilities as well as contract manufacturers provides flexibility and gives us access to increased production capacity we have developed deep relationships with these vendors and toshiba to establish continuous supply of nandflash memory and controllers 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for our component requirements but in some instances use sole or single sources for business or technology reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

ventures with toshiba   

we and toshiba currently operate three business ventures in 300millimeter nandflash manufacturing facilities in yokkaichi japan which provide us leadingedge costcompetitive nandflash memory wafers for our end products through flash partners ltd flash alliance ltd and flash forward ltd which we collectively refer to as flash ventures we and toshiba collaborate in the development and manufacture of nandflash memory wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the flash venture entities we hold a 499 ownership position in each of the flash venture entities each flash venture entity purchases wafers from toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup we are obligated to purchase half of flash ventures’ nandflash memory wafer supply or pay for half of flash ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase we are also obligated to fund 499 to 50 of flash ventures’ investments to the extent that flash ventures’ operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments we and toshiba also collaborate on certain rd activities in support of flash ventures 

the agreements governing the operations of the flash venture entities also set out a framework for any investment by the joint venture partners in nand manufacturing capacity we have a facility agreement with toshiba related to the construction and operation of toshiba’s “new fab 2” fabrication facility which is primarily intended to provide additional clean room space to convert a significant portion of existing 2dimensional “2d” nand wafer capacity to 3d nand in addition toshiba has announced that it is investing in a new “fab 6” fabrication facility in yokkaichi japan similar to new fab 2 the additional clean room space in fab 6 is primarily intended to support the continued conversion of 2d nand capacity to 3d nand pursuant to our agreements governing flash ventures which give us priority to participate in expansions and conversions of nand manufacturing capacity we intend to jointly invest in fab 6 equipment with toshiba and our board of directors has authorized investments for our share of initial fab 6 equipment we have been in discussions with toshiba to come to mutually acceptable terms around our planned investment in fab 6 

toshiba has announced significant losses related to its us nuclear business and substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to toshiba’s financial condition toshiba’s working capital and access to credit and capital markets are severely limited toshiba could become unable to or otherwise fail to timely fund investments in flash ventures or our joint development efforts or fulfill its payment obligations to suppliers which could harm flash ventures’ operations our joint technology roadmap and supplier relationships lease financings guaranteed by both toshiba and us are not currently available to flash ventures on favorable terms and we are pursuing alternative forms of financing to fund our share of investments which might not continue to be accessible toshiba has also announced various efforts to stabilize its financial condition including a possible sale of a majority or the entire stake in its memory business which includes its interests in flash ventures according to toshiba on april 1 2017 it transferred its memory business including its interests in flash ventures to a newly formed affiliate as part of those efforts we have asserted our consent rights under the terms of the flash ventures agreements with respect to transactions involving the transfer of toshiba’s interests in flash ventures see part ii item 8 note 17  legal proceedings  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  we are monitoring and evaluating other potential impacts of toshiba’s financial condition and efforts to sell its memory business on flash ventures and in turn on our own memory business and financial condition

sales and distribution 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 80  72  and 79  of our net revenue for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and by providing information and support through our website in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs while these groups of customers make up our end markets some of these customers cross into multiple groups we define these customers as follows 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale data center operators   system integrators and hyperscale customers who bundle embed or integrate our storage solutions purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations in addition we sell directly to cloud infrastructure players as well as flash storage solutions to customers that offer our products under their own brand name in the retail market which we also classify as oems 

distributors  we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and consumer electronics “ce” manufacturers dealers valueadded resellers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our websites 

for both 2017  and 2016  no single customer accounted for 10  or more of our net revenue for 2015  hewlettpackard company accounted for 11 of our net revenue for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customers see part ii item 8 note 1  organization and basis of presentation  and note 10  business segment geographic information and concentration of risk  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form 10‑k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten years or more our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for additional information regarding our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1  organization and basis of presentation  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action

employees 

as of june 30 2017  we employed a total of approximately 68000 employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs that we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement a majority of our employees in japan and china are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10‑k

risk factors   

tableend 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties whether currently known or unknown any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or from anticipated future results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our common stock 

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole several factors contribute to these conditions and this uncertainty including but not limited to volatility in the equity credit and other financial markets and real estate markets slower growth in certain geographic regions lower levels of consumer liquidity risk of default on sovereign debt higher interest rates materials and component cost increases political uncertainty and other macroeconomic factors such as the june 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and changes to policies rules and regulations which may be proposed or implemented by the us president and his administration some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these conditions include the following 

 

 

 

 

we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba for the supply of nandflash memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results  

we are dependent on our ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nandflash memory products for our nandflash memory supply and therefore our business financial condition and operating results and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of sandisk corporation “sandisk” pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the “merger” will be dependent on the success of flash ventures 

a majority of our nandflash memory is supplied by flash ventures which limits our ability to respond to demand and supply changes a failure to accurately forecast demand could cause us to overinvest or underinvest in technology transitions or the expansion of captive memory capacity in flash ventures overinvestment could result in excess supply which could cause significant decreases in our product prices significant excess obsolete or lower of cost or net realizable value inventory writedowns or underutilization charges and the potential impairment of our investments in flash ventures on the other hand if we or toshiba underinvest in captive memory capacity or technology transitions if we grow capacity more slowly than the rest of the industry if our technology transitions do not occur on the timeline that we expect if we encounter unanticipated difficulties in implementing these transitions or if we implement technology transitions more slowly than our competitors we may not have enough captive supply of the right type of memory or at all to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis and we may lose opportunities for revenue gross margin and share as a result if our nand memory supply is limited we may make strategic decisions with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers and these strategic allocation decisions may result in less favorable gross margin in the short term or damage certain customer relationships growth of our nandflash memory bit supply at a slower rate than the overall industry for an extended period of time would result in lowering our share which could limit our future opportunities and harm our financial results we are also contractually obligated to pay for 50 of the fixed costs of flash ventures regardless of whether we purchase any wafers from flash ventures furthermore purchase orders placed with flash ventures and under the foundry arrangements with toshiba for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled therefore once our purchase decisions have been made our production costs for flash memory are fixed and we may be unable to reduce costs to match any subsequent declines in pricing or demand which would harm our gross margin our limited ability to react to fluctuations in flash memory supply and demand makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations 

in addition we partner with toshiba on the development of nandflash technology including the next technology transitions of nandflash as well as other nonvolatile memory technology in support of flash ventures 

these ventures are subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments our revenue and costs our future rate of spending our technology plans and our future growth opportunities under the terms of our venture agreements with toshiba which govern the operations of flash ventures we have limited power to unilaterally direct most of the activities that most significantly impact flash ventures’ performance the integration of sandisk into our organization could complicate the process of reaching agreement with toshiba in a timely and favorable manner we may not always agree with toshiba on our joint rd roadmap or expansions or conversions of production capacity in addition toshiba’s financial position or shift in strategic priorities could adversely impact our business 

flash ventures requires significant investments by both toshiba and us for technology transitions including the transition to 3d nand and capacity expansions in march 2016 toshiba announced plans to construct a new wafer fab in yokkaichi japan to provide additional cleanroom space to support the continued conversion of 2d nand capacity to 3d nand and we intend to participate in that wafer fab although we have had discussions to extend the joint venture partnership with toshiba to the new wafer fab there is no certainty as to when and on what terms we will participate with toshiba in any investment in equipment for the new wafer fab if at all failure to extend the joint venture partnership or failure to continue to secure and invest in additional cleanroom space to support the continued 3d nand transition could adversely impact our supply of captive nandflash memory and financial results if toshiba does not or we do not provide sufficient resources or have adequate access to credit investments in flash ventures could be delayed or reduced in addition in the event that lease financings for flash ventures are not available on favorable terms or at all more cash would be required to fund these investments 

toshiba has announced significant losses related to its us nuclear business and substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to toshiba’s financial condition toshiba’s working capital and access to credit and capital markets are severely limited toshiba could become unable to or otherwise fail to timely fund investments in flash ventures or our joint development efforts or fulfill its payment obligations to suppliers which could harm flash ventures’ operations our joint technology roadmap and supplier relationships lease financings guaranteed by both toshiba and us are not currently available to flash ventures on favorable terms and we are pursuing alternative forms of financing to fund our share of investments which might not continue to be accessible toshiba has also announced various efforts to stabilize its financial condition including a possible sale of a majority or the entire stake in its memory business according to toshiba on april 1 2017 it transferred its memory business including its interests in flash ventures to a newly formed affiliate as part of those efforts on may 14 2017 several of our sandisk subsidiaries filed a request for arbitration with the icc international court of arbitration seeking an order requiring toshiba to unwind the transfer to its affiliate and injunctive relief preventing toshiba from further breaching the flash ventures agreements copies of which are incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10‑k by transferring its interests in flash ventures without sandisk’s consent numerous proceedings and actions related to flash ventures and our consent and other rights under the terms of the flash ventures agreements followed and are ongoing please see part ii item 8 note 17  legal proceedings  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  for a further description of these proceedings and actions while we have asserted our consent rights under the terms of the flash ventures agreements with respect to transactions involving the transfer of toshiba’s interests in flash ventures our request for arbitration legal proceedings other potential litigation a change in the management or control of flash ventures or of toshiba’s memory business could lead to delays in decisionmaking disputes or changes in strategic direction that could adversely impact flash ventures and therefore adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

if a third party acquires any of toshiba’s interests in flash ventures that third party might not have the same interest that we do in protecting and growing flash ventures’ business and might have conflicts of interest between itself and flash ventures or us reduced investment in manufacturing capacity or research and development or other misalignment between us and our partner or any third party acquirer on strategic direction could impact flash ventures’ ability to stay at the forefront of technological advancement flash ventures’ competitiveness could also be harmed by a mishandling or misuse of ip or other competitively sensitive confidential information regarding flash ventures such as its technology roadmap business or investment plans by any acquirer or other third party that might gain access to such information during the bidding process 

a failure by toshiba to successfully stabilize its financial condition could lead to insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings which could result in flash ventures and related agreements being terminated early or modified unfavorably for us we are monitoring and evaluating other potential impacts of toshiba’s financial condition and efforts to sell its memory business on flash ventures and in turn on our own memory business and financial condition the deterioration of our partner’s financial condition could adversely affect the value of our investments in flash ventures and our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

integrating sandisk’s operations with ours may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the merger may not be realized 

the success of our acquisition of sandisk including anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and culture of sandisk into our company it is possible that the integration process will take longer than anticipated in addition the integration process could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs ongoing diversion of management attention the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors partners and employees if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated additionally the integration of sandisk’s operations into our operations may also increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective 

achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on our ability to integrate the business and operations of sandisk successfully and efficiently with our business the challenges involved in this integration which will be complex and timeconsuming include but are not limited to the following 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business of the size and complexity of sandisk then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger and our revenue expenses operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our high level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

in connection with the merger we substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of june 30 2017  our total indebtedness was 1336 billion  in aggregate principal and we had 100 billion  of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 

our high level of debt could have significant consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to meet the debt service obligations contained in our debt agreements will depend on our available cash and our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors including potential changes in laws or regulations industry conditions industry supply and demand balance customer preferences the success of our products and pressure from competitors if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or should we fail to comply with our financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness causing an event of default under the applicable indebtedness the debt holders could accelerate the related debt and that may result in the acceleration of any other debt leases or other obligations to which a cross acceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are required to repay our indebtedness before their due dates we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such indebtedness and we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities we may not be able to at any given time refinance our debt sell assets incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness refinancing our indebtedness may also require us to expense previous debt issuance costs or to incur new debt issuance costs 

in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

we may from time to time seek to refinance the substantial indebtedness we incurred to finance the merger by issuing additional shares of our common stock in one or more securities offerings these securities offerings may dilute our existing shareholders reduce the value of our common stock or both because our decision to issue securities will depend on among other things market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future securities offerings thus holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings diluting and potentially reducing the value of our common stock 

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining average selling prices “asps” volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share all of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

demand for our devices software and solutions that we offer to our customers which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems including personal computers “pcs” and mobile devices manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period the price of nandflash memory is influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand including the effects of new fab capacity in the industry macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions conversion of industry dram capacity to nand conversion of 2d nand capacity to 3d nand or other actions taken by us or our competitors the price of hdds is influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand including the effects of new fab capacity in the industry macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions and other actions taken by us or our competitors the storage market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and significant reductions in price if these price changes occur unnecessarily or in an unexpected manner there will likely be an adverse impact on our revenue and gross margins in addition we compete based on our ability to offer our customers competitive solutions that provide the most current and desired product and service features we expect that competition will continue to be intense and there is a risk that our competitors’ products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of goods sold rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors along with others may also result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share all of which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply excess inventory and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

we experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

sales of computer systems mobile devices storage subsystems gaming consoles and consumer electronics “ce” tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

our sales to the ce cloud computing network attached storage “nas” surveillance systems and enterprise markets which have accounted for and may continue accounting for an increasing percentage of our overall revenue may grow at a slower rate than current estimates or not at all which could materially adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

the secular growth of digital data has resulted in a more diversified mix of revenue from the ce cloud computing nas surveillance systems and enterprise markets as sales into these markets have become a more significant portion of our revenue events or circumstances that adversely impact demand in these markets or our inability to address that demand successfully could materially adversely impact our operating results for example demand in or our sales to these markets may be adversely affected by the following 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition demand in these areas also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management and the emergence of new technologies such as data duplication compression and storage virtualization if we are not able to respond appropriately these factors could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand for storage our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore our ability to accurately read and respond to market trends such as trends relating to iot or big data could harm our results 

deterioration in the pc market may continue or accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer 

while sales to nonpc markets are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the pc market remain an important part of our business we believe that sales of pcs have declined due to fundamental changes in the pc market including the growth of alternative mobile devices and the lengthening of product life cycles and that further deterioration of the pc market may continue or accelerate which could cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer additionally if demand in the pc market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions or demand for our products in the pc market decreases at a faster rate than expected our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels we must successfully respond to the rapid change away from traditional advertising media marketing and sales methods to the use of internet media and advertising particularly social media and online sales or our brand and retail sales could be negatively affected adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd hgst or sandisk brand products our operating results may be adversely affected a significant portion of our sales is made through retailers and if our retailers are not successful in selling our products not only would our revenue decrease but we could also experience lower gross margin due to the return of unsold inventory or the protection we provide to retailers against price declines 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or if distribution markets for our products weaken our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during 2017  36  of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results and financial condition would likely be harmed 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished it might not be feasible to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as mobile social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

expansion into new markets may increase the complexity of our business and cause us to increase our rd expenses and investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

to remain a significant supplier in the storage industry and to expand into new markets we will need to offer a broader range of storage products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch and 25inch hdds ssds and systems flash storage solutions and other products for the pc mobile enterprise data center and other storage markets as we expand our product lines to sell into new markets such as our recent entry into active archive systems and new flash memory business through the merger including the vertically integrated business model through flash ventures the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and we may become subject to different market dynamics these dynamics may include among other things different demand volume cyclicality seasonality product requirements sales channels and warranty and return policies in addition expansion into other markets may result in increases in rd expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability flash ventures requires significant investments by both toshiba and us for technology transitions including the transition to 3d nand and capacity expansions if we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors or new entrants who offer these products 

our vertical integration of some of our products makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop products with leading technology and overall quality increasing capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks for our business 

we develop nandflash memory as well as other nonvolatile memory technology through our partnership with toshiba we are also vertically integrated in a substantial portion of the recording heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we produce consequently for some of our products we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of technologies developed by other manufacturers since we may not have access to alternative technologies that we do not develop internally we may have to pay royalties in order to access those technologies 

in addition we may be unsuccessful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the products we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop products with leading technology and overall quality continuing the cost reductions necessary to maintain adequate gross margin and our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

further as a result of our vertical integration of some of our products we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales some of our assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves in addition as a result of adverse labor rates or availability we may be required to increase investments in automation which may cause our capital expenditures to increase if we do not adequately address these challenges our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

we make significant investments in rd to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments or investments that are not cost effective could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a leading supplier of hard drives and flash storage solutions we make significant investments to maintain our existing products and to lead innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in rd in addition we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model in order to remain competitive or as a result of the merger with sandisk which has historically maintained higher levels of investment in rd than our company the current inherent physical limitations associated with storage technologies are resulting in more costly capital expenditures that reduce the cost benefits of technology transitions and could limit our ability to keep pace with reductions in asps these investments may not result in viable technologies or products and even if they do result in viable technologies or products they may not be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful or costineffective rd efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in price capacity performance reliability serviceability industry standards or formats brand and marketing or other attributes a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is also critical to the success of our business we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage the chinese government and various agencies stateowned or affiliated enterprises and investment funds are making significant investments to promote china’s domestic semiconductor industry consistent with the government’s stated national policy objectives if we are unable to effectively compete with any manufacturers located in china or nonchinese competitors benefitting from alliances with chinese companies in the markets where we compete our operating results and financial condition will suffer 

consolidation within the data storage industry could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

the data storage industry as a whole has experienced consolidation over the past several years through acquisitions mergers and decisions by industry players to exit the industry further consolidation across the industry including by our competitors who are vertically integrated with nandflash memory may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside of storage products may over extended periods of time sell storage products at prices that we cannot profitably match 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside of storage products because they do not depend solely on sales of storage products to achieve profitability they may sell storage products at lower prices and operate their storage business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonstorage products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their storage products at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

if we fail to qualify our products and achieve design wins with our customers it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers and the product qualification process may be lengthy for some customers including those in enterprise storage once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems and hyperscale customers which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures even if our products meet customer specifications our sales to these customers are dependent upon the customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products in sufficient volume our ability to supply our products in sufficient quantity and in a timely manner and with respect to oem partners the oems’ ability to create market and successfully sell products containing our solutions moreover in transitioning to new technologies such as 3d nand and products we may not achieve design wins our customers may delay transition to these new technologies our competitors may transition more quickly than we do or we may experience product delays cost overruns or performance issues that could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to risks related to product defects or the unintended use or security breaches of our products which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated litigation or indemnification claims 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition product defects product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships lost revenue indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products warranty claims litigation or loss of market share with our customers including our oem and original design manufacturers “odm” customers our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provision do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

certain of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third party content and usergenerated data stored on our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by hurting our reputation requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects and expose us to litigation and indemnification claims 

in addition thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate or use in our products may contain defects in design or manufacturing that could unexpectedly result in epidemic failures and subject us to liability 

our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have entered into strategic relationships with various partners for future product development sales growth and the supply of technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing including our relationships with toshiba for nandflash memory supply in addition in the first quarter of 2017 our joint venture with unisplendour corporation limited “unis” to market and sell our current data center storage systems in china and to develop data storage systems for the chinese market in the future became operational the joint venture is 49 owned by us and 51 owned by unis and its subsidiary unissoft wuxi group co ltd please see the risk factor entitled “ because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for components subassemblies testing equipment consumables raw materials and logistics a supplier’s inability unwillingness or failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us can adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results ” for a further description of the risks associated with our reliance on external suppliers these strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations and financial condition these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our strategic relationships are unsuccessful or there are unanticipated changes in or termination of our strategic relationships our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for components subassemblies testing equipment consumables raw materials and logistics a supplier’s inability unwillingness or failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us can adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results    

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware preamps controller components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing chip assembly product assembly and product testing and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our justintime hubs distribution centers and freight from suppliers to our factories and from our factories to our customers throughout the world many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products technology and equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently our supply base has experienced industry consolidation where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation is enhanced some of our suppliers may be competitors in other areas of our business which could lead to difficulties in price negotiations or meeting our supply requirements any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results 

from time to time our suppliers have experienced difficulty meeting our requirements if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers we may not be able to meet demand for our products we do not have longterm contracts with some of our existing suppliers nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers and therefore we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our products we are not able to directly control product delivery schedules or quality assurance furthermore we manufacture on a turnkey basis with some of our suppliers in these arrangements we do not have visibility and control of our suppliers’ inventories of purchased parts necessary to build our products or of the progress of our products through their assembly line any significant problems that occur at our suppliers or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems either of which would harm our operating results and financial condition in addition if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers we may not be able to engage alternative suppliers who are able or willing to provide goods or services in sufficient quantities or at a cost acceptable to us 

our products require preamps controllers and firmware we rely on a limited number of thirdparty vendors to develop or supply controllers for many of our highvalue solutions any delays or cost increases in developing or sourcing controllers or firmware or incompatibility or quality issues relating to the controllers or firmware in our products could harm our financial results as well as business relationships with our customers 

a majority of our flash memory is currently supplied by flash ventures and to a much lesser extent by thirdparty silicon suppliers any disruption or shortage in supply of flash memory from our captive or noncaptive sources would harm our operating results and financial condition many of the risks that affect us also affect our supply base and flash ventures including but not limited to having single site manufacturing locations and other facilities based in high risk regions of the world for example flash ventures is located in yokkaichi japan natural disasters power shortages macro and local economic conditions shortages of commodity materials proper management of technology transitions geopolitical risks employee strikes and other labor actions compliance with legal requirements financial instability and exposure to ip and other litigation including an injunction or other action that could delay shipping if any of these risks were to affect our suppliers or flash ventures we could also be adversely affected especially in the case of products components or services that are singlesourced for example if suppliers are facing increased costs due to the above risks they may require us to enter into longterm volume agreements to shift the burden of fixed costs to us further we work closely with many of our suppliers and strategic partners to develop new technologies and as a result we may become subject to litigation from our suppliers strategic partners or third parties 

without a capable and financially stable supply base that has established appropriate relationships within the supply chain and has implemented business processes strategies and risk management safeguards we would be unable to develop our products manufacture them in high volumes and distribute them to our customers to execute our business plans effectively some of our suppliers have also experienced a decline in financial performance our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors consolidate or decide to exit the industry redirect their investments and increase costs to us each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition moving to new technologies may require us to align to and build a new supply base our success in new product areas may be dependent on our ability to develop close relationships with new suppliers with preferential agreements where this cannot be done our business and operations may be adversely affected 

in addition to an external supply base we also rely on an internal supply chain of heads media and media substrate and we rely on our business ventures with toshiba for the supply of nandflash memory please see the risk factors entitled “ the substitution or replacement of our technologies and products by new technologies could make our products obsolete and harm our operating results ” “ if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected ”  and “ we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba for the supply of nandflash memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results ” for a review of some of the risks related to these supplies 

price volatility shortages of critical materials or components or use by other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry may negatively impact our operating results 

increases in the cost for certain critical materials and components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting our products and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers shortages of critical components such as dram and nandflash memory or materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of uncertain global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected  

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire or keep pace with asp reduction which could harm our operating results for example in transitioning our 2d nand manufacturing capacity to 3d nand technology we could experience delays or other challenges in the production ramp qualification of wafers shipment of samples to customers or customer approval process 3d nand and any new manufacturing node may be more susceptible to manufacturing yield issues manufacturing yield issues may not be identified during the development or production process or solved until an actual product is manufactured and tested further increasing our costs if our technology transitions including the production ramp of 3d nand technology take longer are more costly to complete than anticipated or do not improve manufacturing yield or other manufacturing efficiencies our flash memory costs may not remain competitive with other nandflash memory producers or may not fall commensurate with declines in the price of nandflash memory which would harm revenues our gross margin and operating results   

many companies including some of our competitors have developed or are attempting to develop alternative nonvolatile technologies successful broadbased commercialization of one or more competing technologies as well as differing strategies and timing with respect to the transition from 2d nand to 3d nand could reduce the competitiveness and future revenue and profitability of our 2d nand and 3d nandflash technologies for additional technology transition risks related to 3d nand see “ we rely substantially on our business ventures with toshiba for the supply of nandflash memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results  ” 

in addition if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting technologies to implement these new technologies are not available we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product longer product life cycles could also restrict our ability to transition customers to our newer products in a timely manner or at all negatively impacting our ability to recoup our significant rd investments to improve our existing technology and develop new technologies if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

the substitution or replacement of our technologies and products by new technologies could make our products obsolete and harm our operating results  

given the pace of technological development there is a possibility that new technologies could substitute for or replace our current technologies and products and make them obsolete historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in storage technologies or standards any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate or manufacture the new technology or standard fails to remain competitive there are some revolutionary technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic recording heatassisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition many companies including some of our competitors have developed or are attempting to develop alternative nonvolatile technologies including nonnand technologies such as magnetoresistive randomaccess memory “ram” resistive randomaccess memory “reram” and phase change as well as nand based vertical or stacked 3d memories based on charge trap floating gate and other cell architecture in embedded solutions certain competitors have recently introduced a mobile storage standard referred to as universal flash storage “ufs” in the data center market certain competitors have recently introduced a nonvolatile memory express “nvme” product that can be used as a substitute for our peripheral component interconnect express “pcie” solutions in addition a provider of processors and nonvolatile memory solutions may be developing a new standard to attach ultralow latency nonvolatile memory to its processor memory bus which it may choose not to license to its competitors resulting in it being a single source provider of such nonvolatile memory solutions as a result of these shifts in technology and standards we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as recording heads magnetic media and tools in adopting new standards or in investing in different capital equipment or manufacturing processes to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or standards or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies or standards we may not be able to offer products with capacities and capabilities that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter higher areal densities require existing recording head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however increasing areal density has become more difficult in the storage industry if we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to include more components in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new test equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gigabytes per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

our license and royalty revenue may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future due to license agreement expirations or renewals declines in sales of the products or use of technology underlying the license and royalty revenue by our licensees or if licensees fail to perform on a portion or all of their contractual obligations 

if our existing licensees do not renew their licenses upon expiration renew or sign new agreements on less favorable terms exercise their option to terminate the license or fail to exercise their option to extend the licenses or we are not successful in signing new licensees in the future our license revenue profitability and cash provided by operating activities would be harmed and we may incur significant patent litigation costs to enforce our patents against these licensees as our older patents expire and the coverage of our newer patents may be different it may be more difficult to negotiate or renew favorable license agreement terms or a license agreement at all our agreements may require us in certain instances to recognize license revenue related to a particular licensee all in one period instead of over time which could create additional volatility in our licensing revenue a portion of our license and royalty revenue is based on sales of product categories as well as the underlying technology and fluctuations in the sales of those products or technology adoption rates would also result in fluctuations in the license and royalty revenue due to us under our agreements if our licensees or we fail to perform on contractual obligations we may incur costs to enforce or defend the terms of our licenses and there can be no assurance that our enforcement defense or collection efforts will be effective if we license new ip from third parties or existing licensees we may be required to pay license fees royalty payments or offset existing license revenue we may enter into agreements with customers suppliers or partners that could limit our ability to monetize our ip or could result in us being required to provide ip indemnification to our customers suppliers or partners in addition we may be subject to disputes claims or other disagreements on the timing amount or collection of royalties or license payments under our license agreements 

if we do not properly manage new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with technology advancements advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in other emerging technologies that can be competitive with traditional storage technologies we may be unsuccessful in anticipating and developing new and improved products for the client enterprise and other storage markets in response to competing technologies if our hard drive solidstate products and our storage solutions products fail to offer a superior value proposition to alternative storage products we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our business will suffer in some cases our customers’ demand for a more diversified portfolio results in investments in new products for a particular market that do not necessarily expand overall market opportunity which may negatively affect our operating results as we introduce new products standards or technologies it can take time for these new standards or technologies to be adopted for consumers to accept and transition to these new standards or technologies and for significant sales to be generated if at all failure of consumers or enterprises to adopt our new products standards or technologies could harm our results of operations as we fail to reap the benefits of our investments 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in particular as part of our growth strategy we have made significant investments in active archive systems which are designed to enable organizations to rapidly access massive longterm data stores for example our acquisition of amplidata nv in march 2015 was partially driven by our strategy to expand in this area we expect to continue to make significant investments in active archive systems our active archive systems may fail to gain market acceptance or the market for active archive systems may not grow as we anticipate 

we have also seen and anticipate continuing to see an increase in customers requesting that we develop products including software associated with our products that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment adapting to this demand may cause product delays placing us at a competitive disadvantage open source products could also reduce our capability for product differentiation or innovation and our affected products could be diminished to commodity status which we expect would place increased downward pressure on our margins if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage issues associated with our product development generally our business may suffer 

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the concentration of flash ventures in yokkaichi japan magnifies the risks of supply disruption the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’ other suppliers such as the spread of a pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of our products that we are able to manufacture or sell which would result in substantial harm to our operating results similarly a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities including access to or from these facilities by employees or logistics operators would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results for example prior to the 2011 flooding in thailand all of our internal slider capacity and 60 of our hard drive manufacturing capacity was in thailand as a result of the flooding in thailand our facilities were inundated and temporarily shut down during that period our ability to manufacture hard drives was significantly constrained adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from localized labor unrest or other employment issues a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

we may incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the scope of the coverage of our insurance policies there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially due to market availability pricing or other reasons we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some cases no coverage at all for natural disasters and environmental damages as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost we depend upon toshiba to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash ventures if toshiba fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses and such failure could also cause flash ventures to breach various financing covenants 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems security vulnerabilities or design defects or sustain system failures our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors and partners may also experience such attacks cyber attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities our products are also targets for cyber attacks while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers we have agreed with certain customers and strategic partners including toshiba to undertake certain commitments to promote information security and we may be liable to toshiba or such other parties if we fail to meet our cyber security commitments 

in addition our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures further our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result we could experience additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

manufacturing marketing and selling our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

currently a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and many of our products and components are produced overseas our revenue and future growth is significantly dependent on the growth of international markets and we may face difficulties in entering or maintaining international sales markets we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing and sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of and reliance on contract manufacturers including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of these risks our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected some of these risks such as trade restrictions higher tariffs and fees import and export restrictions or loss of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities could increase as a result of changes to policies rules and regulations which may be proposed or implemented by the us president and his administration 

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

recent terrorist incidents around the world and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we our suppliers or our customers operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities rd activities including our operations in israel or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected any of these events could also increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could have a negative effect on our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers or adversely affect consumer confidence 

sudden disruptions to the availability of air transportation or ocean or land freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of air transportation cargo operations or ocean rail or truck freight lanes caused by among other things labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently receive shipments from our suppliers or deliver our products 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions which are a key part of our growth strategy it may adversely affect our future results 

we seek to be an industryleading developer manufacturer and provider of innovative storage solutions balancing our core hard drive and flash memory business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions we are also subject to certain covenants in our debt agreements which place limits on our ability to complete acquisitions and investments even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition acquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our shareholders and the issuance of additional indebtedness which would put additional pressure on liquidity furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully integrate the business and operations of hgst our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of hgst we agreed to certain conditions required by the ministry of commerce of the people’s republic of china “mofcom” including adopting measures to keep hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agreed otherwise on october 19 2015 mofcom announced that it had made a decision allowing us to integrate substantial portions of our hgst and wd subsidiaries provided that we continue to offer both hgst and wd product brands and maintain separate sales teams that will separately offer products under the wd and hgst brands for two years from the date of the decision 

as a result of mofcom’s decision we immediately began planning for the integration of the substantial portions of our hgst and wd subsidiaries that we are now allowed to integrate including corporate functions rd recording heads and magnetic media operations engineering and manufacturing we expect this integration to continue through the end of calendar year 2017 our integration efforts during this time may involve significant management time and create uncertainty for employees and customers any delays in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the loss of customers the disruption of our company’s ongoing business or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated additionally the integration of the operations of our hgst and western digital technologies inc “wdt” subsidiaries may also increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective further until we are able to begin combining our hgst and wd product brands and sales teams following the expiration of the mofcom restrictions on october 19 2017 we will continue to incur additional costs to maintain separate brands and sales teams these additional costs along with any delay in the integration process or higher than expected integration costs or other integration issues could adversely affect our ability to achieve the full operating expense synergies we expect from integration of the businesses of our hgst and wdt subsidiaries any failure to achieve the full operating expense synergies that we expect from this integration could harm our business and financial condition achieving these synergies is also subject to significant business operational economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies and we cannot assure you that any or all of these synergies will be achieved in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated time frames or cost expectations or at all 

the loss of our key executive management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees including employees from acquisitions and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we lose our existing key management staff or skilled employees or are unable to hire and integrate new key management staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key management or staff our operating results would likely be harmed furthermore if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our intended realignment after we make decisions regarding our personnel and implement our realignment plans our operating results could be adversely affected 

we and certain of our officers are at times involved in litigation investigations and governmental proceedings which may be costly may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings fines or penalties which could materially harm our business 

we are involved in litigation including cases involving our ip rights and those of others antitrust and commercial matters putative securities class action suits and other actions we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others some of the actions seek injunctive relief including injunctions against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results from time to time we may also be the subject of inquiries requests for information investigations and actions by government and regulatory agencies regarding our businesses any such matters could result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including fines penalties or restrictions on our business activities 

litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations in the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation investigation or governmental proceeding we could be required to pay substantial damages fines or penalties and cease certain practices or activities including the manufacture use and sale of products with or without merit such matters can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by us could also result in counterclaims against us which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us in addition litigation investigations or governmental proceedings and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel and may also harm the market prices of our securities 

we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation investigations or governmental proceedings these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits the cost of governmental law enforcement or regulatory investigations or proceedings civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measures if any which may be imposed 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use sharing and security of thirdparty data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm  

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data and employee data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other ip rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we have historically been involved in frequent disputes regarding patent and other ip rights and we have in the past received and we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other ip rights we may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license ip to others ip risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no ip protection as a defense against litigation the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of ip litigation increase the ip risks we face litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may be subject to injunctions enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

if we incorporate thirdparty technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the ip of others we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier customer or partner could negatively impact our business 

moreover from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged ip infringement the scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses including attorneys’ fees we may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

our reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable ip such as our process technology we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes there can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us it is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection there are entities whom we believe may infringe our ip enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our ip to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered ip rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

the success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands we believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products any occurrence of counterfeiting imitation or confusion with our brands could adversely affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands which in turn could negatively impact sales of our branded products our share and our gross margin as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution 

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the electronics industry citizenship coalition “eicc” could cause an increase in our operating costs 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our suppliers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which would have a materially adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the eicc the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain components and metals contained in our products 

we are subject to the sec’s diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use and source of gold tantalum tin and tungsten commonly referred to as 3tg or conflict minerals which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies as a result of these rules we report annually regarding whether such 3tg originated from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain 3tg or 3tg generally at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of such components or 3tg since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” 3tg our customers including our oem customers may require and some of our customers have notified us that they require that our products contain only conflict free 3tg and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement additionally we may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders and challenges from government regulators if our products are not conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the 3tg contained in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we could incur significant costs to the extent that we are required to make changes to products processes or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures conflict minerals legislation in europe canada or any other jurisdiction could increase these risks 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers customers or partners could harm our business 

we expect our suppliers customers and partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers customers partners or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of them or divergence of their business practices from those generally accepted as ethical could harm our business by 

 

 

 

 

 

flash ventures’ equipment lease agreements contain covenants and other cancellation events and cancellation of the leases would harm our business operating results and financial condition 

flash ventures sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions “lessors” a portion of its equipment and flash ventures has entered into equipment lease agreements most of which we and toshiba each guarantee half of the total outstanding obligations and some of which we guarantee in full for our share of the flash ventures investment as of june 30 2017  the portion of outstanding flash ventures’ lease obligations covered by our guarantees totaled approximately 968 million  based upon the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate at june 30 2017  the equipment lease agreements contain covenants and cancellation events that are customary for japanese lease facilities and that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors cancellation events relating to the guarantors include among other things an assignment of all or a substantial part of a guarantor’s business a bankruptcy event involving a guarantor and acceleration of other monetary debts of a guarantor above a specified threshold 

the breach of a covenant or the occurrence of another cancellation event could result in an acceleration of the flash ventures’ lease obligations if a cancellation event were to occur flash ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the lessors as well as other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us as guarantor increased interest rates or waiver fees if a cancellation event occurs and we fail to reach a resolution we may be required to pay all or a portion of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 

any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue cost of goods sold margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin in addition our purchases of nandflash memory from flash ventures and our investment in flash ventures are denominated in japanese yen if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar our cost of purchasing nandflash memory wafers and the cost to us of future capital funding of flash ventures would increase which could negatively impact our operating results if any of these events occur they would have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the us therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the us fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the us 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place thus our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and harm our operating results further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions operating losses third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales may occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

our cash balances and investment portfolio are subject to various risks any of which could adversely impact our financial position 

given the international footprint of our business we have both domestic and international cash balances and investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings security types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market political sovereign and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a material part of our investment portfolio consists of investment grade corporate securities bank deposits asset backed securities and us government and agency securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that our investments may experience an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” limits could also have an adverse impact on our financial position 

in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to repay our indebtedness fund acquisitions pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock we may choose or be required to increase our borrowings if available or to repatriate funds to the us at a substantial tax cost we must comply with regulations regarding the conversion and distribution of funds earned in the local currencies of various countries if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in these countries 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our stock price may be adversely affected 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 30 2017  in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting in future periods investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements we may be required to restate our financial results our access to capital markets may be limited and we may be subject to sanctions from regulatory agencies and the nasdaq global select market each of which may adversely affect our stock price 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax examinations or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received a revenue agent’s report seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 13  income tax expense benefit  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with loss or nonrenewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met we may not be able to meet such conditions if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future in addition any actions by us to repatriate nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes may impact our effective tax rate 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws and regulations are passed and new interpretations of the laws are issued or applied while the former us administration and members of congress made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority and certain changes to the us tax laws and regulations have been made and others proposed additional changes may be proposed by the current us administration or members of congress and new us tax laws and regulations may go into effect in addition many countries in the european union and around the globe have adopted andor proposed changes to current tax laws further organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that if adopted by countries where we do business could increase our tax obligations in these countries due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations

acquisition of sandisk 

on may 12 2016 the “sandisk closing date” we completed the acquisition of sandisk the “merger” a global leader in nandflash storage solutions pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger dated october 21 2015 the merger is primarily intended to deepen our expertise in nonvolatile memory and enable us to vertically integrate into nand securing longterm access to solid state technology at a lower cost the aggregate purchase price of the merger was 1559 billion  this acquisition broadened our product portfolio significantly increased our revenues in 2017  and enhanced our gross margins operating expenses also increased with the assumption of the sandisk operations for additional information on the acquisition see part ii item 8 note 15  acquisitions  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

debt facilities 

in connection with the merger we entered into new debt facilities aggregating approximately 1809 billion  in principal to finance a portion of the purchase price related to the merger the proceeds were also used to refinance certain existing indebtedness of western digital and sandisk and pay certain transaction costs this new debt significantly increased our interest expense in 2017 during 2017  we repaid a 300 billion  shortterm bridge loan made a voluntary 750 million  principal payment on one of the term loans and entered into several repricing transactions that significantly lowered the rate of interest on some of the new term loans we also settled a substantial portion of the remaining assumed sandisk convertible notes the reductions in principal and the repricing transactions are expected to lower our interest expense going forward compared to 2017  for additional information see part ii item 8 note 6  debt  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements included in this annual  report on form 10‑k

results of operations 

summary comparison of 2017  2016  and 2015 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our   consolidated statements of operations by dollars and percentage of net revenue 



the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding net revenues by geography and end market 



for 2017  and 2016  no customer accounted for 10  or more of our net revenue for 2015  one customer hewlettpackard company accounted for 11  of our net revenue for   2017  2016  and 2015  our top 10 customers accounted for 36  43  and 44  of our net revenue respectively 

fiscal year 2017  net revenue and gross margin compared to fiscal year 2016  net revenue and gross margin 

net revenue net revenue was 1909 billion  for 2017  an increase  of 610 billion  or 47  as compared to 2016  primarily due to a full year of revenue from the sale of nandflash products following the sandisk closing date compared to a partial year of such revenue in the prior year this increase was partially offset by lower revenue related to lower pc and enterprise hdd shipments 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2017  and 2016  these programs represented 12  and 13  of gross revenues respectively the decrease in sales incentive and marketing programs yearoveryear reflects lower incentive programs offered on nandflash products as a result of the merger the amounts attributed to our sales incentive and marketing programs also generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue 

net revenue by geography changes in the mix of net revenue by geography for 2017  as compared to 2016  reflect the additional revenues from the merger which has comparatively higher revenue in asia than our preacquisition business 

net revenue by end market our end markets include data center devices and solutions capacity and performance enterprise hdd enterprise ssd data center software and system solutions client devices mobile desktop gaming and digital video hard drives client ssds embedded products and wafers and client solutions removable products hard drive content solutions and flash content solutions 

changes in the mix of net revenue by end market for 2017  as compared to 2016  reflect the full year increase in revenues from the merger which has comparatively higher revenue in client devices and client solutions than our preacquisition business 

gross profit and gross margin gross profit was 607 billion  for 2017  an increase  of 264 billion  or 77  as compared to 2016  largely driven by the increase in revenue mentioned above gross profit for 2017  was negatively impacted by amortization expense on acquired intangible assets charges related to the implementation of costsaving initiatives stockbased compensation and acquisition related charges which aggregated 114 billion  or 60  of revenue for 2017  and 375 million  or 29  of revenue for 2016  gross margin increased to 318  for 2017  as compared to 264  for 2016  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to sales of nandflash products following the sandisk closing date as such products have comparatively higher gross margins than our preacquisition products cost improvements across all products driven by manufacturing integration activities and cost improvements as nandflash technology transitions to more cost efficient designs 

fiscal year 2016  net revenue and gross margin compared to fiscal year 2015  net revenue and gross margin 

net revenue net revenue was 1299 billion  for 2016  a decrease  of 158 billion  or 11  as compared to 2015  primarily due to lower hdd unit shipments partially offset by an increase in hdd asps and partial year revenues from sandisk of 793 million following the sandisk closing date the decrease in hdd unit shipments was primarily due to a softer demand environment the increase in hdd asps was primarily due to a change in hdd product mix 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2016  and 2015  these programs represented 13  and 10  of gross revenues respectively these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue 

net revenue by geography changes in the mix of net revenue by geography for 2016  as compared to 2015  reflect a decrease in asia primarily due to reduced demand of client hdd shipments as a result of a decline in the desktop and notebook pc market and a decrease in europe middle east and africa due to lower demand for our client and retail hdd products primarily due to the continued decline of pcrelated aftermarket sales 

net revenue by end market changes in the mix of net revenue by end market for 2016  as compared to 2015  reflected lower client devices revenues primarily due to reduced demand for hdds as a result of a decline in desktop and notebook pc market partially offset by a partial year increase in revenues from the merger which has comparatively higher revenue in client devices and client solutions than our preacquisition business 

gross profit and gross margin gross profit was 344 billion  for 2016  a decrease of 786 million  or 19  from 2015  gross margin decreased to 264  in 2016  as compared to 290  in 2015  this decrease was primarily the result of lower hdd unit sales and the related absorption impact and accelerated depreciation on assets related to both the closure of the odawara japan facility and the restructuring plan “restructuring plan 2016” associated with the integration of substantial portions of our hgst and wd subsidiaries this decrease in gross profit was partially offset by sandisk’s gross profit following the sandisk closing date

fiscal year 2016  operating expenses compared to fiscal year 2015  operating expenses 

rd expense was 163 billion  in 2016  a decrease  of 19 million  or 1  from 2015  this slight decrease was primarily due to reductions in employee compensation expenses due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our business realignment initiatives reduction in material spend due to the consolidation of our product roadmap in relation to the integration of our hgst and wd subsidiaries and an additional week in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by sandisk’s rd expenses following the sandisk closing date and expenses related to the integration of our hgst and wd subsidiaries 

sga expense was 997 million  in 2016  an increase  of 209 million  or 27  from 2015  this increase was primarily due to sandisk’s sga expenses following the sandisk closing date acquisition charges and expenses related to the integration of our hgst and wd subsidiaries these charges were partially offset by a reduction in employee compensation expenses due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our business realignment initiatives and an additional week in the prior year

fiscal year 2017  interest and other expense net compared to fiscal year 2016  interest and other expense net 

total interest and other expense net  increased 872 million  in 2017  primarily due to a full year of interest expense in 2017  resulting from the additional debt issued in connection with the merger compared to only a partial year of such expense in 2016  as well as losses on the settlements of certain of our term loans see part ii item 8 note 6  debt  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  and impairment charges related to our costmethod investments 

fiscal year 2016   interest and other income expense  compared to fiscal year 2015   interest and other income expense 

in 2016  total interest and other expense net  increased 279 million  over 2015  primarily due to interest expense resulting from the additional debt incurred in connection with the merger the loss on the settlement of convertible debt and writeoff of debt issuance costs on settlement of other previously issued debt 

income tax expense benefit 

the following table sets forth income tax information from our consolidated statement of operations by dollar and effective tax rate 



fiscal year 2017  income tax expense compared to fiscal year 2016  income tax benefit 

income tax expense was 372 million  in 2017  as compared to an income tax benefit of 89 million  in 2016  income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 48  in 2017  as compared to income tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes of 58  in 2016  income tax expense in 2017  reflects tax expense from the integration of sandisk and a valuation allowance on both acquired tax attributes and net operating loss carryforwards from restructuring activities the difference between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of 35 is primarily due to taxes on the integration of sandisk and an increase in the valuation allowance for both acquired tax attributes and net operating loss carryforwards from restructuring activities which are partially offset by the current year generation of tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower tax rates due to tax holidays in malaysia philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2018 through 2030 

the internal revenue service “irs” previously completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 and proposed certain adjustments we have received revenue agent reports from the irs that seek to increase our us taxable income which would result in additional federal tax expense totaling 795 million subject to interest the issues in dispute relate primarily to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and intercompany payable balances we disagree with the proposed adjustments and in september 2015 filed a protest with the irs appeals office and received the irs rebuttal in july 2016 we believe that our tax positions are properly supported and will vigorously contest the position taken by the irs in september 2015 the irs commenced an examination of our fiscal years 2010 through 2012 

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax examinations are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of june 30 2017  it is not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months any significant change in the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns 

for additional information regarding income tax expense benefit see part ii item 8 note 13  income tax expense benefit  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

fiscal year 2016  income tax benefit compared to fiscal year 2015  income tax expense 

income tax benefit was 89 million  in 2016  as compared to a 112 million  expense in 2015  tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes was 582  in 2016  as compared to tax expense of 71  in 2015  fiscal year 2016  income tax benefit reflects tax benefits from expenses related to the merger and from interest expense related to new debt facilities the difference between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower tax rates due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2016 through 2029 the current year generation of income tax credits and the tax deductible expenses related to the merger 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows 



we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt dividend and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in part i item 1a risk factors  in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

the indebtedness used to finance the merger could cause us to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital capital expenditure needs dividends or to pursue other potential strategic plans 

during 2018 we expect cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment and net activity in notes receivable and equity investments relating to flash ventures to be approximately 15 billion  to 19 billion  of our cash the total expected cash to be used could vary depending on the timing and completion of various capital projects and the availability timing and terms of related financing 

a total of 499 billion  and 690 billion  of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the us as of june 30 2017  and july 1 2016  respectively our current plans anticipate we can meet our us cash needs while continuing to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in the event the reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are distributed to the us such a distribution could result in the accrual and payment of additional us taxes 

operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash provided by  changes in working capital was 91 million  for 2017  as compared to net cash provided by  changes in working capital of 374 million  for 2016  and net cash used for  changes in working capital of 593 million  for 2015  

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the cash conversion cycles were as follows 



changes in days sales outstanding “dsos” are generally due to the linearity of shipments changes in days in inventory “dios” are generally related to the timing of inventory builds changes in days payables outstanding “dpos” are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

the working capital metrics in 2016  were notably impacted by the inclusion of sandisk’s accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable balances as of july 1 2016  but only including sandisk’s revenue and cost of sales following the sandisk closing date the merger inflated dso dio and dpo by 12 days 32 days and 14 days respectively excluding the impact of the merger in 2016  dso in 2017 increased  by 8 days over 2016  and was 2 days lower than 2015  primarily reflecting timing of customer receipts in the prior year excluding the impact of the merger in 2016  dio in 2017   increased  by 16 days over both 2016  and 2015  the increase in dio primarily reflects shortterm buildup of inventory to maintain supply as we close certain facilities and transition production excluding the impact of the merger in 2016  dpo in 2017  increased by 2 days over 2016  and decreased by 1 day from 2015  primarily reflecting routine variations in timing purchases and payments during the period 

investing activities 

during 2017  net cash used in  investing activities primarily consisted of 578 million  of capital expenditures and a net 277 million  increase in notes receivable to and investments in flash ventures partially offset by cash provided by a net 230 million  decrease in our investments in marketable securities during 2016  net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of 984 billion  related to the merger net of cash acquired 632 million  related to the purchase of investments 584 million  of capital expenditures 90 million  net increase in notes receivable to flash ventures and a net 76 million  of other investing activities partially offset by 120 billion  of proceeds from sales of investments and 405 million  of proceeds from maturities of investments during 2015  net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of 857 million related to the purchase of investments 612 million of capital expenditures and 257 million related to acquisitions net of cash acquired partially offset by 505 million  of proceeds from sales of investments and 263 million  of proceeds from maturities of investments 

our cash equivalents are primarily invested in highly liquid money market funds that are invested in us treasury securities and us government agency securities as well as bank certificates of deposit in addition we invest directly in us treasury securities us and international government agency securities certificates of deposit assetbacked securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds

we expect the implementation of the new standard to impact the recognition of our revenue as follows 

 

 

 

 

as we are completing our assessment we are also identifying and preparing to implement changes to our processes internal controls and systems configurations from the implementation of the new revenue standard we do not currently expect any significant changes to our other accounting policies from the adoption of the new revenue standard our implementation efforts are progressing as planned 

for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 note 2  recently adopted accounting pronouncements  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to consolidated financial statements  may be material 

revenue 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions andor a right of return and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection andor returns until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information historical and anticipated returns information and customer claim processing if customer demand for our products or market conditions differ from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 8  to 14  of gross revenue and adjustments to revenue due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenue reported in prior periods have generally averaged less than 1 of gross revenue over the last three fiscal years 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates for additional information see part ii item 8 note 17  legal proceedings  of the notes to   consolidated financial statements  included in this annual  report on form 10‑k  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we either use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired or we perform a twostep approach to quantify impairment if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to follow a twostep approach to quantify the impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit if our stock price decreases significantly goodwill could become impaired which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations 

inprocess research and development “iprd” is an intangible asset accounted as an indefinitelived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated rd effort during the development period we conduct an iprd impairment test annually and whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the iprd is impaired events which might indicate impairment include but are not limited to adverse cost factors strategic decisions made in response to economic market and competitive conditions   the impact of the economic environment on us and our customer base if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

other longlived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for product costs and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months  we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes for additional information see part ii item 8 note 4  fair value measurements and investments  and note 5  derivative instruments and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form 10‑k 

as of june 30 2017  we had outstanding the foreign exchange contracts presented in the following table the changes in fair values of these foreign exchange contracts would be largely offset in other income expense by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 





 

during 2017  and 2016  total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements  

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

disclosure about other market risks 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under our term loan a and our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor rate subject to a 00  floor plus an applicable margin of 200  or at a base rate plus an applicable margin of 10   323  as of june 30 2017  the applicable margin for the borrowings under our term loan a and our revolving credit facility will range depending on our leverage from 150 to 225 for libor loans and from 050 to 125 for base rate loans 

borrowings under the us term loan b2  tranche bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of an adjusted libor rate subject to a 075  floor plus 275  or a base rate plus 175   398  as of june 30 2017  borrowings under the euro term loan b2  tranche bear interest at a rate per annum at our option equal to an adjusted euribor rate subject to a 075  floor plus 200   275  as of june 30 2017  

we have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt at june 30 2017  61 of the par value of our debt was at variable rates to balance the portfolio we entered into a payfixed interest rate swap on 100 billion  notional amount which effectively converts a portion of our term loan to fixed rates through may 2020 as of june 30 2017  we had 810 billion  of variable rate debt after giving effect to the 100 billion  of interest rate swaps we effectively had 710 billion  of longterm debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest subject to each loan’s specific floor would increase annual interest expense by 61 million

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by sec rule 13a‑15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a‑15f and 15d‑15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013  based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10‑k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see report of independent registered public accounting firm herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 30 2017  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing expansion in digital content generation and management these trends are linked directly to commercial enterprises’ and consumers’ increasingly ubiquitous experience with data and the increasing value of that data the confluence of data growth and the ability to expand the extraction of value from data are driving the need for the longterm retention of as much data as possible for legal and regulatory purposes and for potential future refinements in a wide range of fields including advertising aerospace ecommerce energy medical mining and security surveillance we believe the ways in which people and organizations are creating and using data are changing and that the amount of data considered useful to store is expanding increasingly more and more digital content is being stored and managed on hdds and ssds in a cloud environment and we believe we are well positioned to continue to play a role in this transition with a focus on innovation and value creation our goal is to grow through continued strong execution and with targeted investments in datacenter infrastructure mobility and the cloud 

two pivotal events in fiscal 2016 contributed to the ongoing strategic transformation of our company in this context 



industry 

we operate in the data storage and data management industry our devices and solutions are made using rotating magnetic or nonvolatile memory storage technologies “nand” that together provide a broad range of reliability performance storage capacity and data retention capabilities to our customers with increasing ability to capture and create meaning from data customers view data analytics insight as one of their most treasured assets in a connected global marketplace there is a proliferation in the methods by and the rates at which content is generated consumed and stored by end users when combined with fast global networks these trends create tremendous need for cost effective highperformance andor highcapacity storage solutions in mobile computing and consumer electronic devices as well as in a wide range of storage systems servers and datacenters we are a market and customer driven company focused on growth innovation and value creation for our customers employees and shareholders we develop deep and collaborative relationships with our customers with a goal of enabling their continued success an approach that has made us a trusted advisor and market maker in our served markets as our portfolio of storage solutions expands further we believe our customer engagement approach is one of the key factors that will help us continue to achieve strong financial performance over the long term we believe that our product platform is broadbased and powerful and our unique competitive advantages with growth drivers will continue to provide us the opportunity to expand our valuecreation model within an evolving changing and growing storage ecosystem 

storage solutions that hold large amounts of data are a key enabler of the trends seen in the evolution of a data driven economy underpinned by the proliferation of digital content creation consumption and monetization we believe the growth in the number of computing users and connected mobile devices in the world continues unabated creating varied usage patterns and the need for greater volumes of digital content to be stored cloud computing applications are especially noteworthy in their ability to generate more data through creation of multiple copies of content such as photos videos and in other formats to ensure smooth user experience in a secure manner 

there are several key shifts underway in the data storage industry including a change in the methods of storage in client devices both desktop and notebook pcs the increased use of ssds in client devices and the shift of data storage from client or local devices to the cloud as a broadbased provider of data storage technologies devices and solutions in both the client and datacenter markets we are strategically positioned to manage through these transitions address these changes and meet the needs of our customers 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive we compete with manufacturers of hdds and ssds for client devices and solutions and datacenter devices and solutions the hdd market consists of five principal brands hgst samsung electronics co ltd “samsung” seagate technology llc “seagate” toshiba corporation “toshiba” and wd in ssds and storage solutions we compete with a wide range of manufacturers from numerous small startup companies to large multinational corporations including captive nand suppliers sk hynix inc intel corporation micron technology inc samsung and toshiba 

  the storage industry is increasingly utilizing tiered architectures with both hdds and ssds to address an expanding set of uses and applications we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis to ensure we are appropriately resourced to meet our customers’   storage needs 

business strategy 

our overall strategy is to leverage our innovation and execution capabilities to be an industryleading and broadbased developer manufacturer and provider of storage devices and solutions that support the evolving it industry infrastructure that enables the unabated proliferation of data we strive to successfully execute our strategy through the following foundational elements 



 we believe our strategy provides the following benefits which distinguish us in the dynamic and competitive storage industry

technology 

rotating magnetic storage 

hdds provide nonvolatile data storage based on the recording of magnetic information on a spinning disk the storage capacity of an hdd is given by the number of disks in the hdd enclosure multiplied by the surface area of each disk multiplied by the areal density bits per unit area of the magnetic bits recorded on the disk surface improvements over time in magnetic recording areal density hdd capacity have been enabled largely through advancements in recording head and magnetic media technology we develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the recording heads and magnetic media used in our hard drive products as areal density increases we can achieve greater hdd capacities andor lower product costs over time we invest considerable resources in rd manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment for recording head and media technology as well as in other aspects of the magnetic recording system such as hdd mechanics controller and firmware technology in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

industrystandard interfaces allow the drives to communicate with the host system the primary interface for pcs is sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are fibre channel sas sata and pcie 

solid state storage 

solid state storage products provide nonvolatile storage based on nandflash technology we develop and manufacture solid state storage products in different form factors for a variety of different markets including enterprise or cloud storage client storage mobile devices and removable memory devices 

our solid state storage products leverage our internal nandflash technology which we develop and manufacture through our business ventures with toshiba we focus significant research development and effort on developing highly reliable highperformance costeffective nandflash technology we have successfully developed and commercialized 2bits per cell flash multi‑level cell “x2” and 3bits per cell flash multi‑level cell “x3” technologies which have enabled significant cost reduction and growth in nandflash usage a majority of our nand manufacturing capacity utilizes the 15nanometer node and we expect this node to be our last technology node on 2d nandflash architecture to drive further cost reduction in nand we are transitioning to a 3dimensional nand “3d nand” architecture 

in july 2016 we announced that we have successfully developed our next generation 3d nand technology bics3 with 64 layers of vertical storage capability bics3 will feature the use of x3 technology along with advances in high aspect ratio semiconductor processing we expect to develop and commercialize additional generations of 3d nand technologies over the next several years while continuing to utilize our 2d nand technology for certain markets and applications 

with toshiba we are also investing in 3d resistive randomaccess memory “reram” technology and we are collaborating with hewlett packard enterprise development lp on the further development of 3d reram for use in storage class memory applications we have also initiated defined and developed standards to meet new market needs and to promote wide acceptance of flash storage standards through interoperability and easeofuse 

our solid state storage products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner rd expenses totaled 16 billion  16 billion  and 17 billion  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we have more than 13500  active patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the laws of the united states “us” 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10‑k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our production of hdd and nandflash products are highvolume and utilization lowcost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity 

hdd and nandflash product manufacturing is a complex process involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

a majority of our nandflash supply requirements for our nandflash products is obtained from our business ventures with toshiba which provide us with leadingedge highquality lowcost nandflash wafers this represents a captive supply and we are obligated to take our share of the output from these ventures or pay the fixed costs associated with that capacity see “ventures with toshiba” below for additional information while a majority of our flash memory supply utilized for our products is purchased from these ventures from timetotime we also purchase flash memory from other nandflash manufacturers which we refer to as noncaptive while we do not unilaterally control the operations of these ventures we believe that our business venture relationship with toshiba helps us to reduce the costs of producing our products increases our ability to control the quality of our products and speeds delivery of our products to our customers our vertically integrated manufacturing operations for our nandflash products are concentrated in three locations with our business ventures with toshiba located in yokkaichi japan and our inhouse assembly and test operations located in shanghai china and penang malaysia 

we also leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10‑k 

materials and supplies 

the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” the hda includes recording heads magnetic media head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner and a pivotarm module on which the head gimbal assemblies “hgas” including suspension are mounted each disk surface has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk other key components of our hard drives are preamps and voice coil magnets 

the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a power device that controls the motor and hsa positioner and a systemonchip “soc” comprised of a drive interface controller and recording channel the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the recording heads and magnetic media required for our products consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers we depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our hdd product design and manufacturing 

nandflash memory and controllers are the main components in our nandflash products a majority of our nandflash memory is primarily supplied by our business ventures with toshiba controllers are primarily designed inhouse and manufactured by thirdparty foundries or acquired from third party suppliers we believe the use of our inhouse assembly and test facilities as well as contract manufacturers provides flexibility and gives us access to increased production capacity we have developed deep relationships with these vendors and toshiba to establish continuous supply of nandflash memory and controllers 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for our component requirements but in some instances use sole or single sources for business or technology reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

ventures with toshiba 

we and toshiba currently operate three business ventures in 300millimeter nandflash manufacturing facilities in yokkaichi japan which provide us leadingedge costcompetitive nand wafers for our end products flash partners ltd which operates primarily in toshiba’s fab 3 facility “fab 3” was formed in september 2004 flash alliance ltd which operates primarily in toshiba’s fab 4 facility “fab 4” was formed in july 2006 flash forward ltd which operates primarily in toshiba’s fab 5 facility “fab 5” was formed in july 2010 we refer to flash partners flash alliance and flash forward collectively as flash ventures in addition we have a facility agreement with toshiba related to the construction and operation of toshiba’s “new fab 2” fabrication facility which is primarily intended to provide additional clean room space to convert a portion of existing 2d nand wafer capacity to 3d nand 

through flash ventures we and toshiba collaborate in the development and manufacture of nandflash wafers using semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by each of the flash venture entities we hold a 499 ownership position in each of the flash venture entities each flash venture entity purchases wafers from toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup we are committed to purchase half of flash ventures’ nand wafer supply or pay for half of flash ventures’ fixed costs regardless of the output we choose to purchase we are also committed to fund 499 to 50 of flash ventures’ investments to the extent that flash ventures’ operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments we and toshiba also collaborate on certain rd activities for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 72  79  and 80  of our net revenue for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and by providing information and support through our website in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale datacenter operators   system integrators and hyperscale customers who bundle embed or integrate our storage solutions purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations in addition we also sell directly to cloud infrastructure players as well as flash storage solutions to customers that offer our products under their own brand name in the retail market which we classify as oems for purposes of channel information 

distributors  we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and consumer electronics “ce” manufacturers dealers valueadded resellers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our websites 

for fiscal 2016  no  single customer accounted for 10  or more of our net revenue for both fiscal 2015  and 2014  hewlettpackard company accounted for 11  of our net revenue for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customers see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten years or more our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for additional information regarding our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action 

  for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

employees 

as of july 1 2016  we employed a total of 72878  employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs that we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement a majority of our employees in japan and china are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

corporate responsibility 

we believe that corporate social responsibility is an essential factor for our overall corporate success this includes adopting ethical and sustainable business practices to direct how we do business while keeping the interests of our stakeholders and the environment in focus 

we strive to uphold the following principles

 item 1a  risk factors 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties whether currently known or unknown any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or from anticipated future results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our common stock 

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole several factors contribute to these conditions and this uncertainty including but not limited to volatility in the equity credit and other financial markets and real estate markets slower growth in certain geographic regions lower levels of consumer liquidity risk of default on sovereign debt higher interest rates materials and component cost increases political uncertainty and other macroeconomic factors such as the june 23 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these conditions include the following 



integrating sandisk’s operations with ours may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the merger may not be realized 

the success of our recent acquisition of sandisk including anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and culture of sandisk into our company it is possible that the integration process will take longer than anticipated in addition the integration process could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs ongoing diversion of management attention the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors partners and employees if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated additionally the integration of sandisk’s operations into our operations may also increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective 

achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on our ability to integrate the business and operations of sandisk successfully and efficiently with our business the challenges involved in this integration which will be complex and timeconsuming include but are not limited to the following 

 if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business of the size and complexity of sandisk then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger and our revenue expenses operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the merger may have an adverse impact on our liquidity limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

in connection with the merger we substantially increased our indebtedness which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position as of july 1 2016 our total indebtedness was 175 billion  and we had 10 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility on april 13 2016 we issued 1875 billion  in senior secured notes and 335 billion  in senior unsecured notes we also entered into new senior credit facilities on april 29 2016 and an additional 30 billion bridge facility on may 12 2016 under which we have borrowed in the aggregate approximately 119 billion as of the date of this annual report on form 10k the proceeds from the notes issuance and new credit facilities were used to pay part of the purchase price for the merger refinance existing indebtedness of wd and sandisk and pay related transactionrelated fees and expenses on july 21 2016 we repaid the 30 billion  bridge facility in full on august 17 2016 we issued a new 30 billion  us dollardenominated term loan b1 in connection with this transaction we settled the previous us term loan b tranche with the proceeds of this new loan and a voluntary cash prepayment of 750 million  

our high level of debt could have significant consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

 in addition our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future 

we may from time to time seek to refinance the substantial indebtedness we incurred to finance the merger by issuing additional shares of our common stock in one or more securities offerings these securities offerings may dilute our existing shareholders reduce the value of our common stock or both because our decision to issue securities will depend on among other things market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of any future securities offerings thus holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings diluting and potentially reducing the value of our common stock 

if we are unable to successfully integrate the business and operations of hgst our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of hgst we agreed to certain conditions required by mofcom including adopting measures to keep hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agreed otherwise on october 19 2015 mofcom announced that it had made a decision allowing us to integrate substantial portions of our hgst and wd subsidiaries provided that we continue to offer both hgst and wd product brands and maintain separate sales teams that will separately offer products under the wd and hgst brands for two years from the date of the decision 

as a result of mofcom’s decision we immediately began planning for the integration of the substantial portions of our hgst and wd subsidiaries that we are now allowed to integrate including corporate functions rd recording heads and magnetic media operations engineering and manufacturing we expect this integration to continue through the end of calendar year 2017 our integration efforts during this time may involve significant management time and create uncertainty for employees and customers any delays in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the loss of customers the disruption of our company’s ongoing business or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated additionally the integration of the operations of our hgst and wdt subsidiaries may also increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective further until we are able to begin combining our hgst and wd product brands and sales teams on october 19 2017 we will continue to incur additional costs to maintain separate brands and sales teams these additional costs along with any delay in the integration process or higher than expected integration costs or other integration issues could adversely affect our ability to achieve the full operating expense synergies we expect from integration of the businesses of our hgst and wdt subsidiaries any failure to achieve the full operating expense synergies that we expect from this integration could harm our business and financial condition achieving these synergies is also subject to significant business operational economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies and we cannot assure you that any or all of these synergies will be achieved in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or cost expectations or at all 

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining average selling prices “asps” volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share all of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

demand for our devices software and solutions that we offer to our customers which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems including pcs and mobile devices manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period the price of nand flash memory is also influenced by among other factors the balance between supply and demand including the effects of new fab capacity in the industry macroeconomic factors business conditions technology transitions conversion of industry dram capacity to nand conversion of 2d nand capacity to 3d nand or other actions taken by us or our competitors the storage market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition if more intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could adversely impact revenue and gross margins in addition we compete based on our ability to offer our customers competitive solutions that provide the most current and desired product and service features we expect that competition will continue to be intense and there is a risk that our competitors’ products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of goods sold rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors along with others may also result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share all of which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture are based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply excess inventory and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

we experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

sales of computer systems mobile devices storage subsystems gaming consoles and consumer electronics “ce” tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

our sales to the ce cloud computing network attached storage nas surveillance systems and enterprise markets which have accounted for and may continue accounting for an increasing percentage of our overall revenue may grow at a slower rate than current estimates or not at all which could materially adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

the secular growth of digital data has resulted in a more diversified mix of revenue from the ce cloud computing nas surveillance systems and enterprise markets as sales into these markets have become a more significant portion of our revenue events or circumstances that adversely impact demand in these markets or our inability to address that demand successfully could materially adversely impact our operating results for example demand in or our sales to these markets may be adversely affected by the following 

 in addition demand in these areas also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management and the emergence of new technologies such as data duplication compression and storage virtualization if we are not able to respond appropriately these factors could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand for storage our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition furthermore our ability to accurately read and respond to market trends such as trends relating to the internet of things or big data could harm our results 

deterioration in the pc market may continue or accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer 

while sales to nonpc markets are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the pc market remain an important part of our business we believe that sales of pcs have declined due to fundamental changes in the pc market including the growth of alternative mobile devices and the lengthening of product life cycles and that further deterioration of the pc market may continue or accelerate which could cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer additionally if demand in the pc market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions or demand for our products in the pc market decreases at a faster rate than expected our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels we must successfully respond to the rapid change away from traditional advertising media marketing and sales methods to the use of internet media and advertising particularly social media and online sales or our brand and retail sales could be negatively affected adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd hgst™ or sandisk brand products our operating results may be adversely affected a significant portion of our sales is made through retailers and if our retailers are not successful in selling our products not only would our revenue decrease but we could also experience lower gross margin due to the return of unsold inventory or the protection we provide to retailers against price declines 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or if distribution markets for our products weaken our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected   negative changes in the creditworthiness or the ability to access credit or the bankruptcy or shutdown of any of our significant retail or distribution partners would harm our revenue and our ability to collect outstanding receivable balances 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the fiscal year ended july 1 2016 43  of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results and financial condition would likely be harmed 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as mobile social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

expansion into new markets may increase the complexity of our business cause us to increase our rd expenses to develop new products and technologies or cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

to remain a significant supplier in the storage industry and to expand into new markets we will need to offer a broader range of storage products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch and 25inch hard drives solid state drives and systems flash storage solutions and other products for the pc mobile enterprise data center and other storage markets as we expand our product lines to sell into new markets such as our recent entry into active archive systems and new flash memory business through the merger including the vertically integrated business model through flash ventures the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and we may become subject to different market dynamics these dynamics may include among other things different demand volume cyclicality seasonality product requirements sales channels and warranty and return policies in addition expansion into other markets may result in increases in rd expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability technology enhancements and gotomarket capability flash ventures requires significant investments by both toshiba and us for technology transitions including the transition to 3d nand and capacity expansions if we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors or new entrants who offer these products 

our vertical integration of recording head and magnetic media manufacturing makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop recording heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality increasing capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks for our business 

we develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the recording heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we produce consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of recording head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for recording heads and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of recording heads and magnetic media we may be unsuccessful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing recording heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our recording head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the recording heads or magnetic media we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop recording heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition as a result of our vertical integration of recording heads and magnetic media manufacturing we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our recording head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves in addition as a result of adverse labor rates or availability we may be required to increase investments in automation which may cause our capital expenditures to increase if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our recording head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

we make significant investments in rd to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments or investments that are not cost effective could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a leading supplier of hard drives and flash storage solutions we make significant investments to maintain our existing products and to lead innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in rd in addition we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model in order to remain competitive or as a result of the merger with sandisk which has historically maintained higher levels of investment in rd than our company the current inherent physical limitations associated with storage technologies are resulting in more costly capital expenditures that reduce the cost benefits of technology transitions and could limit our ability to keep pace with reductions in asps these investments may not result in viable technologies or products and even if they do result in viable technologies or products they may not be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful or costineffective rd efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in price capacity performance reliability serviceability industry standards or formats brand and marketing or other attributes a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is also critical to the success of our business we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage the chinese government and various agencies stateowned or affiliated enterprises and investment funds are making significant investments to promote china’s domestic semiconductor industry consistent with the government’s stated national policy objectives if we are unable to effectively compete with any manufacturers located in china or nonchinese competitors benefitting from alliances with chinese companies in the markets where we compete our operating results and financial condition will suffer 

consolidation within the data storage industry could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

the data storage industry as a whole has experienced consolidation over the past several years through acquisitions mergers and decisions by industry players to exit the industry consolidation across the industry including by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside of storage products may over extended periods of time sell storage products at prices that we cannot profitably match 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside of storage products because they do not depend solely on sales of storage products to achieve profitability they may sell storage products at lower prices and operate their storage business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonstorage products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their storage products at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

if we fail to qualify our products and achieve design wins with our customers it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers and the product qualification process may be lengthy for some customers including those in enterprise storage once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems and hyperscale customers which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures even if our products meet customer specifications our sales to these customers are dependent upon the customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products in sufficient volume our ability to supply our products in sufficient quantity and in a timely manner and with respect to oem partners the oems’ ability to create market and successfully sell products containing our solutions moreover in transitioning to new technologies such as 3d nand and products we may not achieve design wins our customers may delay transition to these new technologies our competitors may transition more quickly than we do or we may experience product delays cost overruns or performance issues that could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to risks related to product defects or the unintended use or security breaches of our products which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated litigation or indemnification claims 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition product defects product recalls or epidemic failures may cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships lost revenue indemnification for a recall of our customers’ products warranty claims litigation or loss of market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provision do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

certain of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third party content and usergenerated data stored on our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by hurting our reputation requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects and expose us to litigation and indemnification claims 

in addition thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate or use in our products may contain defects in design or manufacturing that could unexpectedly result in epidemic failures and subject us to liability 

we rely substantially on our business ventures and strategic partnerships with toshiba for the supply of nand flash memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on flash ventures and other strategic relationships with toshiba for our nand flash memory supply and therefore our business financial condition and operating results and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the merger will be dependent on the success of flash ventures and other strategic relationships with toshiba 

a majority of our nand flash memory is supplied by flash ventures which limits our ability to respond to demand and supply changes a failure to accurately forecast demand could cause us to overinvest or underinvest in technology transitions or the expansion of captive memory capacity in flash ventures overinvestment could result in excess supply which could cause significant decreases in our product prices significant excess obsolete or lower of cost or net realizable value inventory writedowns or underutilization charges and the potential impairment of our investments in flash ventures on the other hand if we or toshiba underinvest in captive memory capacity or technology transitions if we grow capacity more slowly than the rest of the industry if our technology transitions do not occur on the timeline that we expect if we encounter unanticipated difficulties in implementing these transitions or if we implement technology transitions more slowly than our competitors we may not have enough captive supply of the right type of memory or at all to meet demand on a timely and cost effective basis and we may lose opportunities for revenue and share as a result if our nand memory supply is limited we may make strategic decisions with respect to the allocation of our supply among our products and customers and these strategic allocation decisions may result in less favorable gross margin in the short term or damage certain customer relationships growth of our nand flash memory bit supply at a slower rate than the overall industry for an extended period of time would result in lowering our share which could limit our future opportunities and harm our financial results we are also contractually obligated to pay for 50 of the fixed costs of flash ventures regardless of whether we purchase any wafers from flash ventures furthermore purchase orders placed with flash ventures and under the foundry arrangements with toshiba for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled therefore once our purchase decisions have been made our production costs for flash memory are fixed and we may be unable to reduce costs to match any subsequent declines in pricing or demand which would harm our gross margin our limited ability to react to fluctuations in flash memory supply and demand makes our financial results particularly susceptible to variations from our forecasts and expectations 

in addition we partner with toshiba on the development of nand flash technology sandisk has entered into strategic partnerships with toshiba relating to rd for the next technology transitions of nand flash and alternative technologies beyond nand flash technologies 

these ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could harm the value of our investments our revenue and costs our future rate of spending our technology plans and our future growth opportunities under the terms of sandisk’s venture agreements with toshiba which govern the operations of flash ventures we have limited power to unilaterally direct most of the activities that most significantly impact flash ventures’ performance although sandisk and toshiba have a long history of aligning on important manufacturing and technology development decisions the integration of sandisk into our organization could complicate the process of reaching agreement with toshiba in a timely and favorable manner we may not always agree with toshiba on the nand rd roadmap the technology path beyond nand flash memory or expansions or conversions of production capacity a change in the management or control of toshiba’s storage business could lead to delays in decisionmaking or changes in strategic direction that could also adversely impact flash ventures in addition toshiba’s financial position or shift in strategic priorities could adversely impact our business 

flash ventures requires significant investments by both toshiba and us for technology transitions including the transition to 3d nand and capacity expansions in march 2016 toshiba announced plans to construct a new wafer fab in yokkaichi japan to provide additional cleanroom space for expanded 3d nand production although we intend to extend the joint venture partnership with toshiba to the new wafer fab there is no certainty as to when and on what terms we will participate with toshiba in any investment in or use of the new wafer fab if at all failure to extend the joint venture partnership or failure to continue to secure and invest in additional cleanroom space to support the continued 3d nand transition could adversely impact our supply of captive nand flash memory and financial results if toshiba does not or we do not provide sufficient resources or have adequate access to credit these investments could be delayed or reduced in addition in the event that lease financings for flash ventures are not available on favorable terms or at all more cash would be required to fund these investments 

our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have entered into strategic relationships with various partners for future product development sales growth and the supply of technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing including our relationships with toshiba for nand flash memory supply in addition in november 2015 we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with unis to market and sell our current data center storage systems in china and to develop data storage systems for the chinese market in the future the joint venture is 49 owned by us and 51 owned by unis and its subsidiary unissoft wuxi group co ltd please see the risk factor entitled “ because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for components subassemblies equipment consumables raw materials and logistics a supplier’s inability unwillingness or failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us can adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results ” for a further description of the risks associated with our reliance on external suppliers these strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations and financial condition these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 if our strategic relationships are unsuccessful or there are unanticipated changes in or termination of our strategic relationships our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for components subassemblies testing equipment consumables raw materials and logistics a supplier’s inability unwillingness or failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us can adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results 

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware controller components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on suppliers for a portion of our wafer testing chip assembly product assembly and product testing and on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our justintime hubs distribution centers and freight from suppliers to our factories and from our factories to our customers throughout the world many of the components and much of the equipment we acquire must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products technology and equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently our supply base has experienced industry consolidation where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation is enhanced any disruption in our supply chain could reduce our revenue and adversely impact our financial results 

from time to time our suppliers have experienced difficulty meeting our requirements if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers or qualify and engage additional suppliers we may not be able to meet demand for our products we do not have longterm contracts with some of our existing suppliers nor do we always have guaranteed manufacturing capacity with our suppliers and therefore we cannot guarantee that they will devote sufficient resources or capacity to manufacturing our products we are not able to directly control product delivery schedules or quality assurance furthermore we manufacture on a turnkey basis with some of our suppliers in these arrangements we do not have visibility and control of our suppliers’ inventories of purchased parts necessary to build our products or of the progress of our products through their assembly line any significant problems that occur at our suppliers or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems either of which would harm our operating results and financial condition in addition if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities from our current suppliers we may not be able to engage alternative suppliers who are able or willing to provide goods or services in sufficient quantities or at a cost acceptable to us 

our products require controllers and firmware we rely on a limited number of thirdparty vendors to develop or supply controllers for many of our highvalue solutions any delays or cost increases in developing or sourcing controllers or firmware or incompatibility or quality issues relating to the controllers or firmware in our products could harm our financial results as well as business relationships with our customers 

a majority of our flash memory is currently supplied by flash ventures and to a much lesser extent by thirdparty silicon suppliers any disruption or shortage in supply of flash memory from our captive or noncaptive sources would harm our operating results and financial condition many of the risks that affect us also affect our supply base and flash ventures including but not limited to having single site manufacturing locations and other facilities based in high risk regions of the world for example flash ventures is located in yokkaichi japan natural disasters power shortages macro and local economic conditions shortages of commodity materials proper management of technology transitions geopolitical risks employee strikes and other labor actions compliance with legal requirements financial instability and exposure to intellectual property “ip” and other litigation including an injunction or other action that could delay shipping if any of these risks were to affect our suppliers or flash ventures we could also be adversely affected especially in the case of products components or services that are singlesourced for example if suppliers are facing increased costs due to the above risks they may require us to enter into longterm volume agreements to shift the burden of fixed costs to us further we work closely with many of our suppliers and strategic partners to develop new technologies and as a result we may become subject to litigation from our suppliers strategic partners or third parties 

without a capable and financially stable supply base that has established appropriate relationships within the supply chain and has implemented business processes strategies and risk management safeguards we would be unable to develop our products manufacture them in high volumes and distribute them to our customers to execute our business plans effectively some of our suppliers have also experienced a decline in financial performance our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors consolidate or decide to exit the industry redirect their investments and increase costs to us each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition moving to new technologies may require us to align to and build a new supply base our success in new product areas may be dependent on our ability to develop close relationships with new suppliers with preferential agreements where this cannot be done our business and operations may be adversely affected 

in addition to an external supply base we also rely on an internal supply chain of heads media and media substrate and we rely on our business ventures with toshiba for the supply of nand flash memory please see the risk factors entitled “ a fundamental change in storage technologies and standards could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage” “if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected” and “we rely substantially on our business ventures and strategic partnerships with toshiba for the supply of nand flash memory which subjects us to risks and uncertainties that could harm our business financial condition and operating results” for a review of some of the risks related to these supplies 

price volatility shortages of critical materials or components or use by other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry may negatively impact our operating results 

increases in the cost for certain critical materials and components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting our products and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers shortages of critical components such as dram and nand flash or materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of uncertain global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire or keep pace with asp reduction which could harm our operating results in addition if our customers choose to delay transition to new technologies if demand for the products that we develop is lower than expected or if the supporting technologies to implement these new technologies are not available we may be unable to achieve the cost structure required to support our profit objectives or may be unable to grow or maintain our market position 

for example as 2d nand technology reaches its limits of cost effective technology scaling our successful development of 3d nand and alternative technologies such as 3d reram and transitioning our customers to these technologies in a timely and effective manner are crucial to continuing the cost reductions necessary to maintain adequate gross margin in transitioning our 2d nand manufacturing capacity to 3d nand technology we could experience delays or other challenges in the production ramp qualification of wafers shipment of samples to customers or customer approval process 3d nand and any new manufacturing node may be more susceptible to manufacturing yield issues manufacturing yield issues may not be identified during the development or production process or solved until an actual product is manufactured and tested further increasing our costs if our technology transitions including the production ramp of 3d nand technology take longer are more costly to complete than anticipated or do not improve manufacturing yield or other manufacturing efficiencies our flash memory costs may not remain competitive with other nand flash memory producers or may not fall commensurate with declines in the price of nand flash memory which would harm revenues our gross margin and operating results 

many companies including some of our competitors have developed or are attempting to develop alternative nonvolatile technologies successful broadbased commercialization of one or more competing technologies as well as differing strategies and timing with respect to the transition from 2d nand to 3d nand could reduce the competitiveness and future revenue and profitability of our 2d nand and 3d nand flash technologies and the potential 3d reram technology that we are developing with our partners in addition we generate license and royalty revenue from nand flash technology and if nand flash technology is replaced by a technology where our ip is less relevant our license and royalty revenue would decrease also we may not have access to alternative technologies that we do not develop internally and we may have to pay royalties in order to access such technologies 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product longer product life cycles could also restrict our ability to transition customers to our newer products in a timely manner or at all negatively impacting our ability to recoup our significant rd investments to improve our existing technology and develop new technologies if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

a fundamental change in storage technologies and standards could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in storage technologies or standards any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology or standard fails to remain competitive there are some revolutionary technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic recording heatassisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition many companies including some of our competitors have developed or are attempting to develop alternative nonvolatile technologies including nonnand technologies such as magnetorestitive ram reram 3d xpoint phase change and memristor as well as nand based vertical or stacked 3d memories based on charge trap floating gate and other cell architecture in embedded solutions certain competitors have recently introduced a mobile storage standard referred to as universal flash storage or ufs and in the datacenter market certain competitors have recently introduced a nonvolatile memory express or nvme product that can be used as a substitute for our pcie solutions as a result of these shifts in technology and standards we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as recording heads magnetic media and tools in adopting new standards or in investing in different capital equipment or manufacturing processes to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or standards or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies or standards we may not be able to offer products with capacities and capabilities that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter higher areal densities require existing recording head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however increasing areal density has become more difficult in the storage industry if we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to include more components in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new test equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gigabytes per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

our license and royalty revenue may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future due to license agreement expirations or renewals declines in sales of the products or use of technology underlying the license and royalty revenue by our licensees or if licensees fail to perform on a portion or all of their contractual obligations 

if our existing licensees do not renew their licenses upon expiration renew or sign new agreements on less favorable terms exercise their option to terminate the license or fail to exercise their option to extend the licenses or we are not successful in signing new licensees in the future our license revenue profitability and cash provided by operating activities would be harmed and we may incur significant patent litigation costs to enforce our patents against these licensees as our older patents expire and the coverage of our newer patents may be different it may be more difficult to negotiate or renew favorable license agreement terms or a license agreement at all our 2009 license agreement with samsung expired on august 14 2016 if we are unable to negotiate a new agreement or if we negotiate a new agreement on less favorable terms such as a lower effective royalty rate compared to the expired license agreement we will experience a decrease in license and royalty revenue our agreements may require us in certain instances to recognize license revenue related to a particular licensee all in one period instead of over time which could create additional volatility in our licensing revenue a portion of our license and royalty revenue is based on sales of product categories as well as the underlying technology and fluctuations in the sales of those products or technology adoption rates would also result in fluctuations in the license and royalty revenue due to us under our agreements if our licensees or we fail to perform on contractual obligations we may incur costs to enforce or defend the terms of our licenses and there can be no assurance that our enforcement defense or collection efforts will be effective if we license new ip from third parties or existing licensees we may be required to pay license fees royalty payments or offset existing license revenue we may enter into agreements with customers suppliers or partners that could limit our ability to monetize our ip or could result in us being required to provide ip indemnification to our customers suppliers or partners in addition we may be subject to disputes claims or other disagreements on the timing amount or collection of royalties or license payments under our license agreements 

if we do not properly manage new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with technology advancements advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in other emerging technologies that can be competitive with traditional storage technologies we may be unsuccessful in anticipating and developing new and improved products for the client enterprise and other storage markets in response to competing technologies if our hard drive solid state products and our storage solutions products fail to offer a superior value proposition to alternative storage products we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our business will suffer in some cases our customers’ demand for a more diversified portfolio results in investments in new products for a particular market that do not necessarily expand overall market opportunity which may negatively affect our operating results as we introduce new products standards or technologies it can take time for these new standards or technologies to be adopted for consumers to accept and transition to these new standards or technologies and for significant sales to be generated if at all failure of consumers or enterprises to adopt our new products standards or technologies could harm our results of operations as we fail to reap the benefits of our investments 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

 in particular as part of our growth strategy we have made significant investments in active archive systems which are designed to enable organizations to rapidly access massive longterm data stores for example our acquisition of amplidata was partially driven by our strategy to expand in this area we expect to continue to make significant investments in active archive systems our active archive systems may fail to gain market acceptance or the market for active archive systems may not grow as we anticipate 

we  have also seen and anticipate continuing to see an increase in customers requesting that we develop products including software associated with our products that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment adapting to this demand may cause product delays placing us at a competitive disadvantage open source products could also reduce our capability for product differentiation or innovation and our affected products could be diminished to commodity status which we expect would place increased downward pressure on our margins if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage issues associated with our product development generally our business may suffer 

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the concentration of flash ventures in yokkaichi japan magnifies the risks of supply disruption the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’ other suppliers such as the spread of a pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of our products that we are able to manufacture or sell which would result in substantial harm to our operating results similarly a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities including access to or from these facilities by employees or logistics operators would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results for example prior to the 2011 flooding in thailand all of wds internal slider capacity and 60 of wds hard drive manufacturing capacity was in thailand as a result of the flooding in thailand wds facilities were inundated and temporarily shut down during that period wds ability to manufacture hard drives was significantly constrained adversely affecting wds business financial condition and results of operations in addition the concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from localized labor unrest or other employment issues a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

we may incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the scope of the coverage of our insurance policies there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain existing insurance coverage or that premiums will not increase substantially due to market availability pricing or other reasons we may elect not to purchase insurance coverage or to purchase only limited coverage we maintain limited insurance coverage and in some cases no coverage at all for natural disasters and environmental damages as these types of insurance are sometimes not available or available only at a prohibitive cost we depend upon toshiba to obtain and maintain sufficient property business interruption and other insurance for flash ventures if toshiba fails to do so we could suffer significant unreimbursable losses and such failure could also cause flash ventures to breach various financing covenants 

manufacturing marketing and selling our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

currently a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations and many of our products and components are produced overseas our revenue and future growth is significantly dependent on the growth of international markets and we may face difficulties in entering or maintaining international sales markets we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing and sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of and reliance on contract manufacturers including 



 as a result of these risks our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

recent terrorist incidents around the world and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we our suppliers or our customers operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities rd activities including our operations in israel or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected any of these events could also increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could have a negative effect on our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers or adversely affect consumer confidence 

sudden disruptions to the availability of air transportation or ocean or land freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of air transportation cargo operations or ocean rail or truck freight lanes caused by among other things labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently receive shipments from our suppliers or deliver our products 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems security vulnerabilities or design defects or sustain system failures our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors and partners may also experience such attacks cyber attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities our products are also targets for cyber attacks while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers we have agreed with certain customers and strategic partners including toshiba to undertake certain commitments to promote information security and we may be liable to toshiba or such other parties if we fail to meet our cyber security commitments 

in addition our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures further our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information ip or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result we could experience additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions which are a key part of our growth strategy it may adversely affect our future results 

we seek to be an industryleading developer manufacturer and provider of innovative storage solutions balancing our core hard drive and flash memory business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy for example we have completed the acquisitions of sandisk in may 2016 amplidata in march 2015 virident systems inc in october 2013 and stec inc in september 2013 in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions we are also subject to certain covenants in our debt agreements which place limits on our ability to complete acquisitions and investments even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition acquisitions and investments may also result in the issuance of equity securities that may be dilutive to our stockholders and the issuance of additional indebtedness which would put additional pressure on liquidity furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of our key executive management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees including employees from acquisitions and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we lose our existing key management staff or skilled employees or are unable to hire and integrate new key management staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key management or staff our operating results would likely be harmed furthermore if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our intended realignment after we make decisions regarding our personnel and implement our realignment plans our operating results could be adversely affected 

we and certain of our officers are at times involved in litigation including ip antitrust and securities litigation which may be costly may divert the efforts of our key personnel and could result in adverse court rulings which could materially harm our business 

we are involved in litigation including cases involving our ip rights and those of others antitrust and commercial matters putative securities class action suits and other actions we are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others some of the actions seek injunctive relief including injunctions against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and operating results 

litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations if we receive an adverse judgment in any litigation we could be required to pay substantial damages and cease certain practices or activities including the manufacture use and sale of products with or without merit litigation can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can be very expensive and the expense can be unpredictable litigation initiated by us could also result in counterclaims against us which could increase the costs associated with the litigation and result in our payment of damages or other judgments against us in addition litigation and any related publicity may divert the efforts and attention of some of our key personnel litigation may also harm the market prices of our securities 

we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation or regulatory investigations these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the costs of defending lawsuits against these individuals the cost of defending stockholder derivative suits the cost of governmental law enforcement or regulatory investigations civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measures if any which may be imposed 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use sharing and security of thirdparty data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm  

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data and employee data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers customers and partners to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other ip rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we have historically been involved in frequent disputes regarding patent and other ip rights and we have in the past received and we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that certain of our products processes or technologies infringe upon their patent rights copyrights trademark rights or other ip rights we may also receive claims of potential infringement if we attempt to license ip to others ip risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no ip protection as a defense against litigation the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of ip litigation increase the ip risks we face litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may be subject to injunctions enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

if we incorporate thirdparty technology into our products or if claims or actions are asserted against us for alleged infringement of the ip of others we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers customers and partners are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier customer or partner could negatively impact our business 

moreover from time to time we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged ip infringement the scope of such indemnity varies but may include indemnification for direct and consequential damages and expenses including attorneys’ fees we may be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations third party claims for patent infringement are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies a future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

our reliance on ip and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable ip such as our process technology we primarily rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes there can be no assurance that our existing patents will continue to be held valid if challenged or that they will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us it is also possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our proprietary technologies and processes despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection there are entities whom we believe may infringe our ip enforcement of our rights often requires litigation if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us moreover the defendant in such an action may successfully countersue us for infringement of their patents or assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our ip to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of ip rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered ip rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

the success of our branded products depends in part on the positive image that consumers have of our brands we believe the popularity of our brands makes them a target of counterfeiting or imitation with third parties attempting to pass off counterfeit products as our products any occurrence of counterfeiting imitation or confusion with our brands could adversely affect our reputation and impair the value of our brands which in turn could negatively impact sales of our branded products our share and our gross margin as well as increase our administrative costs related to brand protection and counterfeit detection and prosecution 

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the electronics industry citizenship coalition could cause an increase in our operating costs 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our suppliers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which would have a materially adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the electronics industry citizenship coalition the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition and operating results to suffer 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain components and metals contained in our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted rules establishing diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use and source of gold tantalum tin and tungsten commonly referred to as 3tg or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies these rules require us to determine and report annually whether such 3tg originated from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain 3tg or 3tg generally at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of such components or 3tg since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” 3tg our customers including our oem customers may require and some of our customers have notified us that they require that our products contain only conflict free 3tg and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement additionally we may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders and challenges from government regulators if our products are not conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the 3tg contained in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we could incur significant costs to the extent that we are required to make changes to products processes or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures to the extent that conflict minerals legislation is adopted by the european commission canada or any other jurisdiction these risks could increase 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers customers or partners could harm our business 

we expect our suppliers customers and partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers customers partners or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of them or divergence of their business practices from those generally accepted as ethical could harm our business by 

 because of high debt levels we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms 

as of july 1 2016 our total indebtedness was 175 billion and we had 10 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility our ability to meet our expense and debt service obligations contained in our debt agreements will depend on our available cash and our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors including potential changes in laws or regulations industry conditions industry supply and demand balance customer preferences the success of our products and pressure from competitors if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or should we fail to comply with our financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities we may not be able to at any given time refinance our debt sell assets incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to us in amounts sufficient to meet our needs or at all if we are able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities such issuance would also result in dilution to our shareholders our inability to service our debt obligations or refinance our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition our debt obligations may limit our ability to make required investments in capacity technology or other areas of our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness the holder of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 

the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies and could adversely affect our capital resources financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests including among other things restrictions on our ability to 

 due to these restrictions we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate our business during general economic or business downturns and we may be unable to compete effectively or take advantage of new opportunities to grow our business in addition our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet them the indebtedness and these restrictive covenants may have the effect among other things of limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions 

a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in us having to repay our borrowings or repay our notes before their due dates such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt leases or other obligations to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies if we are forced to refinance these borrowings or our notes on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity our results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected in addition an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities and our senior secured notes those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

flash ventures’ equipment lease agreements contain covenants and other cancellation events and cancellation of the leases would harm our business operating results and financial condition 

flash ventures sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions “lessors” a portion of its equipment and flash ventures has entered into equipment lease agreements of which we and toshiba each guarantee half of the total outstanding obligations as of july 1 2016 the portion of outstanding flash ventures’ lease obligations covered by our guarantees totaled approximately 115 billion based upon the exchange rate at july 1 2016 the equipment lease agreements contain covenants and cancellation events that are customary for japanese lease facilities and that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors cancellation events relating to the guarantors include among other things an assignment of all or a substantial part of a guarantor’s business acceleration of other monetary debts of a guarantor above a specified threshold and certain financial covenants 

the breach of a covenant or the occurrence of another cancellation event could result in an acceleration of the flash ventures’ lease obligations if a cancellation event were to occur flash ventures would be required to negotiate a resolution with the lessors as well as other parties to the lease transactions to avoid cancellation and acceleration of the lease obligations such resolution could include among other things supplementary security to be supplied by us as guarantor increased interest rates or waiver fees if a cancellation event occurs and we fail to reach a resolution we may be required to pay all or a portion of the outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantees which would significantly reduce our cash position and may force us to seek additional financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 

any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue cost of goods sold margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin in addition our purchases of nand flash memory from flash ventures and our investment in flash ventures are denominated in japanese yen if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar our cost of purchasing nand flash wafers and the cost to us of future funding of flash ventures would increase and the value of our investments denominated in japanese yen would be higher increasing our exposure to asset impairment if any of these events occur they would have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the united states fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the united states 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place thus our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful and harm our operating results further the ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions is based upon our available credit from such institutions and compliance with covenants and other restrictions operating losses third party downgrades of our credit rating or instability in the worldwide financial markets could impact our ability to effectively manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk hedging also exposes us to the credit risk of our counterparty financial institutions 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 



 we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 in addition changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

the resale of shares of common stock issued to hitachi in connection with our acquisition of hgst could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

on march 8 2012 as partial consideration for our acquisition of hgst we issued 25 million shares of our common stock to hitachi on each of november 6 2013 and november 13 2014 hitachi completed a secondary offering of 125 million and 625 million respectively of these shares future sales of the remaining 625 million shares of our common stock held by hitachi could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our cash balances and investment portfolio are subject to various risks any of which could adversely impact our financial position 

given the international footprint of our business we have both domestic and international cash balances and investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings security types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market political sovereign and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a material part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities and bank deposits if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that our investments may experience an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could also have an adverse impact on our financial position 

in addition i f we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to repay our indebtedness fund acquisitions pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock we may choose or be required to increase our borrowings if available or to repatriate funds to the united states at a substantial tax cost 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our stock price may be adversely affected 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 1 2016 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting in future periods investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements we may be required to restate our financial results our access to capital markets may be limited and we may be subject to sanctions from regulatory agencies and the nasdaq global select market each of which may adversely affect our stock price 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax examinations or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received a revenue agent’s report seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with loss or nonrenewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met although many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met we may not be able to meet such conditions if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future in addition any actions by us to repatriate nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes may impact our effective tax rate 

changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws and regulations are passed and new interpretations of the laws are issued or applied the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority and certain changes to the us tax laws and regulations have been proposed in addition many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business due to the large scale of our us and international business activities many of these proposed changes to the taxation of our activities if enacted could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations

in connection with the regulatory approval process for the hgst acquisition which closed on march 8 2012 we agreed to certain conditions required by mofcom including adopting measures to maintain hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agreed otherwise accordingly since march 2012 we have operated our global business through two independent subsidiaries — hgst and wd in march 2014 we submitted an application to mofcom to lift the condition it imposed on us to operate these businesses separately on october 19 2015 mofcom issued a decision in response to our application that permits us to integrate our hgst and wd subsidiaries except that we committed to maintain two sales teams that will separately offer products under the wd or hgst brands for two years from the date of the decision 

we have initiated a set of actions relating to the restructuring plan associated with the integration of substantial portions of our hgst and wd subsidiaries the restructuring plan consists of asset and footprint reduction product roadmap consolidation and organization rationalization

results of operations 

fiscal 2016  overview 

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” operating results for sandisk and amplidata which we acquired on may 12 2016 and march 9 2015 respectively are included in our operating results only after the respective dates of acquisition 

in the course of finalizing this annual report on form 10k we determined it was necessary to record an additional 10 million  in rd expense primarily for third party nonrecurring engineering charges and 5 million  in asset impairment for the discontinuation of a software project for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016 that were not included in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july 28 2016 to announce our preliminary and unaudited financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended july 1 2016 given this change for fiscal year 2016 operating income decreased to 466 million  and net income decreased to 242 million  or 100  per diluted share and for the fourth quarter of 2016 operating loss increased to 195 million  and net loss increased to 366 million  or 140  per diluted share 

the following is a summary of our financial performance for fiscal 2016  



 summary comparison of 2016  2015  and 2014 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue 



the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding unit shipments asps and net revenues by geography and channel 







fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015 

net revenue   

net revenue was 130 billion  for 2016  a decrease  of 11  from the prior year primarily due to lower hdd unit shipments partially offset by an increase in hdd asp and revenues from sandisk of 793 million  following may 12 2016 the closing date of the merger the “sandisk closing date” total hdd shipments for 2016   decreased  to 185 million  units as compared to 229 million  units in the prior year primarily due to a softer demand environment asps were 61  for 2016  an increase  of 1  from 2015  primarily due to a change in product mix 

changes in net revenue by geography reflect a 

 consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2016  and 2015  these programs represented 13  and 10  of gross revenues respectively these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue 

gross profit 

gross profit for 2016  was 34 billion  a decrease  of 786 million  from the prior year gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased  to 264  in 2016  as compared to 290  in the prior year this decrease  was primarily the result of lower hdd unit sales and the related absorption impact and accelerated depreciation on assets related to both the closure of the odawara japan facility and the restructuring plan this decrease in gross profit was partially offset by sandisk’s gross profit following the sandisk closing date 

operating expenses 

rd expense was 16 billion  in 2016  a decrease  of 19 million  or 1  from the prior year this decrease  was primarily the result of reductions in employee compensation expenses due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our business realignment initiatives reduction in material spend due to the consolidation of our product roadmap in relation to the integration of our hgst and wd subsidiaries and an additional week in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by sandisk’s rd expenses following the sandisk closing date and expenses related to the integration of our hgst and wd subsidiaries 

selling general and administrative “sga” expense was 997 million  in 2016  an increase  of 209 million  or 27  from the prior year this increase  was primarily the result of sandisk’s sga expenses following the sandisk closing date charges related to the merger and expenses related to the integration of our hgst and wd subsidiaries these charges were partially offset by a reduction in employee compensation expenses due to a reduction in headcount as a result of our business realignment initiatives and an additional week in the prior year 

during 2016  we recorded 345 million  of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 251 million  of employee termination costs 37 million  of asset impairment charges and 57 million  of contract termination and other charges during 2015  we recorded 176 million  of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 82 million  of employee termination costs 82 million  of asset impairment charges and 12 million  of contract termination and other charges for additional information see part ii item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

other income expense 

total other expense net was 313 million  in 2016  as compared to 34 million  in the prior year interest income increased  to 26 million  in 2016  from 14 million  in the prior year primarily due to a higher average daily invested cash balance and higher market interest rates interest expense increased  to 266 million  in 2016  from 49 million  in the prior year primarily due to a higher debt balance and amortization of issuance costs related to the debt issued in connection with the merger other income expense net was 73 million  of expense primarily comprised of settlement of the sandisk debt instruments and the writeoff of debt issuance costs related to the termination of our existing credit agreement for additional information on debt see part ii item 8 note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10‑k 

income tax expense benefit 

income tax benefit was 89 million  in 2016  as compared to a 112 million  expense in the prior year tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes was 582  in 2016  as compared to tax expense of 71  in the prior year our income tax benefit for 2016  reflects tax benefits from expenses related to the merger and from interest expense related to new debt facilities the difference between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign income taxed at lower tax rates due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2016 through 2029 the current year generation of income tax credits and the tax deductible expenses related to the merger 

as of july 1 2016  we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 491 million  we recognized a net increase of 141 million  in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2016  accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of july 1 2016  was 75 million  120 million  of the net increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is attributable to balances assumed as a result of the merger 

the internal revenue service “irs” previously completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 and proposed certain adjustments we have received revenue agent reports from the irs that seek to increase our us taxable income which would result in additional federal tax expense totaling 795 million  subject to interest the issues in dispute relate primarily to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and intercompany payable balances we disagree with the proposed adjustments and in september 2015 filed a protest with the irs appeals office and received the irs rebuttal in july 2016 we believe that our tax positions are properly supported and will vigorously contest the position taken by the irs in september 2015 the irs commenced an examination of our fiscal years 2010 through 2012 

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax examinations are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of july 1 2016  it is not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months any significant change in the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns 

fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014 

net revenue   

net revenue was 146 billion for 2015 a decrease of 4 from 2014 the decrease was primarily due to a 8 decline in total hdd shipments partially offset by an increase in asps total hdd shipments in 2015 decreased to 229 million units as compared to 249 million units for the prior year primarily due to a decrease in client pc demand asps were 60 for 2015 an increase of 2 from 2014 primarily due to a change in product mix 

changes in net revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2015 and 2014 these programs represented 10 and 8 of gross revenues respectively these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products 

gross profit   

gross profit for 2015 was 42 billion a decrease of 139 million from the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower volume gross profit as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat at 290 in 2015 as compared to 288 in 2014 

operating expenses 

rd expense was 16 billion in 2015 a decrease of 15 million or 1 over the prior year this slight decrease was due primarily to lower incentive compensation partially offset by an additional week in fiscal 2015 and additional expenses related to our acquisitions 

sga expense was 788 million in 2015 a decrease of 25 million  or 3  as compared to 2014 adjusting for a 37 million floodrelated insurance recovery in 2015 compared to a 65 million floodrelated insurance recovery in 2014 and legal charges of 15 million  in 2015 compared to 52 million  in 2014 related to a litigation matter that is now closed sga expense decreased   16 million  or 2  compared to 2014 this slight decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation partially offset by an additional week in fiscal 2015 and additional expenses related to our acquisitions 

during 2015 we recorded 176 million of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 82 million of employee termination costs 82 million of asset impairment charges and 12 million of contract termination and other charges during 2014 we recorded 95 million of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 27 million of employee termination costs 62 million of asset impairment charges and 6 million of contract termination and other charges 

other income expense 

other expense net was 34 million in 2015 compared to 39 million in 2014 interest income decreased to 14 million in 2015 from 15 million in 2014 primarily due to a 3 million gain on the sale of our auctionrate securities in 2014 interest expense decreased to 49 million in 2015 from 56 million in 2014 primarily due to a 4 million writeoff of debt issuance costs in 2014 

income tax provision 

income tax expense was 112 million in 2015 as compared to 135 million in 2014 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 71 in 2015 as compared to 77 in 2014 our income tax provision for 2015 reflects a tax benefit of 27 million as a result of the retroactive extension of the us federal research and development tax credit that was signed into law on december 19 2014 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2016 through 2025 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

we ended 2016  with total cash and cash equivalents of 82 billion  an increase  of 31 billion  from july 3 2015  the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended july 1 2016  



we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt dividend and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in part i item 1a in this annual report on form 10k 

in connection with the merger we entered into new debt facilities totaling 181 billion  which included notes with an aggregate principal amount of 52 billion  term loans of 89 billion  a revolving credit facility of 10 billion  and a bridge loan of 30 billion  as of july 1 2016  we had 170 billion in debt facilities outstanding net of debt issuance costs the proceeds from the new debt facilities were used to finance in part the cash portion of the purchase price related to the merger refinance certain existing indebtedness of western digital and sandisk and pay certain transaction costs on july 21 2016 the 30 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior secured bridge loan outstanding was repaid in full together with accrued interest on may 12 2016 we assumed sandisk’s outstanding 997 million  aggregate principal amount of its 2017 notes and 15 billion  aggregate principal amount of its 2020 notes after taking into account conversions and the amounts that we purchased as of august 26 2016  37 million  principal amount of the 2020 notes and an immaterial principal amount of the 2017 notes were outstanding for additional information on the debt entered into in connection with the merger see part ii item 8 note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

the cash on hand and indebtedness used to finance the merger could cause us to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital dividend and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans 

during 2017 we expect our total capital investment to be approximately 26 billion  to 30 billion  including our net capital investments in flash ventures and our investment in nonfab property and equipment we expect these 2017 investments to be funded by flash ventures’ working capital anticipated new equipment leases and approximately 10 billion  to 14 billion  of our cash 

a total of 69 billion  and 43 billion  of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the united states as of july 1 2016  and july 3 2015  respectively our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations or dividends to our shareholders pursuant to our quarterly cash dividend policy in the event funds from foreign operations are needed in the united states any repatriation could result in the accrual and payment of additional us income tax 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 20 billion  in 2016  as compared to 22 billion  and 28 billion  in 2015  and 2014  respectively cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash provided by working capital changes was 377 million  for 2016  as compared to 593 million  and 234 million  used for working capital changes in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the cash conversion cycles for the three years ended july 1 2016  were as follows 



in 2016  our days sales outstanding “dsos” increased  by 2  days days in inventory “dios” increased  by 32  days and days payables outstanding “dpos” increased  by 11  days as compared to the prior year these increases were primarily due to the impact of including sandisk’s accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable balances as of july 1 2016  but only including sandisk’s revenue and cost of sales following the sandisk closing date the merger increased dso dio and dpo by 12 days 32 days and 14 days respectively for 2016  the increase in dsos from the merger was largely offset by the linearity of shipments changes in dios are generally related to the timing of inventory builds changes in dpos are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2016  was 96 billion  as compared to 10 billion  and 19 billion  for 2015  and 2014  respectively during 2016  net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of 98 billion  related to the merger net of cash acquired 632 million  related to the purchase of investments 584 million  of capital expenditures 90 million net increase in notes receivable to flash ventures and a net 76 million  of other investing activities partially offset by 16 billion  of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments during 2015  net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of 857 million related to the purchase of investments 612 million of capital expenditures and 257 million related to acquisitions net of cash acquired partially offset by 768 million of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments during 2014  net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of 823 million  related to acquisitions net of cash acquired 628 million  of capital expenditures and 561 million  related to the purchase of investments partially offset by 72 million  of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments 

our cash equivalents are primarily invested in highly liquid money market funds that are invested in us treasury securities and us government agency securities in addition we invest directly in us treasury securities us and international government agency securities certificates of deposit assetbacked securities and corporate and municipal notes and bonds 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 108 billion  in 2016  as compared to net cash used of 11 billion  and 385 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively during 2016  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of 166 billion  of proceeds from debt net of issuance costs 409 million  of proceeds from call options 125 million  of proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and a net 74 million  provided by employee stock plans offset by 26 billion  to settle convertible debt 23 billion  to repay debt 613 million  for payment upon settlement of warrants 464 million  to pay dividends on our common stock 380 million  to repay the revolving credit facility and 60 million  to repurchase shares of our common stock during 2015  net cash used in financing activities consisted of 970 million to repurchase shares of our common stock 396 million to pay dividends on our common stock and 125 million to repay debt partially offset by 255 million of proceeds from our revolving credit facility and a net 167 million provided by employee stock plans during 2014  net cash used in financing activities consisted of 25 billion  used to repay debt 816 million  used to repurchase shares of our common stock and 259 million  used to pay dividends on our common stock partially offset by 30 billion  of proceeds from our term loan facility net of issuance costs and a net 215 million  provided by employee stock plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than the commitments related to flash ventures facility lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions see “contractual obligations and commitments” below we do not have any other material offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any other obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have an interest in or relationships with any specialpurpose entities for additional information regarding our offbalance sheet arrangements see part ii item 8 note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

flash ventures 

we are a 499  owner of each entity within flash ventures our business ventures with toshiba to develop and manufacture nand flash memory products these nand flash memory products are manufactured by toshiba at toshiba’s yokkaichi japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by flash ventures this equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to flash ventures from us and toshiba as well as through operating leases received by flash ventures from thirdparty banks and guaranteed by us and toshiba the entities within flash ventures purchase wafers from toshiba at cost and then resell those wafers to us and toshiba at cost plus a markup we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flash ventures’ nand wafer supply or pay for 50  of the fixed costs of flash ventures we are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers we are also committed to fund 499  to 50  of flash ventures’ investments to the extent that flash ventures’ operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments 

from timetotime we and toshiba mutually approve the purchase of equipment for flash ventures in order to convert to new process technologies or add wafer capacity flash partners’ share of fab 3 and flash alliance’s share of fab 4 have been previously equipped to full wafer capacity fab 5 which is primarily utilized by flash forward was built in two phases of approximately equal size phase 1 of fab 5 is fully equipped and the majority of phase 2 of fab 5 is equipped to date we have invested in approximately 50 of flash forward’s equipment and the output has been shared equally between us and toshiba toshiba’s most recent 300millimeter wafer fabrication facility located in yokkaichi japan “new fab 2” for which we have a facility agreement with toshiba is primarily intended to provide additional cleanroom space to convert a portion of 2d nand capacity to 3d nand we expect that the new fab 2 space will accommodate conversion of somewhat less than half of the current fab 3 fab 4 and fab 5 2d nand capacity to 3d nand production wafers in new fab 2 started in january 2016 

for semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is leased by flash ventures we and toshiba each guarantee on an unsecured and several basis 50 of the outstanding flash ventures’ lease obligations under lease agreements entered into by flash ventures these lease obligations are denominated in japanese yen and are noncancelable our lease obligation guarantees as of july 1 2016  which reflects future payments and any lease adjustments totaled 115 billion  based upon the exchange rate at july 1 2016  the lease agreements contain certain covenants and cancellation events that are customary for japanese lease facilities and that relate to flash ventures and each of the guarantors the breach of a covenant or the occurrence of another cancellation event could result in an acceleration of flash ventures’ lease obligations as of july 1 2016  we were in compliance with all covenants under these japanese lease facilities

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers containing minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

we have inventory purchase commitments with flash ventures to purchase flash ventures’ nand wafer supply purchase orders placed under flash ventures for up to three months are binding and cannot be canceled we also have contracts with our other sources of silicon wafers that generally require us to provide monthly purchase order commitments the purchase orders placed under these arrangements are generally binding and cannot be canceled these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to commitments 

foreign exchange contracts 

we purchase foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” and part ii item 8 notes 1 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements products or services to be provided by us environmental compliance or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements   

unrecognized tax benefits 

as of july 1 2016  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 566 million  of which 411 million  could result in potential cash payments we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax payments related to these obligations for additional information regarding our total tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits see part ii item 8 note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors previously authorized a stock repurchase program effective october 21 2015 in connection with the merger we suspended this stock repurchase program for additional information see part ii item 8 note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue and accounts receivable 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions andor a right of return and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection andor returns until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information historical and anticipated returns information and customer claim processing if customer demand for our products or market conditions differ from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 7  to 14  of gross revenue and adjustments to revenue due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenue reported in prior periods have generally averaged less than 1 of gross revenue over the last three fiscal years 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could materially affect operating results 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

warranty 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one  to five  years with a small number of products having a warranty ranging up to ten  years or more our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated replacement costs estimated repair costs which include scrap costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any for warranties ten years or greater including lifetime warranties we use the estimated useful life of the product to calculate the warranty exposure we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on product reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross profit and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions see part ii item 8 note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout or net realizable value we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates for additional information see part ii item 8 note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

stockbased compensation 

we account for all stockbased compensation at fair value stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan purchase rights are estimated using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model we account for stock appreciation rights “sars” as liability awards based upon our intention to settle such awards in cash the sars liability is recognized for that portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date the sharebased liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected performance restricted stock unit awards “psus” are subject to continued service by the employee and expense is recognized over the vesting period at each reporting date we evaluate the probability that psus will be earned we record stockbased compensation expense on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved 

business combinations 

the application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates in certain circumstances the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information including appraisals and other analysis accordingly the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information or the facts and circumstances becomes available but will not exceed twelve months we will recognize measurementperiod adjustments during the period of resolution including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date 

goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination we recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged either individually or in combination with a related contract asset or liability intangible assets consist primarily of technology customer relationships and trade name and trademarks acquired in business combinations and inprocess research and development “iprd” we generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques to estimate fair value we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions including future economic and market conditions revenue growth market share operating costs and margins and riskadjusted discount rates our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data various internal estimates and external sources our assessment of iprd also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we either use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired or we perform a twostep approach to quantify impairment if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to follow a twostep approach to quantify the impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit if our stock price decreases significantly goodwill could become impaired which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations 

acquired intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable iprd is not amortized until the point at which it reaches technological feasibility instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition see part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated by reference in response to this item 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes for additional information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

as of july 1 2016  we had outstanding the foreign exchange contracts presented in the following table the changes in fair values of these foreign exchange contracts would be largely offset in other income expense by corresponding changes in the fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 





 in 2016  2015  and 2014  total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 

disclosure about other market risks 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under our term loan a facility and our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor rate subject to a 00 floor plus an applicable margin of 20 or at a base rate plus an applicable margin of 100 beginning in september 2016 the applicable margin for the borrowings under our term loan a facility and our revolving credit facility will range depending on our leverage from 150 to 225 for libor loans and from 050 to 125 for base rate loans borrowings under the us term loan b tranche bear interest at a rate per annum at our option of either an adjusted libor rate subject to a 075 floor plus an applicable margin of 55 or at a base rate plus an applicable margin of 450 borrowings under the euro term loan b tranche bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an adjusted euribor rate subject to a 075 floor plus an applicable margin of 525 borrowings under our senior secured bridge credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to at our option either an adjusted libor rate subject to a 00 floor plus an applicable margin of 200 or a base rate plus an applicable margin of 10 

 as of july 1 2016  we had 89 billion  of longterm variable rate debt outstanding and a one  percent increase in the variable rate of interest subject to each loan specific floor would have increased annual interest expense by 70 million  for additional information see part ii item 8 note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013  based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see report of independent registered public accounting firm herein 

our evaluation did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of sandisk corporation which was acquired on may 12 2016 total assets and total sales related to sandisk represented 17  and 6  respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended july 1 2016  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended july 1 2016  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

part iv 




 item 1  business 

general 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and provider of data storage solutions that enable consumers businesses governments and other organizations to create manage experience and preserve digital content our product portfolio includes hard disk drives “hdds” solidstate drives ssds direct attached storage solutions personal cloud network attached storage solutions and public and private cloud data center storage solutions hdds are our principal products and are today’s primary storage medium for the vast majority of digital content with the use of solidstate storage products growing rapidly our products are marketed under the hgst wd and gtechnology brand names 

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on important longterm growth trends in the rapidly changing storage industry  the ongoing expansion in digital content and the growth in the amount of that content being stored these trends are linked directly to consumers’ and commercial enterprises’ increasingly ubiquitous experience with data and the increasing value of that data the confluence of data growth and the ability to expand the extraction of value from data is driving the need for the longterm retention of as much data as possible for legal and regulatory purposes and for potential future refinements in a wide range of fields including advertising aerospace ecommerce energy medical mining and security surveillance we believe the ways in which people and organizations are creating and using data are changing and that the amount of data considered useful to store is expanding increasingly more and more digital content is being stored and managed on hard drives and solid state drives in the cloud environment and we believe we are strongly positioned to continue to play a role in this transition 

with a focus on innovation and value creation our goal is to grow through continued strong execution and with targeted investments in datacenter infrastructure mobility and the cloud 

due to regulatory requirements we have operated our global business since march 2012 through two independent subsidiaries  hgst and wd both longtime innovators in the storage industry in march 2014 we submitted an application to the ministry of commerce of the people’s republic of china “mofcom” to lift the condition it imposed on our company to operate these businesses separately at this time we are awaiting mofcom’s response to our application 

our headquarters are located in irvine california wdc was founded in 1970 as a specialized semiconductor manufacturer and since entering the hard drive industry in 1988 its wd subsidiary has been a technology standardsetter in the industry’s highest volume markets hgst a provider of highvalue storage in enterprise markets was acquired by wdc in march 2012 hgst was founded in 2003 through the combination of the hdd businesses of international business machines corporation the inventor of the hdd and hitachi ltd “hitachi” as of july 3 2015 wdc had approximately 9700 engineers and one of the industry’s largest patent portfolios with more than 7000 active patents worldwide 

we have relationships with the full range of customers currently addressing storage opportunities these include storage subsystem suppliers major server original equipment manufacturers “oems” internet and social media infrastructure players and personal computer “pc” and mac™ oems we sell our products to oems distributors resellers cloud infrastructure players and consumers we have a strong consumer brand heritage with our wd and gtechnology branded products businesses 

the storage market in which we operate is rapidly changing and evolving to address these dynamics we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve or in markets where we seek to broaden our participation and augment our resources and capabilities investments and acquisitions are a key part of our overall strategy to create longterm value within the storage ecosystem for example since the beginning of fiscal 2014  we have strengthened our enterprise ssd business with acquisitions of companies such as virident systems inc virident stec inc stec and velobit inc velobit in march 2015 we acquired amplidata nv amplidata a developer of object storage software for public and private cloud data centers a key building block in a new systems business we have entered called active archive storage that is addressing a new greenfield opportunity in the object storage space with this strategy we are assembling the technology building blocks to increase our overall market participation and be a fullline data storage solutions supplier balancing our core hard drive business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions 

industry 

the growth and changes in the global ecosystem for digital content storage solutions are being driven by several factors including 

 we are a market and customer driven company focused on growth innovation and value creation for our customers employees and shareholders we develop deep and collaborative relationships with customers aimed at making them more successful an approach that is being manifested in our role as a trusted advisor and market maker in our served markets we believe this approach is one of the key factors that will help us continue to achieve strong financial performance over the long term we believe our platform is broadbased and powerful with growth drivers and unique competitive advantages that will continue to provide us the opportunity to expand our valuecreation model within an evolving changing and growing storage ecosystem 

the ability to store large amounts of data is an ongoing enabler of the large amount of digital content being created and utilized we believe the growth in the number of computing users and connected mobile devices in the world continues unabated creating more usage and more digital content to be stored cloud computing applications are especially noteworthy given that they create multiple copies of photos videos and other content to ensure efficient distribution and security we believe that petabytes shipped in the hdd industry were up 14 in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 reflecting primarily the strength in demand for storage in enterprise cloud applications in addition we believe revenue in the ssd industry was up 24 in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 reflecting strength in ssd enterprise markets 

enterprise 

enterprise storage devices consist of performance and capacity hdds and ssds these devices are used in multiple types of enterprise datacenters that provide storage for a range of cloud and corporate applications within datacenters these drives are typically used in servers and storage systems there are also newer enterprise systems level products that address a category of data storage previously deemed inaccessible and too costly to access we recently began shipping a new category of enterprise storage product called active archive which is a fully enclosed rack system utilizing our helium hard drives and object storage software 

performance and capacity hdds and ssds are essential to the operations of an enterprise and require the greatest capabilities and reliability these drives are the most highly engineered product line in the storage industry the infrastructure to support cloud computing storage is driving the demand for multiplatter high capacity hdds as well as enterprise class ssds in tiered storage architectures cloud computing delivers shared resources software and information to users on demand on a multitude of devices such as client pcs tablets and smart phones most cloud computing models consist of services delivered through large datacenters with enterpriseclass servers also utilizing tiered architectures to address multiple levels of storage needs we believe we have established a leading position in supplying performance hdds multiplatter high capacity hdds and ssds to address these needs 

we believe petabyte shipments into the enterprise market of the storage industry were up 49 in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 future growth in the enterprise market is expected to occur based on public and private cloudrelated projects to address the continued growth in data being created and the demand to store much of that data 

client desktop and notebook pcs 

client storage devices consist of internal hdds and ssds for desktop and mobile pcs desktop pcs are intended for regular use at single locations in homes and businesses as well as in multiuser educational and government networks mobile pcs primarily notebook computers are used both in and away from homes and businesses the demand for hard drives in desktop and notebook pcs is in decline due to the slowdown in pc sales the increased use of ssds as replacements for hdds in notebook pcs and the growing shift of storage workloads to the cloud other hdd markets such as cloud traditional enterprise branded products gaming and other solutions have been expanding we believe the units shipped in client hard drives were down 12 in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 we believe that hdd unit shipments into client computer storage devices will be driven primarily by demand in emerging countries corporate and consumer refreshes and the enduring nature of pcs as the most fully functional computing device 

branded products 

external storage devices supplement the storage space on pc systems for home and small office networks and through wireless connections the fastest growing category in this market provide remote access to personal content these drives when directly attached to pcs are ideally suited to back up the data already stored on pc internal drives because of their portability and security features the growing availability of wireless connectivity is creating growth opportunities for external networked attached storage solutions such as our family of wd my cloud tm  products we believe hdd unit shipments into the external storage market decreased 6 in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 

consumer electronics 

hdds for ce products are primarily used in digital video recorders “dvrs” game consoles and security video recording systems we believe demand for greater storage capacity in these applications will continue to drive growth for higher capacity hdds 

dvrs offer greater consumer viewing flexibility and enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program game consoles enable users to save games movies music pictures and other user generated content security surveillance hard drives provide 247 reliability and peace of mind for the installation of home or small to medium sized business “smb” security systems we believe hdd unit shipments into the ce market increased 3 in fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014 

competition 

we compete with manufacturers of hdds for client compute client noncompute and enterprise applications and manufacturers of ssds the hdd market consists of five principal brands hgst samsung seagate toshiba and wd in solidstate products we compete with a wide range of manufacturers from small startup companies to multinational corporations including intel micron samsung sandisk seagate and toshiba 

  

the storage industry is increasingly utilizing tiered architectures with hdds and ssds to address an expanding set of uses and applications hdds are highly substitutable due to industry standards that mandate the technical form fit and function of hdds and we believe there are no substantial barriers for existing hdd competitors to offer competing products hdd attributes include product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer market and use and we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors semiconductor media or solidstate technology provides high performance attributes in some enterpriseclass applications and client notebook designs and attractive functionality in consumer handheld applications requiring smaller form factors lower power and less storage capacity such as smart phones and tablets with advances in our own solidstate enterprise business coupled with our actions to strengthen those resources through acquisitions and investments we believe we are positioned to compete successfully in the enterpriseclass solidstate space of this market advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could also result in competitive products for storing digital content with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis 

business strategy

technology 

hard disk drives 

hdds provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 9 

the storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density track density multiplied by bit density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area head and magnetic media technologies are two of the key technology components of hard drives affecting areal density we develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in our hard drive products as areal density increases achieving a given drive capacity potentially reduces product costs over time through reduced component requirements we also invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

industrystandard interfaces allow the drives to communicate with the host system the primary interface for pcs is sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are fibre channel sas sata and pcie 

solidstate drives 

ssds use semiconductor nonvolatile media rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads to store and allow fast access to data without any moving parts the cost per bit of solidstate drives is more expensive than hard drives but the higher inputoutput “io” performance makes ssds an attractive new tier of storage that fits between dram memory and hard drives ssds are finding growing usage in enterprise storage systems and servers in applications that demand the highest io performance 

the nonvolatile memory in use today for ssds is nand flash technology while singlelevel cell flash provides the highest endurance and performance the optimal balance of price and performance is usually achieved through the use of multilevel cell flash multiple nand flash die are used on a single printed circuit board assembly pcba and connected in parallel through a controller to the host bus various performance classes of ssds are created by varying the number of parallel nand channels and the speed of controller logic and firmware the controller contains hardware logic and firmware to buffer the data flow to and from the host to the nand flash and to manage the reliability and performance of the nand flash media 

the typical host interfaces for ssds include pcie sas and sata pcie products typically offer the highest performance and come on edge cards that plug into the pcie bus pcie defines the hardware and electrical interface but the software protocols are still proprietary today new standards such as nvme and scsi express are emerging to bring more standardized software protocols for communicating with pcie ssds sas and sata products utilize standardized interfaces similar to hard drives and come in 25inch form factors with differing package heights depending on the application and usage the typical power consumption for the sas and sata interfaces is similar to hard drives while the power consumption of pcie form factor devices is typically higher 

our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses totaled 16 billion  17 billion  and 16 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we have more than 7000 active patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our hdd production are high volume and utilization low cost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity 

hdd manufacturing is a complex process involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs for our nonhdd products we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

materials and supplies 

the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a pcba 

the hda includes heads magnetic media head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner and a pivotarm module on which the head gimbal assemblies hgas including suspension are mounted each disk surface has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk other key components of our hard drives are preamps and voice coil magnets 

the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a power device that controls the motor and hsa positioner and a systemonchip “soc” comprised of a drive interface controller and recording channel the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for our products consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers we depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our hdd product design and manufacturing 

the key components used in the manufacture of our ssds are the nand semiconductor media and soc which are acquired from third party suppliers the nand flash products used in our ssds are sourced from multiple tierone nand manufacturers we have established deep relationships with these vendors to assure continuous supply of nand as well as sufficient technical depth of technology access to enable continuous cost and technology leadership of our ssd product portfolio offering additionally we are exploring strategic options to further strengthen and deepen our collaboration with select nand partners to support the future growth of our ssd business additionally the key component in our media players the controller is acquired from third party suppliers 

we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select high quality low cost suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 79 80 and 78 of our net revenue for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion regarding associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and by providing information and support through our website in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale datacenter operators   purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations in addition we also sell directly to cloud infrastructure players which we classify as oems for purposes of channel information 

distributors  we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our websites 

for each of 2015 and 2014 sales to hewlett packard company accounted for 11 of our net revenue for 2013 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for a discussion of associated risks refer to part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customers see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for a further discussion of our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action

employees 

as of july 3 2015  we employed a total of 76449  employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs that we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement a majority of our employees in japan and china are subject to a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of associated risks see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors 

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties whether currently known or unknown any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or from anticipated future results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our common stock 

if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hgst our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of hgst we agreed to certain conditions required by mofcom including adopting measures to keep hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agrees otherwise with the minimum period being two years from the march 8 2012 closing date of the acquisition we worked closely with mofcom to finalize an operations plan that outlines in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement compliance with these measures has adversely affected and we believe will continue to adversely affect our business and financial conditions in the following ways   





  



  



in march 2014 we submitted an application to mofcom requesting that the regulatory restrictions be lifted in december 2014 we successfully resolved two noncompliance matters with mofcom relating to 1 the organization of a wdc department that included several former hgst employees and 2 the realignment of the ownership structure of an indirect subsidiary of wdc we cannot predict whether or when the regulatory restrictions will be wholly or partially lifted or whether we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of hgst even if the restrictions are wholly or partially lifted 

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole several factors contribute to these conditions and this uncertainty including but not limited to volatility in the financial and real estate markets cost increases and other macroeconomic factors some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these conditions include the following 

  



  



  



  



we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to declining average selling prices asps volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

demand for our devices software and solutions that we offer to our customers which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period as a result the storage market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition if more intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could adversely impact revenue and gross margins in addition we compete based on our ability to offer our customers competitive solutions that provide the most current and desired product and service features we expect that competition will continue to be intense and there is a risk that our competitors’ products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products further we face potential gross margin pressures resulting from our asps declining more rapidly than our cost of goods sold in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors along with others may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments further for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements which may prove to be inaccurate in addition because our products are designed to be largely 

interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

we experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems gaming consoles and ce tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

  

our sales to the ce cloud computing network attached storage nas surveillance and enterprise markets which have accounted for and may continue accounting for an increasing percentage of our overall revenue may grow at a slower rate than current estimates or not at all which could materially adversely impact our operating results 

the secular growth of digital data has resulted in a more diversified mix of revenue from the ce cloud computing nas surveillance and enterprise markets as sales into these markets have become a more significant portion of our revenue events or circumstances that adversely impact demand in these markets or our inability to address that demand successfully could materially adversely impact our operating results for example demand in or our sales to these markets may be adversely affected by the following 



  





  



in addition demand in these markets also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management and the emergence of new technologies such as data deduplication compression and storage virtualization if we are not able to respond appropriately these factors could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products thereby decreasing our revenue or 

putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand for storage our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results furthermore our ability to accurately read and respond to market trends such as trends relating to the internet or big data could harm our results 

deterioration in the client compute market the pc market has accelerated which could cause our operating results to suffer 

while sales to nonpc markets are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the pc market remain an important part of our business the pc market however has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the growth of tablet computers smart phones and similar devices that perform many of the same capabilities as pcs the lengthening of product life cycles and macroeconomic conditions we believe that the deterioration of the pc market has accelerated recently and that this accelerated deterioration may continue or further accelerate which could cause our operating results to suffer additionally if demand in the pc market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions demand for our products in the pc market may decrease at a faster rate and our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels we must successfully respond to the rapid change away from traditional advertising media marketing and sales methods to the use of internet media and advertising particularly social media and online sales or our brand and retail sales could be negatively affected adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd ®  hgst™ or gtechnology™ brand products our operating results may be adversely affected 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or if distribution markets for our products weaken our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the quarter ended july 3 2015  44  of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results could be harmed 

expansion into new markets may increase the complexity of our business cause us to increase our research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies or cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

to remain a significant supplier in the storage industry and to expand into new markets we will need to offer a broad range of storage products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch and 25inch hard drives solid state drives and systems and other products for the pc enterprise data center and other storage markets as we expand our product lines to sell into new markets such as our recent entry into active archive systems the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and we may become subject to different market dynamics these dynamics may include among other things different demand volume seasonality product requirements sales channels and warranty and return policies in addition expansion into other markets may result in increases in research and development expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability or technology enhancements if we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors or new entrants who offer these products 

our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality increasing capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks for our business 

we develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we produce consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media we may be unsuccessful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition as a result of our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves in addition as a result of adverse labor rates or availability we may be required to increase investments in automation which may cause our capital expenditures to increase if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

we make significant investments in research and development to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments or investments that are not cost effective could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a leading supplier of hard drives and a major supplier of enterprise ssds we make significant investments to maintain our existing products and to lead innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in research and development and in order to remain competitive we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model the current inherent physical limitations associated with storage technologies are resulting in more costly capital expenditures that reduce the cost benefits of technology transitions and could limit our ability to keep pace with reductions in asps these investments may not result in viable technologies or products and even if they do result in viable technologies or products they may not be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful or costineffective research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is also critical to the success of our business we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage 

  

consolidation within the data storage industry could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

the data storage industry as a whole has experienced consolidation over the past several years through acquisitions consolidations and decisions by industry players to exit the industry consolidation across the industry including by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside of storage products may over extended periods of time sell storage products at prices that we cannot profitably match 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside of storage products because they do not depend solely on sales of storage products to achieve profitability they may sell storage products at lower prices and operate their storage business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonstorage products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their storage products at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures 

we are subject to risks related to product defects or the unintended use of our products which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however our testing may fail to reveal defects in our products that may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not 

intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement as part of a product recall we may be required or choose to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition a product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or customer relationships and may cause us to lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provision do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

  

in addition thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate or use in our products may contain defects in design or manufacturing that could unexpectedly result in epidemic failures and subject us to liability 

  

because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for components subassemblies equipment consumables raw materials and logistics a supplier’s inability unwillingness or failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us can adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results 

we depend on an external supply base for technologies software including firmware components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our justintime hubs distribution centers and freight from suppliers to our factories and from our factories to our customers throughout the world many of these components and much of this equipment must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products technology and equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier the risk of supplier loss due to industry consolidation is enhanced 

many of the risks that affect us also affect our supply base including but not limited to having single site manufacturing locations based in high risk regions of the world macro and local economic conditions shortages of commodity materials proper management of technology transitions natural disasters geopolitical risks compliance with legal requirements financial instability and exposure to intellectual property and other litigation including an injunction or other action that could delay shipping if any of these risks were to affect our suppliers we could also be adversely affected especially in the case of products components or services that are singlesourced for example if suppliers are facing increased costs due to the above risks they may require us to enter into longterm volume agreements to shift the burden of fixed costs to us further we work closely with many of our suppliers to develop new technologies and as a result we may become subject to litigation from our suppliers or third parties 

without a capable and financially stable supply base that has established appropriate relationships within the supply chain and has implemented business processes strategies and risk management safeguards we would be unable to develop our products manufacture them in high volumes and distribute them to our customers to execute our business plans effectively as pc demand declines competition increases from nand and other consumer devices the total available market for hdds decreases and costs increase these suppliers may reevaluate their business models our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors consolidate or decide to exit the industry redirect their investments and increase costs to us each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition moving to new technologies may require us to align to and build a new supply base such as nand flash in the case of nand suppliers many of which are involved in developing storage products such as ssd that in some cases compete with our products our success in these new product areas may be dependent on our ability and their willingness to develop close relationships with preferential agreements where this cannot be done our business and operations may be adversely affected 

in addition to an external supply base we also rely on an internal supply chain of heads media and media substrate please see the risk factors entitled “ a fundamental change in storage technologies could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage” and “if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected” for a review of some of the risks related to our internal supply 

price volatility shortages of critical materials or components or use by other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry may negatively impact our operating results 

increases in the cost for certain critical materials and components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting our products and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers shortages of critical components such as dram and nand flash or materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of uncertain global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product longer product life cycles could also restrict our ability to transition customers to our newer products in a timely manner or at all negatively impacting our ability to recoup our significant research and development investments to improve our existing technology and develop new technologies if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

a fundamental change in storage technologies could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in storage technologies any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some revolutionary technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic recording heatassisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads magnetic media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however increasing areal density has become more difficult in the storage industry if we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to include more components in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new test equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gigabytes per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

  

if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions that we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

if we do not properly manage new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

as advances in computer hardware and software are made our customers have demanded a more diversified portfolio of products with new and additional features in some cases this demand results in investments in new products for a particular market that do not necessarily expand overall market opportunity which may negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

  



  



  



  



  





in particular as part of our growth strategy we have made significant investments in active archive systems which are designed to enable organizations to rapidly access massive longterm data stores for example our acquisition of amplidata was partially driven by our strategy to expand in this area we expect to continue to make significant investments in active archive systems our active archive systems may fail to gain market acceptance or the market for active archive systems may not grow as we anticipate 

we  have also seen and anticipate continuing to see an increase in customers requesting that we develop products including software associated with our products that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment adapting to this demand may cause product delays placing us at a competitive disadvantage open source products could also reduce our capability for product differentiation or innovation and our affected products could be diminished to commodity status which we expect would place increased downward pressure on our margins if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage issues associated with our product development generally our business may suffer 

if we fail to develop and introduce new products that are competitive against alternative storage technologies our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with technology advancements newer storage technologies have successfully served mobility markets for products that cannot be serviced using traditional storage technologies advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in other emerging technologies that can be competitive with traditional storage technologies for example ssds have significantly increased their penetration in notebook pcs in recent years we  believe that ssds will increasingly replace hdds in notebook and desktop pcs and we currently do not offer client ssd solutions we also expect that ssd penetration will increase in enterprise areas requiring  high performance needs in advanced digital computing we may be unsuccessful in anticipating and developing new and improved products for the client enterprise and other storage markets in response to competing technologies if our hard drive and solid state products fail to offer a superior value proposition to alternative storage products we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our business will suffer 

  

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and throughout asia the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations throughout asia and elsewhere a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’ other suppliers such as the spread of a pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of our products that we are able to manufacture or sell which would result in substantial harm to our operating results similarly a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other natural disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities including access to or from these facilities by employees or logistics operators would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results for example prior to the 2011 flooding in thailand all of wds internal slider capacity and 60 of wds hard drive manufacturing capacity was in thailand as a result of the flooding in thailand wds facilities were inundated and temporarily shut down during that period wds ability to manufacture hard drives was significantly constrained adversely affecting wds business financial condition and results of operations in addition the concentration of our manufacturing sites could exacerbate the negative impacts resulting from localized labor unrest or other employment issues a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

manufacturing marketing and selling our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing and sales efforts as well as risks associated with our utilization of and reliance on contract manufacturers including 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we our suppliers or our customers operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sudden disruptions to the availability of air transportation or ocean or land freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of air transportation cargo operations or ocean rail or truck freight lanes caused by among other things labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products 

if our technology infrastructure systems or products are compromised damaged or interrupted by cyber attacks data security breaches other security problems security vulnerabilities design defects or sustain system failures our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and as a result unauthorized parties have obtained in the past and may in the future obtain access to our computer systems and networks cyber attacks can include computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage we believe cyber attack attempts are increasing in number and that cyber attackers are developing increasingly sophisticated systems and means to not only attack systems but also to evade detection or to obscure their activities our products are also targets for cyber attacks while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers 

in addition our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures further our products contain sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that may contain security problems security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products 

if efforts to breach our infrastructure systems or products are successful or we are unable to protect against these risks we could suffer interruptions delays or cessation of operations of our systems and loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information intellectual property or sensitive or personal information breaches of our infrastructure systems or products could also cause our customers and other affected third parties to suffer loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information intellectual property or sensitive or personal information and could harm our relationships with customers and other third parties as a result we could experience additional costs indemnification claims litigation and damage to our brand and reputation all of these consequences could harm our reputation and our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use sharing and security of thirdparty data including personal data and our failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations could subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties significant legal liability or loss of customers loss of revenue and reputational harm  

we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of thirdparty data including data that relates to or identifies an individual person in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other 

parties with which we have commercial relations our possession and use of thirdparty data including personal data in conducting our business subjects us to legal and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify vendors customers or employees or other parties with which we have commercial relations of a data security breach and to respond to regulatory inquiries and to enforcement proceedings global privacy and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction compliance requirements and even our inadvertent failure to comply with applicable laws may cause us to incur substantial costs subject us to proceedings by governmental entities or others and cause us to incur penalties or other significant legal liability or lead us to change our business practices 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions which are a key part of our growth strategy it may adversely affect our future results 

we seek to be an industryleading developer manufacturer and provider of innovative storage solutions balancing our core hard drive business with growing investments in newer areas that we believe will provide us with higher growth opportunities acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business are a key part of our overall business strategy for example we completed the acquisitions of amplidata in march 2015 virident in october 2013 and stec in september 2013 in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition furthermore we may agree to provide continuing service obligations or enter into other agreements in order to obtain certain regulatory approvals of our corporate transactions and failure to satisfy these additional obligations could result in our failing to obtain regulatory approvals or the imposition of additional obligations on us any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

please also see the risk factor entitled “ if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hgst on a timely basis or at all our business and financial condition may be adversely affected”   

  

our strategic relationships subject us to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have entered into strategic relationships with various partners to reduce the risk associated with relying on external suppliers for technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing please see the risk factor entitled “ because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for components subassemblies equipment consumables raw materials and logistics a supplier’s inability unwillingness or failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us can adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results ” for a further description of the risks associated with our reliance on external suppliers these strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

  



  



  



  



  



  





  



  



  

if our strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

the loss of our key executive management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we lose our existing key management staff or skilled employees or are unable to hire and integrate new key management staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key management or staff our operating results would likely be harmed furthermore if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our intended realignment after we make decisions regarding our personnel and implement our realignment plans our operating results could be adversely affected 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers and customers to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation intellectual property risks increase when we enter into new markets where we have little or no intellectual property protection as a defense against litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 5 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k in relation to our litigation matter with seagate on october 8 2014 the minnesota supreme court affirmed the decision of the minnesota court of appeals and as a result on october 14 2014 we paid seagate 7734 million to satisfy the full amount of the final arbitration award plus interest accrued through october 13 2014 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers and customers are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier or customer could negatively impact our business 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual 

provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

  

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax regulations customers’ standards of corporate citizenship and industry and coalition standards such as those established by the electronics industry citizenship coalition could cause an increase in our operating costs 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health safety anticorruption and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our suppliers and partners timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our suppliers or partners fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties or legal liability and reputational damage which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry and coalition environmental initiatives such as those established by the electronics industry citizenship coalition the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain components and metals contained in our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use and source of gold tantalum tin and tungsten commonly referred to as 3tg or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies these rules require us to determine and report annually whether such 3tg originated from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain 3tg or 3tg generally at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of such components or 3tg since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” 3tg our customers including our oem customers may require that our products contain only conflict free 3tg and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement additionally we may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders if our products are not conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the 3tg contained in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we could incur significant costs to the extent that we are required to make changes to products processes or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures to the extent that proposed conflict minerals legislation is adopted by the european commission or canada these risks could increase 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers or customers could harm our business 

we expect our suppliers and customers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or customers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or customers or divergence of a supplier’s or customer’s business practices from those generally accepted as ethical could harm our business by   



  



  



  



  



  

any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

we may reduce or discontinue repurchases of our common stock as we deem appropriate and as market conditions allow we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of shares of our common stock are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin if this occurs it would have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the united states fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the united states 

we attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks our acquisition of hgst has also resulted in an increase to our customer credit risk given that we service many of the same customers any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including   



  

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

the resale of shares of common stock issued to hitachi ltd hitachi in connection with our acquisition of hgst could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

on march 8 2012 as partial consideration for our acquisition of hgst we issued 25 million shares of our common stock to hitachi on each of november 6 2013 and november 13 2014 hitachi completed a secondary offering of 125 million and 625 million respectively of these shares future sales of the remaining 625 million shares of our common stock held by hitachi could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our cash balances and investment portfolio are subject to various risks any of which could adversely impact our financial position 

given the international footprint of our business we have both domestic and international cash balances and investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings security types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market political sovereign and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a material part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities and bank deposits if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that our investments may experience an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could also have an adverse impact on our financial position 

in addition i f we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock we may choose or be required to increase our borrowings if available or to repatriate funds to the united states at a substantial tax cost 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our stock price may be adversely affected 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 3 2015 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting in future periods investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our stock price 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could restrict current and future operations or limit our flexibility to take certain actions 

our credit agreement includes covenants relating to our financial performance and financial position in addition our credit agreement restricts our ability to take other actions with respect to our current and future operations including our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or consolidate merge or sell assets our ability to meet these restrictive covenants may be affected by events that could be beyond our control and a breach of these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement which if not cured or waived could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could result in material adverse consequences that negatively impact our business 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax examinations or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received notice of proposed adjustments seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with loss or nonrenewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future in addition any actions by us to repatriate nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes may impact our effective tax rate

 39 

summary comparison of 2015  2014  and 2013   

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue in millions except percentages 

  



the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding unit shipments asps and net revenues by geography and channel in millions except percentages and asps 

  



 

 fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014   

net revenue net revenue was 146 billion  for 2015  a decrease  of 4  from 2014  the decrease was primarily due to a 8 decline in total hdd shipments partially offset by an increase in asps total hdd shipments in 2015   decreased  to 229 million  units as compared to 249 million  units for the prior year primarily due to a decrease in client pc demand asps were 60  for 2015  an increase of 2  from 2014  primarily due to a change in product mix 

changes in net revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2015  and 2014  these programs represented 10  and 8  of gross revenues respectively these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of products 

gross profit gross profit for 2015  was 42 billion  a decrease  of 139 million  from the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower volume gross profit as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat at 290  in 2015  as compared to 288  in 2014  

operating expenses   

research and development rd expense was 16 billion  in 2015  a decrease  of 15 million  or 1  over the prior year this slight decrease  was primarily due to lower incentive compensation partially offset by an additional week in fiscal 2015 and additional expenses related to our acquisitions 

selling general and administrative sga expense was 773 million  in 2015  an increase  of 12 million  or 2  as compared to 2014  adjusting for a 37 million  floodrelated insurance recovery in 2015  compared to a 65 million  floodrelated insurance recovery in 2014  sga expense decreased 16 million or 2 compared to 2014 this slight decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation partially offset by an additional week in fiscal 2015 and additional expenses related to our acquisitions 

during 2015  and 2014  we recorded 15 million  and 52 million  respectively for charges related to the seagate matter for further details see part ii item 8 note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2015  we recorded 176 million  of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 82 million  of employee termination costs 82 million  of asset impairment charges and 12 million  of contract termination and other charges during 2014  we recorded 95 million  of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 27 million  of employee termination costs 62 million  of asset impairment charges and 6 million  of contract termination and other charges 

other expense net other expense net was 34 million  in 2015  compared to 39 million  in 2014  interest and other income decreased  to 15 million  in 2015  from 17 million  in 2014  primarily due a 3 million  gain on the sale of our auctionrate securities in 2014  interest and other expense decreased  to 49 million  in 2015  from 56 million  in 2014  primarily due to a 4 million  writeoff of debt issuance costs in 2014  

income tax provision income tax expense was 112 million  in 2015  as compared to 135 million  in 2014  tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 71  in 2015  compared to 77  in 2014  our income tax provision for 2015  reflects a tax benefit of 27 million  as a result of the retroactive extension of the us federal research and development tax credit the rd credit that was signed into law on december 19 2014 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2016 through 2025 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

as of july 3 2015  we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 350 million  we recognized a net increase of 50 million  in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2015  interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

the internal revenue service “irs” previously completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and we and the irs reached agreement with respect to all matters except on the proposed adjustments to income before income taxes relating to intercompany payable balances the proposed adjustments relating to intercompany payable balances for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 are addressed in conjunction with the irs’s examination of our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 which commenced in january 2012 we received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa from the irs for fiscal year 2009 relating to intercompany payable balances and two nopas from the irs for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the nopas relating to intercompany payable balances and transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries propose to increase our us taxable income which would result in additional federal tax expense of approximately 72 million  and 723 million  respectively subject to interest we disagree with the proposed adjustments believe that the tax positions are properly supported and will vigorously contest the position taken by the irs in january 2012 the irs commenced an examination of the 2007 fiscal period ended september 5 2007 of komag incorporated which we acquired on september 5 2007 the irs examined calendar years 2010 and 2011 of hgst which was acquired by us on march 8 2012 and completed the examination with no material adjustments 

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax examinations are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of july 3 2015  it is not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months any significant change in the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns 

fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 

net revenue net revenue was 151 billion for 2014 a decrease of 1 from 2013 asps were 58 for 2014 a decrease of 3 from 2013 these decreases were primarily due to modest price declines and a change in product mix partially offset by an increase in unit shipments total hard drive shipments in 2014 increased to 249 million units as compared to 242 million units for the prior year primarily due to strength in our ce solutions including gaming consoles 

changes in net revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for each of 2014 and 2013 these programs represented 8 of gross revenues these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

gross profit gross profit for 2014 was 44 billion a decrease of 3 million from the prior year gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to 288 in 2014 as compared to 284 in 2013 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by higher volumes in 2014 as compared to 2013 as well as a continued focus on operational excellence 

operating expenses   

rd expense was 17 billion in 2014 an increase of 89 million or 6 over the prior year this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of virident and stecs rd expenses from the dates of acquisition and the continued investment in product development as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 110 in 2014 compared to 102 in 2013 

sga expense was 761 million in 2014 an increase of 55 million or 8 as compared to 2013 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to the inclusion of virident and stecs sga expenses from the dates of acquisition and the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and growing markets partially offset by a 65 million gain on floodrelated insurance recovery sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 50 in 2014 compared to 46 in 2013 

during 2014 and 2013 we recorded 52 million and 681 million respectively for charges related to the seagate matter for further detail see part ii item 8 note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2014 we recorded 95 million of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 27 million of employee termination costs 62 million of asset impairment charges and 6 million of other charges during 2013 we recorded 138 million of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 109 million of employee termination costs 14 million of asset impairment charges and 15 million of other charges 

other expense net other expense net was 39 million in 2014 compared to 44 million in 2013 interest and other income increased from 11 million in 2013 to 17 million in 2014 primarily due to a 3 million gain on the sale of our auctionrate securities in 2014 and a higher average daily invested cash balance for the period interest and other expense increased from 55 million in 2013 to 56 million in 2014 primarily due to a 4 million writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with lenders that extinguished or reduced their participation in our new credit agreement offset by lower variable interest rates on our average debt balance in 2014 

income tax provision income tax expense was 135 million in 2014 as compared to 242 million in 2013 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 77 in 2014 compared to 198 in 2013 we recorded an 88 million charge to reduce our previously recognized california deferred tax assets in fiscal 2013 as a result of the enactment of california proposition 39 california proposition 39 which was approved by california voters on november 6 2012 affects california state income tax apportionment for most multistate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2013 

this proposition reduces our future income apportioned to california making it less likely for us to realize certain california deferred tax assets in addition our income tax provision for 2013 also reflects a tax benefit of 37 million as a result of the retroactive extension of the rd credit the rd credit which had previously expired on december 31 2011 was extended through december 31 2013 as part of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2016 through 2025 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

as of june 27 2014 we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 300 million we recognized a net increase of 60 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2014 interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

liquidity and capital resources 

we ended 2015  with total cash and cash equivalents of 50 billion  an increase  of 220 million  from june 27 2014  the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended july 3 2015  in millions 

  



our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt dividend stock repurchase and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in part i item 1a in this annual report on form 10k 

a total of 43 billion  and 35 billion  of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the united states at july 3 2015  and june 27 2014  respectively substantially all of the amounts held outside of the united states are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations as described in part ii item 8 note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we paid 773 million  to seagate in 2015 from one of our foreign subsidiaries using cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states our board of directors previously approved a capital allocation plan that includes repurchases of our common stock and the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations or capital allocation plan in the event funds from foreign operations are needed in the united states any repatriation could result in the accrual and payment of additional us income tax 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 22 billion  in 2015  as compared to 28 billion  and 31 billion  in 2014  and 2013  respectively cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash used in working capital changes was 593 million  for 2015  as compared to net cash used in working capital changes of 234 million  in 2014  and net cash provided by working capital changes of 715 million  for 2013  

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2015  were as follows 

  



in 2015  our days sales outstanding “dsos” decreased  by 9  days days in inventory “dios” increased  by 8  days and days payables outstanding “dpos” remained flat  compared to 2014 changes in dsos are generally related to the linearity of shipments for 2015 the decrease in dsos was due to both the linearity of shipments and the sale of trade receivables in connection with our factoring agreement changes in dios are generally related to the timing of inventory builds changes in dpos are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment term modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2015  was 10 billion  as compared to 19 billion  for 2014  and 10 billion  for 2013  during 2015  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 257 million  related to acquisitions net of cash acquired 612 million  of capital expenditures 857 million  related to the purchase of investments offset by 5 million  of other investing activities net and 768 million  of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments in 2014 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 823 million related to acquisitions net of cash acquired 628 million of capital expenditures 561 million related to the purchase of investments offset by 4 million of other investing activities net and 72 million of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments

other than facility lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions see “contractual obligations and commitments” below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have an interest in or relationships with any specialpurpose entities 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following is a summary of our known contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of july 3 2015  in millions 

  

 

 debt 

as of july 3 2015  we had 255 million  outstanding on our revolving credit facility and 23 billion  outstanding on our term loan facility the revolving credit facility is classified within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of july 3 2015  due to our intent to repay the borrowings in 2016 we are required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loan facility totaling 156 million in fiscal 2016  219 million in fiscal 2017  250 million in fiscal 2018  and the remaining balance of 17 billion  in fiscal 2019  as of july 3 2015  we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreement for additional information see part ii item 8 note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

purchase orders 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers containing minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to commitments 

foreign exchange contracts 

we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and part ii item 8 notes 1 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements   

unrecognized tax benefits 

as of july 3 2015  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits including related accrued interest and penalties was 350 million  of which 291 million  could result in potential cash payments we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax payments related to these obligations 

see part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our total tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors previously authorized 30 billion for the repurchase of our common stock on february 3 2015 our board of directors authorized an additional 20 billion for the repurchase of our common stock and approved the extension of our stock repurchase program to february 3 2020 we repurchased 96 million  shares of our common stock for a total cost of 970 million  in 2015  the remaining amount available to be purchased under our stock repurchase program as of july 3 2015  was 22 billion  subsequent to july 3 2015  and through august 13 2015  we repurchased an additional 07 million  shares of our common stock for a total cost of 60 million  we may continue to repurchase our common stock as we deem appropriate repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a rule 10b51 plan we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows and borrowings under our credit agreement 

cash dividend policy 

on september 13 2012 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy under the cash dividend policy holders of our common stock receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors in 2015  we declared aggregate cash dividends of 180  per share of our common stock totaling 418 million  of which 302 million  was paid during 2015  we also paid 94 million  of dividends in 2015  related to dividends accrued in 2014  on august 4 2015  we declared a cash dividend of 050  per share of our common stock to shareholders of record as of october 2 2015  which will be paid on october 15 2015  we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time see part ii item 5 included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue and accounts receivable 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information and customer claim processing if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differs from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product generally total sales incentive and marketing programs range from 7  to 11  of gross revenues per quarter for 2015  sales incentive and marketing programs were 10  of gross revenues changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 07  of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2013 customer sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could materially affect operating results 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

warranty 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated replacement costs estimated repair costs which include scrap costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross profit and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value we use the firstin firstout “fifo” method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories while we use the weightedaverage method to value precious metal inventories weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production the weightedaverage method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a fifo method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

stockbased compensation 

we account for all stockbased compensation at fair value stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan purchase rights are estimated using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model we account for stock appreciation rights “sars” as liability awards based upon our intention to settle such awards in cash the sars liability is recognized for that portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date the sharebased liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date with amounts exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we either use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired or we perform a twostep approach to quantify impairment if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to follow a twostep approach to quantify the impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired in business combinations and inprocess research and development inprocess research and development is not amortized until the point at which it reaches technological feasibility instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired acquired intangibles are amortized on a straightline basis over their respective estimated useful lives longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition refer to part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated by reference in response to this item 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

as of july 3 2015  we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

  



 

 in 2015  2014  and 2013  total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

disclosure about other market risks 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of the applicable borrower either a a customary london interbank offered rate a “eurodollar rate” or b a customary base rate a “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margins range from 125 to 200 with respect to eurodollar rate borrowings and 025 to 100 with respect to base rate borrowings wdt wdi and wd international are also required to pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility which ranges from 0175 to 0300 per annum the applicable margins for borrowings and the commitment fee ranges are determined based upon a leverage ratio of us and our subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan and revolving credit facility would increase interest expense by approximately 26 million annually for additional information see part ii item 8 note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 1992  based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see report of independent registered public accounting firm herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended july 3 2015  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

part iv 




 item 1  business 

general 

we are a leading developer manufacturer and provider of data storage solutions that enable consumers businesses governments and other organizations to create manage experience and preserve digital content our product portfolio includes hard disk drives “hdds” and solidstate drives ssds hdds are our principal products and are today’s primary storage medium for digital content with the use of solidstate storage products growing rapidly our products are marketed under the hgst wd and gtechnology brand names over the last 10 years we have achieved strong financial results including consistently strong cash flow generation 

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on important longterm growth trends in the rapidly changing storage industry  the ongoing expansion in digital content and the growth in the amount of that content being stored these trends are linked directly to consumers’ and commercial enterprises’ increasingly ubiquitous experience with data and the increasing value of that data the confluence of data growth and the ability to expand the extraction of value from data is driving the need for the longterm retention of as much data as possible for legal and regulatory purposes and for potential future refinements in a wide range of fields we believe the ways in which people and organizations are creating and using data are changing and that the amount of data considered useful to store is expanding we also believe we are strongly positioned to play a role in the continuation of these trends as an enabler of the creation and storage of additional data with a focus on innovation and value creation our goal is to grow through continued strong execution and with targeted investments in datacenter infrastructure mobility and the cloud 

due to regulatory requirements we operate our global business through two independent subsidiaries  hgst and wd both longtime innovators in the storage industry in march 2014 we submitted an application to the ministry of commerce of the people’s republic of china “mofcom” to lift the condition it imposed on our company to operate these businesses separately at this time we are awaiting mofcom’s response to our application 

our headquarters are located in irvine california wdc was founded in 1970 as a specialized semiconductor manufacturer and since entering the hard drive industry in 1988 its wd subsidiary has been a technology standardsetter in the industry’s highest volume markets hgst a provider of highvalue storage in enterprise markets was acquired by wdc in march 2012 hgst was founded in 2003 through the combination of the hdd businesses of international business machines corporation the inventor of the hdd and hitachi ltd “hitachi” as of june 27 2014 wdc had approximately 9400 engineers and one of the industry’s largest patent portfolios with more than 7000 active patents worldwide 

  

hgst and wd have relationships with the full range of customers currently addressing storage opportunities these include storage subsystem suppliers major server original equipment manufacturers “oems” internet and social media infrastructure players and personal computer “pc” and mac™ oems through hgst and wd we sell our products to oems distributors resellers cloud infrastructure players and consumers we have a strong consumer brand heritage with our wd and gtechnology branded products businesses 

the storage market in which we operate is rapidly changing and evolving to address these dynamics we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve or in markets where we seek to broaden our participation and augment our resources and capabilities we have taken actions to strengthen our enterprise ssd business with the acquisitions of stec inc “stec” velobit inc velobit and virident systems inc virident and our strategic investments in skyera inc a provider of enterprise solidstate storage systems tegile systems inc a provider of hybrid storage arrays and avere systems a supplier of enterprise storage for the hybrid cloud in making these investments we seek to develop strategic relationships with technology innovators in the broader storage market to enable our customers to develop highly optimized storage solutions that meet their changing data management needs we believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market participation and be a fullline data storage solutions supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions 

industry 

the growth and changes in the global market for digital content storage solutions are being driven by several factors including 

 we are a market and customer driven company focused on growth innovation and value creation for our customers employees and shareholders we develop deep and collaborative relationships with customers aimed at making them more successful an approach that is being manifested in our role as a trusted advisor and market maker in our served markets we believe this approach is one of the key factors that will help us continue to achieve strong financial performance we believe our platform is broadbased and powerful with growth drivers and unique competitive advantages that will continue to provide us the opportunity to expand our valuecreation model within an evolving changing and growing storage market 

the ability to store large amounts of data is an ongoing enabler of the large amount of digital content being created and utilized we believe the growth in the number of computing users and connected mobile devices in the world continues unabated creating more usage and more digital content to be stored cloud computing applications are especially noteworthy given that they create multiple copies of photos videos and other content to ensure efficient distribution and security we believe unit volumes in the hdd industry were up 3 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 reflecting strength in gaming and the hdd enterprise markets in addition we believe unit volumes in the ssd industry were up 24 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 reflecting strength in ssd enterprise markets 

enterprise 

enterprise storage devices consist of performance and capacity hdds and ssds all of these devices are used in multiple types of enterprise datacenters that provide storage for a range of cloud and corporate applications within datacenters these drives are typically used in servers and storage systems 

performance applications are essential to the operations of an enterprise and require the greatest capabilities and reliability in hdds and ssds these drives are the most highly engineered product line in the storage industry the infrastructure to support cloud computing storage is driving the demand for multiplatter high capacity hdds and enterprise class ssds in tiered architectures cloud computing delivers shared resources software and information to users on demand on a multitude of devices such as client pcs tablets and smart phones most cloud computing models consist of services delivered through large datacenters with enterpriseclass servers utilizing tiered architectures to address multiple levels of storage needs we believe we have established a leading position in supplying advanced multiplatter high capacity hdds and ssds to address these needs 

we believe shipments into the enterprise market of the storage industry were up 12 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 we believe that high capacity hdds performance hdds and ssds represented 46 45 and 9 of the industry unit shipments into enterprise systems in fiscal 2014 respectively future growth in the enterprise segment is expected to occur based on public and private cloudrelated projects to address the continued growth in data being created and the demand to store much of that data 

  client desktop and notebook pcs 

client storage devices consist of internal hdds and ssds for desktop and mobile pcs desktop pcs are intended for regular use at single locations in homes and businesses as well as in multiuser educational and government networks mobile pcs primarily notebook computers are used both in and away from homes and businesses we believe that the demand for client computer hdds and ssds will continue primarily due to demand in emerging countries corporate and consumer refreshes the proliferation of digital content and changing requirements for increasing performance and thinner and lighter devices with lower power consumption 

  

mobile hdds for notebook pcs have traditionally been in a 25inch form factor with a 95 mm height we believe we have led a trend toward thinner lighter devices with extended battery life and low power consumption with our family of 7 mm height drives and more recently with our 5 mm height drives mobile hybrid drives have not yet attracted widespread adoption due to the challenges of managing the overall cost of pc systems including new features such as touch screens and sleek designs 

we believe the pc market which includes notebook and desktop pcs and comprises the client market was down 5 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 due to the diversification of the digital content storage market while the pc market remains the storage industry’s largest unit volume market it has been declining in recent years while other markets such as cloud traditional enterprise branded products gaming and other solutions have been expanding although still in decline we saw a reduction in the rate of decline in pcs over the last several quarters of fiscal 2014 and we believe the rate of decline in the pc market has moderated 

we believe industry unit shipments of mobile hdds into the client space decreased 7 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 while unit shipments of desktop hdds increased 2 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 we believe industry unit shipments of ssds into client compute systems increased 20 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 while unit shipments of ssds in pcs increased 40 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 

branded products 

external storage devices supplement the storage space on pc systems for home and small office networks and through wireless connections the fastest growing category in this market provide remote access to personal content these drives when directly attached to pcs are ideally suited to back up the data already stored on pc internal drives because of their portability and security features the growing availability of wireless connectivity is spurring growth of external networked attached storage solutions such as our family of wd my cloud tm  products we believe hdd shipments into the external storage market increased 2 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 branded products also include media players that connect to a user’s television or home theater system and play digital movies music and photos from an integrated hdd universal serial bus “usb” mass storage device or content services accessed over the internet 

consumer electronics 

hdds for consumer electronics ce products are primarily used in digital video recorders “dvrs” game consoles and security video recording systems we believe demand for greater storage capacity in these applications will continue to drive growth for higher capacity hdds 

dvrs offer greater consumer viewing flexibility and enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program game consoles enable users to save games movies music pictures and other user generated content security surveillance hard drives provide 247 reliability and peace of mind for the installation of home or small to medium sized business “smb” security systems we believe hdd unit shipments into the ce market increased 35 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 this increase was due in part to a refresh cycle by the world’s two largest game console makers who introduced new models in fiscal 2014 both of which feature hdds as standard equipment 

competition 

we compete with manufacturers of hdds for client compute client noncompute and enterprise applications and manufacturers of ssds the hdd market consists of five principal brands hgst samsung seagate toshiba and wd in solidstate products we compete with a wide range of manufacturers from small startup companies to multinational corporations including intel corporation micron technology inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation seagate technology llc and toshiba corporation 

  

the storage industry is increasingly utilizing tiered architectures with hdds and ssds to address an expanding set of uses and applications hdds are highly substitutable due to industry standards that mandate the technical form fit and function of hdds and we believe there are no substantial barriers for existing hdd competitors to offer competing products hdd attributes include product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer market and use and we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors semiconductor media or solidstate technology provides high performance attributes in some enterpriseclass applications and client notebook designs and attractive functionality in consumer handheld applications requiring smaller form factors lower power and less storage capacity such as smart phones and tablets with advances in our own solidstate enterprise business coupled with our actions to strengthen those resources through acquisitions and investments we believe we are positioned to compete successfully in the enterpriseclass solidstate segment of this market advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could also result in competitive products for storing digital content with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis

technology 

hard disk drives 

hdds provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 9 

 the storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density track density multiplied by bit density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area head and magnetic media technologies are two of the key technology components of hard drives affecting areal density we develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in our hard drive products as areal density increases achieving a given drive capacity potentially reduces product costs over time through reduced component requirements we also invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

industrystandard interfaces allow the drives to communicate with the host system the primary interface for pcs is sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are fibre channel sas sata and pcie 

solidstate drives 

ssds use semiconductor nonvolatile media rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads to store and allow fast access to data without any moving parts the cost per bit of solidstate drives is more expensive than hard drives but the higher inputoutput “io” performance makes solidstate drives an attractive new tier of storage that fits between dram memory and hard drives solidstate drives are finding growing usage in enterprise storage systems and servers in applications that demand the highest io performance 

the nonvolatile memory in use today for solidstate drives is nand flash technology while single level cell flash provides the highest endurance and performance the optimal balance of price and performance is usually achieved through the use of multilevel cell flash multiple nand flash die are used on a single pcba and connected in parallel through a controller to the host bus various performance classes of solidstate drives are created by varying the number of parallel nand channels and the speed of controller logic and firmware the controller contains hardware logic and firmware to buffer the data flow to and from the host to the nand flash and to manage the reliability and performance of the nand flash media 

the typical host interfaces for ssds include pcie sas and sata pcie products typically offer the highest performance and come on edge cards that plug into the pcie bus pcie defines the hardware and electrical interface but the software protocols are still proprietary today new standards such as nvme and scsi express are emerging to bring more standardized software protocols for communicating with pcie solidstate drives sas and sata products utilize standardized interfaces similar to hard drives and come in 25inch form factors with differing package heights depending on the application and usage the typical power consumption for the sas and sata interfaces is similar to hard drives while the power consumption of pcie form factor devices is typically higher 

our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses totaled 17 billion  16 billion  and 11 billion  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively for a discussion of associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we have more than 7000 active patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our active patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for a discussion of associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our hdd production are high volume and utilization low cost assembly and testing strict adherence to quality metrics and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity 

hdd manufacturing is a complex process involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs for our non hdd products we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

materials and supplies 

the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” 

the hda includes heads magnetic media head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner and a pivotarm module on which the head gimbal assemblies hgas including suspension are mounted each disk surface has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk other key components of our hard drives are preamps and voice coil magnets 

the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a power device that controls the motor and hsa positioner and a systemonchip “soc” comprised of a drive interface controller and recording channel the drive interface 

receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for our products consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers we depend on an external supply base for all remaining components and materials for use in our hdd product design and manufacturing 

the key components used in the manufacture of our ssds are the nand semiconductor media and soc which are acquired from third party suppliers the nand flash products used in our ssds are sourced from multiple tierone nand manufacturers we have established deep relationships with these vendors to assure continuous supply of nand as well as sufficient technical depth of technology access to enable continuous cost and technology leadership of our ssd product portfolio offering additionally we are exploring strategic options to further strengthen and deepen our collaboration with select nand partners to support the future growth of our ssd business additionally the key component in our media players the controller is acquired from third party suppliers 

we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of united states “us” companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 80 78 and 81 of our net revenue for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion regarding associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and providing information and support through our web site in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale datacenter operators   purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations in addition we also sell directly to cloud infrastructure players which we classify as oems for purposes of channel information 

distributors  we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our web sites 

for each of 2014 and 2012 sales to hewlett packard company accounted for 11 of our net revenue for 2013 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for a discussion of associated risks refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major 

customers see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for a further discussion of our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action

employees 

as of june 27 2014  we employed a total of 84072  employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement a majority of our employees in japan and employees of two of our manufacturing subsidiaries in china are subject to a collective bargaining agreement while our third manufacturing subsidiary in china has its own labor union of which many of its direct employees are members it has yet to begin collective bargaining negotiations we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of associated risks see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company’s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or from anticipated future results of operations and financial condition any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations or the market price of its common stock 

if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hgst on a timely basis or at all our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of hgst we agreed to certain conditions required by the ministry of commerce of the people’s republic of china “mofcom” including adopting measures to keep hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agrees otherwise with the minimum period being two years from the march 8 2012 closing date of the acquisition we worked closely with mofcom to finalize an operations plan that outlines in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement compliance with these measures has affected and may continue to affect our business and financial conditions in the following ways   





  



  



in march 2014 we submitted an application to mofcom requesting that the regulatory restrictions be lifted however we cannot predict whether or when these restrictions will be wholly or partially lifted or whether we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of hgst even if the restrictions are wholly or partially lifted 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our acquisition of hgst we divested certain assets to toshiba and agreed to provide certain support services for those assets for a period of time and our business will be adversely affected in the event we fail to successfully meet our obligations to toshiba under the divestiture transaction 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our acquisition of hgst we agreed subject to review by regulatory agencies in certain jurisdictions to divest certain assets to toshiba that would expand toshiba’s capacity to manufacture 35inch hard drives for the desktop consumer electronics and nearline business critical applications while this divestiture transaction closed in may 2012 we agreed to provide certain support service for those assets for a period of time if we are not able to meet our continuing service obligations under our agreement with toshiba the jurisdictions that conditioned their approval of the hgst acquisition on the divestiture could impose additional obligations on us which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole several factors contribute to these conditions and this uncertainty including but not limited to volatility in the financial and real estate markets cost increases and other macroeconomic factors some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these conditions include the following 

  



  



  



  



we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to the risk of declining average selling prices asps volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

demand for our devices software and solutions that we offer to our customers which we refer to in this item 1a as our “products” depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for our products in any given period as a result the storage market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition if more intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could adversely impact revenue and gross margins in addition we compete based on our ability to offer our customers competitive solutions that provide the most current and desired product and service features we expect that competition will continue to be intense and there is a risk that our competitors’ products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors along with others may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments in addition because our products are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

we experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and ce tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for our products however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

  

our sales to the ce cloud computing and enterprise markets representing an increasing percentage of our overall revenue may grow at a slower rate than current estimates which could materially adversely impact our operating results 

the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of revenue from the ce cloud computing and enterprise markets as sales into these markets become a more significant portion of our revenue events or circumstances that adversely impact demand in these markets or our inability to address that demand successfully could materially adversely impact our operating results for example demand in or our sales to these markets may be adversely affected by the following 

  

  



  





  



in addition demand in these other markets also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management and the emergence of new technologies such as data deduplication compression and storage virtualization if we are not able to respond appropriately these factors could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand for storage our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results furthermore our ability to accurately read and respond to market trends such as trends relating to the internet or big data could harm our results 

if we fail to respond to changes in the client compute market the “pc market” our operating results could suffer 

while sales to the other markets are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the pc market remain an important part of our business the pc market however has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the growth of tablet computers smart phones and similar devices that perform many of the same capabilities as pcs the lengthening of product life cycles and macroeconomic conditions if we fail to respond to changes in the pc market our operating results could suffer additionally if demand in the pc market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions demand for our products in the pc market may decrease at a faster rate and our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels including traditional retail ecommerce and online channels adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd ®  hgst™ or gtechnology™ brand products our operating results may be adversely affected 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or if distribution markets for our products weaken our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the quarter ended june 27 2014  45 of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers and during the fiscal year ended june 27 2014 44 of our revenue came from sales to such customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

also the storage ecosystem is constantly evolving and our traditional customer base is changing fewer companies now hold greater market share for certain applications and services such as social media shopping and streaming media as a result the competitive landscape is changing giving these companies increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition the changes in our evolving customer base create new selling and distribution patterns to which we must adapt to remain competitive we must respond to these changes by ensuring we have proper scale in this evolving market as well as offer products that meet the technological requirements of this customer base at competitive pricing points to the extent we are not successful in adequately responding to these changes our operating results could be harmed 

expansion into new markets may increase the complexity of our business cause us to increase our research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies or cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

to remain a significant supplier in the storage industry and to expand into new markets we will need to offer a broad range of storage products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch and 25inch hard drives solid state drives and other products for the pc and other storage markets as we expand our product line to sell into new markets the overall complexity of our business increases at an accelerated rate and we become subject to different market dynamics these dynamics may include among other things different demand volume seasonality product requirements sales channels and warranty and return policies in addition expansion into other markets may result in increases in research and development expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability or technology enhancements if we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors or new entrants who offer these products 

our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality increasing capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks for our business 

we develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we produce consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition as a result of our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional 

risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves in addition as a result of adverse labor rates or availability we may be required to increase investments in automation which may cause our capital expenditures to increase if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

we make significant investments in research and development to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a leading supplier of hard drives and a major supplier of enterprise solid state drives we make significant investments to maintain our existing products and to lead innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in research and development and in order to remain competitive we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model there can be no assurance that these investments will result in viable technologies or products or if these investments do result in viable technologies or products that they will be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is also critical to the success of our business we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage 

  

consolidation within the data storage industry could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

the data storage industry as a whole has experienced consolidation over the past several years through acquisitions consolidations and decisions by industry players to exit the industry consolidation across the industry including by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside of storage products may over extended periods of time sell storage products at prices that we cannot profitably match 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside of storage products because they do not depend solely on sales of storage products to achieve profitability they may sell storage products at lower prices and operate their storage business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonstorage products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their storage products at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume original equipment manufacturers oems which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures 

we are subject to risks related to product defects or the unintended use of our products which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market in addition our products may be used in a manner that is not intended or anticipated by us resulting in potential liability accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition a product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or customer relationships and may cause us to lose market share with our customers including our oem and original design manufacturers odm customers 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional expenses if our warranty provision do not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

  

in addition thirdparty components or applications that we incorporate or use in our products may contain defects in design or manufacturing that could unexpectedly result in epidemic failures and subject us to liability 

  

because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for components subassemblies equipment consumables raw materials and logistics a supplier’s inability unwillingness or failure to support us in a timely manner with goods or services at a quality level and cost acceptable to us can adversely affect our margins revenues and operating results 

we depend on an external supply base for technologies components equipment and materials for use in our product design and manufacturing we also depend on service suppliers for providing technical support for our products in addition we use logistics partners to manage our jit justintime hubs distribution centers and freight from suppliers to our factories and from our factories to our customers throughout the world many of these components and much of this equipment must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products technology and equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently however many of the risks that affect us also affect our supply base including but not limited to having single site manufacturing locations based in high risk regions of the world macro and local economic conditions shortages of commodity materials proper management of technology transitions natural disasters geopolitical risks compliance with legal requirements financial instability and exposure to intellectual property and other litigation including an injunction or other action that could delay shipping if any of these risks were to affect our suppliers we could also be adversely affected especially in the case of products components or services that are singlesourced for example if suppliers are facing increased costs due to the above risks they may require us to enter into longterm volume agreements to shift the burden of fixed costs to us further we work closely with many of our suppliers to develop new technologies and as a result we may become subject to litigation from our suppliers or third parties 

without a capable and financially stable supply base that has established appropriate relationships within the supply chain and has implemented business processes strategies and risk management safeguards we would be unable to develop our products manufacture them in high volumes and distribute them to our customers to execute our business plans effectively as pc demand slows competition increases from nand and other consumer devices the total available market for hard disk drives decreases and costs increase these suppliers may reevaluate their business models our suppliers may be acquired by our competitors consolidate or decide to exit the industry redirect their investments and increase costs to us each of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition moving to new technologies may require us to align to and build a new supply base such as nand flash in the case of nand suppliers many of which are involved in developing storage products such as ssd that in some cases compete with our products our success in these new product areas may be 

dependent on our ability and their willingness to develop close relationships with preferential agreements where this cannot be done our business and operations may be adversely affected 

in addition to an external supply base we also rely on an internal supply chain of heads media and media substrate please see the risk factors entitled “ a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage” and “if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected” for a review of some of the risks related to our internal supply 

  

price volatility shortages of critical materials or components or use by other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry may negatively impact our operating results 

increases in the cost for certain critical materials and components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting our products and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers shortages of critical components such as dram and nand flash or materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of uncertain global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some revolutionary technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic recording heatassisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads magnetic media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however increasing areal density has become more difficult in the storage industry if we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to include more components in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new test equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gigabytes per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

  

if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement these new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

if we do not properly manage new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

as advances in computer hardware and software are made our customers have demanded a more diversified portfolio of products with new and additional features in some cases this demand results in investments in new products for a particular market that do not necessarily expand overall market opportunity which may negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

  



  



  



  



  





our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage issues associated with our product development 

if we fail to develop and introduce new products that are competitive against alternative storage technologies our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with technology advancements storage technologies like solidstate storage have successfully served mobility markets for products that cannot be serviced using hard drive technology advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in solidstate storage emerging as a technology that can be competitive with hard drives for high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers and storage there can be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and developing new products for the pc and other storage markets in response to competing storage technologies if our hard drive and solid state products fail to offer a superior value proposition to alternative storage products we will be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using alternative technology and our business will suffer 

  

our operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and in asia the facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations in asia and elsewhere a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’ other suppliers such as the spread of a pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of our products that we are able to manufacture or sell which would result in substantial harm to our operating results similarly a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities including access to or from these facilities by employees or logistics operators would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results for example prior to the 2011 flooding in thailand all of our internal slider capacity and 60 of our hard drive manufacturing capacity was in thailand as a result of the flooding in thailand our facilities were inundated and temporarily shut down during that period our ability to manufacture hard drives was significantly constrained adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

manufacturing and marketing our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing efforts including 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or freight lanes caused by among other things labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products 

if we sustain system failures cyber attacks to our systems or to our products or other data security breaches we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequences 

we are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure among other functions to operate our factories provide and sell our products and services fulfill orders manage inventory and bill collect and make payments and we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and other countries relating to the collection use and security of user data our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures cyber attacks such as computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events our business is also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees computer programmers hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs or otherwise attack our products to discover or exploit any security vulnerabilities or breach or compromise the security schemes of our products in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 

the foregoing security problems could result in among other consequences loss or theft of our our customers’ or our business partners’ intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we could lose existing or potential customers in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products in addition breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data or personal data or information about us our customers or other third parties could expose us our customers or other affected third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business operating results and financial condition further we rely on thirdparty data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions it may adversely affect our future results 

as part of our growth strategy we have completed and we may continue to pursue acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business for example we completed the acquisition of velobit on july 9 2013 stec on september 12 2013 and virident on october 17 2013 in order to pursue this part of our growth strategy successfully we must continue to identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to continue to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all failing to successfully integrate or realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition may result in not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition failing to achieve the financial model projections for an acquisition may result in the incurrence of impairment charges and other expenses both of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 

please also see the risk factors above for specific risks and uncertainties regarding our acquisition of hgst 

  

the loss of our key executive management staff and skilled employees the inability to hire and integrate new employees or decisions to realign our business could negatively impact our business prospects 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees to attract integrate and retain new skilled employees and to make decisions to realign our business to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key management staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we lose our existing key management staff or skilled employees or are unable to hire and integrate new key management staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key management or staff our operating results would likely be harmed furthermore if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our intended realignment after we make decisions regarding our personnel and implement our realignment plans our operating results could be adversely affected 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers and customers to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on november 18 2011 a sole arbitrator ruled against us in an arbitration in minnesota the arbitration involves claims brought by seagate technology llc against us and a now former employee alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets the arbitrator issued an interim award against us in the amount of 525 million plus preaward interest on january 23 2012 the arbitrator issued a final award adding preaward interest in the amount of 1054 million for a total award of 6304 million on january 23 2012 we filed a petition in the district court of hennepin county minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated and a hearing on the petition was held on march 1 2012 on october 12 2012 the district court of hennepin county minnesota vacated in full the 6304 million final arbitration award and ordered that a rehearing be held concerning certain trade secret claims before a new arbitrator on october 30 2012 seagate initiated an appeal of the district court’s decision with the minnesota court of appeals on july 22 2013 the minnesota court of appeals reversed the district court’s decision and remanded for entry of an order and judgment confirming the arbitration award we strongly disagree with the decision of the court of appeals and believe that the district court’s decision was correct on august 20 2013 the company filed a petition for review with the minnesota supreme court and on october 15 2013 the company was informed that the minnesota supreme court granted the company’s petition the appeal before the minnesota supreme court has been fully briefed and oral argument was held on february 5 2014 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers and customers are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier or customer could negatively impact our business 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes 

to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which could harm our operating results 

  

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade health safety and tax regulations and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade health safety and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our component suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal international or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in connection with our compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain components and metals contained in our products 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use and source of gold tantalum tin and tungsten commonly referred to as 3tg or conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies these new rules require us to determine and report annually whether such 3tg originated from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the first such report was due on june 2 2014 these new rules could affect our ability to source components that contain 3tg or 3tg generally at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of such components or 3tg since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of “conflict free” 3tg our customers including our oem customers may require that our products contain only conflict free 3tg and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement additionally we may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders if our products are not conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the 3tg contained in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement we could incur significant costs to the extent that we are required to make changes to products processes or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures to the extent that proposed conflict minerals legislation is adopted by the european commission or canada these risks could increase 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers or customers could harm our business 

we expect our suppliers and customers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or customers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or customers or divergence of a supplier’s or customer’s business practices from those generally accepted as ethical could harm our business by   



  



  



  



  



  

any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

our payment of quarterly cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock purchase program will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of shares of our common stock are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common stock 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin if this occurs it would have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the united states fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the united states 

we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and term extensions under existing contracts with customers with credit losses could result in an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks our acquisition of hgst has also resulted in an increase to our customer credit risk given that we service many of the same customers any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer especially in situations where there are term extensions under existing contracts with such customers would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including   



  

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

the resale of shares of common stock issued to hitachi in connection with our acquisition of hgst could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

on march 8 2012 as partial consideration for our acquisition of hgst we issued 25 million shares of our common stock to hitachi on november 6 2013 hitachi completed a secondary offering of 125 million of these shares we are required by the terms of an investor rights agreement we entered into with hitachi to file a form s3 registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register the resale by hitachi of the remaining shares of common stock by a date designated by hitachi in consultation with the company and after reasonable prior notice to the company sales of these shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our cash balances and investment portfolio are subject to various risks any of which could adversely impact our financial position 

given the international footprint of our business we have both domestic and international cash balances and investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings security types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market political sovereign and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a material part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities and bank deposits if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that our investments may experience an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could also have an adverse impact on our financial position 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our stock price may be adversely affected 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 27 2014  in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective if our internal control over financial 

reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting in future periods investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our stock price 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could restrict current and future operations or limit our flexibility to take certain actions 

our credit agreement includes covenants relating to our financial performance and financial position in addition our credit agreement restricts our ability to take other actions with respect to our current and future operations including our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or consolidate merge or sell assets our ability to meet these restrictive covenants may be affected by events that could be beyond our control and a breach of these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement which if not cured or waived could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could result in material adverse consequences that negatively impact our business 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received revenue agent reports seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of any tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with loss or nonrenewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met if the tax holidays are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate could increase in the future in addition any actions by us to repatriate nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes may impact our effective tax rate

results of operations 

fiscal 2014  overview 

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” operating results for virident stec velobit and hgst which were acquired on october 17 2013 september 12 2013 july 9 2013 and march 8 2012 respectively are included in our operating results only after the respective dates of acquisition 

in 2014  our net revenue decreased  by 1  to 151 billion  on hard drive shipments of 249 million  units as compared to 154 billion  on shipments of 242 million  units in 2013  in 2014  53 of our net revenue was derived from our enterprise applications branded products and ce products as compared to 50 in 2013  hard drive average selling price “asp” decreased  to 58  in 2014  from 61  in 2013  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased  to 288  in 2014  from 284  in 2013  operating income increased  from 13 billion  in 2013  to 18 billion  in 2014  operating income in 2014 included 95 million of employee termination asset impairment and other charges and 52 million of charges related to an arbitration award as compared to 138 million and 681 million for the same charges in 2013 respectively as a percentage of net revenue operating income was 118  in 2014  compared to 82  in 2013  net income in 2014  was 16 billion  or 668  per diluted share compared to 980 million  or 398  per diluted share in 2013  

for the september quarter we expect overall hard drive industry shipments to increase from the june quarter’s 138 million units primarily as a result of seasonality we expect our revenue in the september quarter to increase slightly as a result of seasonality and an additional week in our first fiscal quarter of 2015 to realign our fiscal quarter ends 

summary comparison of 2014  2013  and 2012   

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue in millions except percentages 

  



the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding unit shipments asps and revenues by geography and channel in millions except percentages and asps 

  



 

 fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013   

net revenue net revenue was 151 billion  for 2014  a decrease  of 1  from 2013  asps were 58 for 2014 a decrease of 3  from 2013 these decreases were primarily due to modest price declines and a change in product mix partially offset by an increase in unit shipments total hard drive shipments in 2014   increased  to 249 million  units as compared to 242 million  units for the prior year primarily due to strength in our consumer electronics solutions including gaming consoles 

changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for each of 2014  and 2013  these programs represented 8 of gross revenues these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

gross profit gross profit for 2014  was 44 billion  a decrease  of 3 million  from the prior year gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to 288  in 2014  as compared to 284  in 2013  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by higher volumes in 2014 as compared to 2013 as well as a continued focus on operational excellence 

operating expenses total research and development “rd” expense and selling general and administrative “sga” expense increase d to 160  of net revenue in 2014  compared to 148  in 2013  rd expense was 17 billion  in 2014  an increase  of 89 million  or 6  over the prior year this increase  was primarily due to the inclusion of virident and stecs rd expenses from the dates of acquisition and the continued investment in product development as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased  to 110  in 2014  compared to 102  in 2013  sga expense was 761 million  in 2014  an increase  of 55 million  or 8  as compared to 2013  this increase  in sga expense was primarily due to the inclusion of virident and stecs sga expenses from the dates of acquisition and the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and growing markets partially offset by a 65 million gain on floodrelated insurance recovery sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased  to 50  in 2014  compared to 46  in 2013  

during 2014  and 2013  we recorded 52 million  and 681 million  respectively for charges related to an arbitration award for claims brought against us and a now former employee by seagate technology llc “seagate” alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets for further detail see the “arbitration award” section below 

during 2014 we recorded 95 million of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 27 million of employee termination benefits 62 million of asset impairment charges and 6 million of other charges during 2013  we recorded 138 million of employee termination asset impairment and other charges these charges consisted of 109 million of employee termination benefits 14 million of asset impairment charges and 15 million of other charges 

other income expense other expense net was 39 million  in 2014  compared to 44 million  in 2013  interest and other income increased  from 11 million  in 2013  to 17 million  in 2014  primarily due to a 3 million gain on the sale of our auctionrate securities in 2014  and a higher average daily invested cash balance for the period interest and other expense increased  from 55 million  in 2013  to 56 million  in 2014  primarily due to a 4 million writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with lenders that extinguished or reduced their participation in our newly entered into credit agreement as defined below offset by lower variable interest rates on our average debt balance in 2014 

income tax provision income tax expense was 135 million  in 2014  as compared to 242 million  in 2013  tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 77  in 2014  compared to 198  in 2013  our income tax provision for 2013 also reflects a tax benefit of 37 million as a result of the retroactive extension of the us federal research and experimentation tax credit “rd credit” that was signed into law on january 2 2013 as part of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the rd credit which had previously expired on december 31 2011 was extended through december 31 2013 in addition we recorded an 88 million charge to reduce our previously recognized california deferred tax assets in fiscal 2013 as a result of the enactment of california proposition 39 california proposition 39 which was approved by california voters on november 6 2012 affects california state income tax apportionment for most multistate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2013 this proposition reduces our future income apportioned to california making it less likely for us to realize certain california deferred tax assets the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2015 through 2025 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

as of june 27 2014  we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 300 million  we recognized a net increase of 60 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2014  interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

the internal revenue service “irs” previously completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and issued revenue agent reports that proposed adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately 970 million primarily related to transfer pricing and intercompany payable balances we disagreed with the proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the irs appeals office in june 2013 we reached an agreement with the irs to resolve the transfer pricing issue this agreement resulted in a decrease in the amount of net operating loss and tax credits realized but did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of income the proposed adjustment relating to intercompany payable balances for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 will be addressed in conjunction with the irs’s examination of our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 which commenced in january 2012 in addition in january 2012 the irs commenced an examination of the 2007 fiscal period ended september 5 2007 of komag incorporated komag which was acquired by us on september 5 2007 in february 2013 the irs commenced an examination of calendar years 2010 and 2011 of hgst which was acquired by us on march 8 2012 

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of june 27 2014  it was not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months any significant change in the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns 

arbitration award 

as disclosed below in part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on november 18 2011 a sole arbitrator ruled against us in an arbitration in minnesota the arbitration involves claims brought by seagate against us and a now former employee alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets the arbitrator issued an interim award against us in the amount of 525 million plus preaward interest on january 23 2012 the arbitrator issued a final award adding preaward interest in the amount of 1054 million for a total award of 6304 million on january 23 2012 we filed a petition in the district court of hennepin county minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated and a hearing on the petition to vacate was held on march 1 2012 on october 12 2012 the district court of hennepin county minnesota vacated in full the 6304 million final arbitration award 

and ordered that a rehearing be held concerning certain trade secret claims before a new arbitrator on october 30 2012 seagate initiated an appeal of the district courts decision with the minnesota court of appeals on july 22 2013 the minnesota court of appeals reversed the district courts decision and remanded for entry of an order and judgment confirming the arbitration award we strongly disagree with the decision of the court of appeals and believe that the district court’s decision was correct on august 20 2013 we filed a petition for review with the minnesota supreme court and on october 15 2013 we were informed that the minnesota supreme court granted our petition the appeal before the minnesota supreme court was fully briefed and oral argument was held on february 5 2014 we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter in light of uncertainties with respect to this matter we recorded an accrual of 681 million for this matter in fiscal 2013 this amount was in addition to the 25 million previously accrued in fiscal 2011 in 2014  we recorded an additional 52 million  for interest related to the arbitration award as a result the total amount accrued of 758 million  represents the amount of the final arbitration award plus interest accrued on the initial arbitration award at the statutory rate of 10 from january 24 2012 through june 27 2014

net revenue net revenue was 154 billion for 2013 an increase of 23 from 2012 total hard drive shipments in 2013 increased to 242 million units as compared to 202 million units for the prior year the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from the contribution of a full year of hgst operations partially offset by continued soft industry demand as well as a 1 decrease in asp from 62 to 61 

changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2013 these programs represented 8 of gross revenues compared to 6 in 2012 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

gross profit gross profit for 2013 was 44 billion an increase of 725 million or 20 from the prior year gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 284 in 2013 from 292 in 2012 this percentage decrease was primarily due to a decrease in asp as well as 101 million of incremental amortization reflecting a full year of amortization for intangibles related to the acquisition of hgst 

operating expenses total rd expense and sga expense increased to 148 of net revenue in 2013 compared to 126 in 2012 rd expense was 16 billion in 2013 an increase of 517 million or 49 over the prior year this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of hgst’s rd expense for the full year period as well as continued investment in product development to support new programs as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 102 in 2013 compared to 85 in 2012 sga expense was 706 million in 2013 an increase of 188 million or 36 as compared to 2012 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of hgst’s sga expense and amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of hgst partially offset by the inclusion of acquisitionrelated expenses in the prioryear period sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 46 in 2013 compared to 42 in 2012 

during 2013 we recorded a 681 million charge related to an arbitration award for claims brought against us and a now former employee by seagate alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets 

during 2013 we recorded 138 million of employee termination benefits and other charges these charges consisted of 109 million of employee termination benefits 14 million of asset impairment charges and 15 million of other charges during 2012 we recorded 56 million of asset impairment charges 16 million of contract termination and other exit costs and 8 million of employee termination benefits in addition during 2012 we recorded 214 million of net charges related to the flooding in thailand including 119 million of fixed asset impairments 61 million of recovery charges 28 million of writedowns of damaged inventory and 27 million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities partially offset by 21 million of insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements 

other income expense other expense net was 44 million in 2013 compared to 14 million in 2012 interest and other income decreased slightly from 12 million in 2012 to 11 million in 2013 primarily due to a lower average daily invested cash balance for the period interest and other expense increased from 26 million in 2012 to 55 million in 2013 primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance since the acquisition of hgst 

income tax provision income tax expense was 242 million in 2013 as compared to 145 million in 2012 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 198 in 2013 compared to 83 in 2012 our income tax provision for 2013 also reflects a tax benefit of 37 million as a result of the retroactive extension of the rd credit that was signed into law 

on january 2 2013 as part of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the rd credit which had previously expired on december 31 2011 was extended through december 31 2013 in addition we recorded an 88 million charge to reduce our previously recognized california deferred tax assets in fiscal 2013 as a result of the enactment of california proposition 39 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2014 through 2025 the current year generation of income tax credits and the effect of california proposition 39 

as of june 28 2013 we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 240 million we recognized a net decrease of 40 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2013 interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

liquidity and capital resources 

we ended 2014  with total cash and cash equivalents of 48 billion  an increase  of 495 million  from june 28 2013  the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended june 27 2014  in millions 

  



  

our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds on january 9 2014 the outstanding balance on the existing credit facility entered into on march 8 2012 the prior credit facility was repaid the prior credit facility was terminated and we along with western digital technologies inc wdt and wdi entered into a new credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto the credit agreement the credit agreement provides for 40 billion of unsecured loan facilities consisting of a 25 billion term loan facility to wdt and a 15 billion revolving credit facility to wdt and wdi the borrowers subject to certain conditions a borrower may also elect to expand the credit facilities by or obtain incremental term loans of up to 10 billion if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments for additional information on the prior credit facility and the credit agreement see part ii item 8 note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt dividend stock repurchase and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

a total of 35 billion and 28 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the united states at june 27 2014  and june 28 2013  respectively substantially all of the amounts held outside of the united states are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations if we are required to pay the arbitration award described in the section “arbitration award” above the award would be paid from one of our foreign subsidiaries using cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states on september 13 2012 our board of directors approved a capital allocation plan which includes repurchases of our common stock and the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations or capital allocation plan in the event funds from foreign operations are needed in the united states any repatriation could result in the accrual and payment of additional us income tax 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 28 billion  in 2014  as compared to 31 billion  in both 2013  and 2012  cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash used in working capital changes was 234 million  for 2014  as compared to net cash provided by working capital changes of 715 million  and 324 million  for 2013  and 2012  respectively 

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the average quarterly cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2014  were as follows 

  



for 2014  our average days sales outstanding “dsos” increased  by 5  days days in inventory “dios” increased  by 2  days and days payables outstanding “dpos” increased  by 1  day changes in average dsos and dios are generally related to linearity of shipments and the timing of inventory builds respectively changes in dpos are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period in 2012 the higher dpos were primarily due to the impact of including hgst’s accounts payable balances as of june 29 2012  but only including hgst’s cost of sales from the date of acquisition from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for 2014  was 19 billion  as compared to 970 million  for 2013  and 42 billion  for 2012  during 2014  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 823 million related to acquisitions net of cash acquired 628 million  of capital expenditures 561 million  related to the purchase of investments and 4 million of other investing activities net offset by 72 million of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments during 2013 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 952 million of capital expenditures and 17 million related to the purchase of investments capital expenditures in 2014 and 2012 consisted of charges related to the normal replacement of existing assets capital expenditures in 2013 primarily consisted of flood recovery and increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio during 2012 cash used in investing activities consisted of 35 billion net of cash acquired used for the acquisitions 76 million of proceeds related to the sale of equipment and capital expenditures of 717 million 

our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market funds that are invested in us treasury securities and us government agency securities in addition we invest directly in us treasury securities us government agency securities commercial paper bank acceptances and certificates of deposit during 2014 we sold our entire 14 million portfolio of auctionrate securities resulting in a gain of 3 million which was included in interest and other income in the consolidated statements of income 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 385 million  for 2014  and 10 billion  for 2013  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 819 million  for 2012  net cash used in financing activities for 2014  consisted of 25 billion of debt proceeds related to the term loan facility under the credit agreement net of issuance costs 500 million of debt proceeds related to the revolving credit facility under the prior credit facility and a net 215 million provided by employee stock plans offset by 25 billion used to repay the prior credit facility and make principal payments on the credit agreement as well as 816 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and 259 million used to pay dividends on our common stock net cash used in financing activities for 2013 consisted of 842 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock 181 million used to pay dividends on our common stock and 230 million used to repay longterm debt partially offset by a net 205 million provided by employee stock plans net cash provided by financing activities for 2012 consisted of the 28 billion of proceeds borrowed under the credit facility in connection with the acquisition of hgst net of issuance costs and a net 141 million provided by employee stock plans partially offset by 604 million used to repurchase stock and 15 billion used to repay our outstanding debt as well as debt assumed in the acquisition of hgst 

offbalance sheet arrangements

arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have an interest in or relationships with any specialpurpose entities 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following is a summary of our known contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of june 27 2014  in millions 

  

 

 longterm debt 

on march 8 2012 we in our capacity as the parent entity and guarantor and the borrowers entered into the prior credit facility the prior credit facility provided for 28 billion of unsecured loan facilities consisting of a 23 billion term loan facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility on january 9 2014 the outstanding balance on the prior credit facility was repaid the prior credit facility was terminated and the new credit agreement was entered into 

as of june 27 2014  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility of the credit agreement and the term loan facility had an outstanding balance of 24 billion  and a variable interest rate of 17  we are required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loan facility totaling 125 million  in fiscal 2015  156 million in fiscal 2016  219 million in fiscal 2017  250 million in fiscal 2018  and the remaining balance of 17 billion  in fiscal 2019  for additional information see part ii item 8 note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

the credit agreement requires the company to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated basis for the company and its subsidiaries in addition the credit agreement contains customary covenants including covenants that limit or restrict the company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens incur indebtedness make certain restricted payments merge or consolidate and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements and customary events of default as of june 27 2014  the company was in compliance with all covenants 

purchase orders 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers containing minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future 

purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to commitments 

foreign exchange contracts 

we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and part ii item 8 notes 1 and 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements   

unrecognized tax benefits 

as of june 27 2014  the cash portion of our total recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 246 million we estimate the timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within the next one to eight years see part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our total tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

stock repurchase program 

since may 18 2012 our board of directors has authorized 30 billion for the repurchase of our common stock and the extension of our stock repurchase program until september 13 2017 we repurchased 103 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 816 million  in 2014  the remaining amount available to be purchased under our stock repurchase program as of june 27 2014  was 12 billion subsequent to june 27 2014  and through august 14 2014 we repurchased an additional 20 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 203 million we may continue to repurchase our common stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a rule 10b51 plan we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows and borrowings under our credit agreement 

cash dividend policy 

on september 13 2012 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy under the cash dividend policy holders of our common stock receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors in 2014  we declared aggregate cash dividends of 125  per share of our common stock totaling 295 million  of which 201 million  was paid during 2014  on august 5 2014 we announced that our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 040 per share of our common stock to shareholders of record as of october 3 2014 which will be paid on october 15 2014 we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time see part ii item 5 included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues 

expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue and accounts receivable 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information and customer claim processing if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differs from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product generally total sales incentive and marketing programs range from 7 to 11 of gross revenues per quarter for 2014 sales incentive and marketing programs were 8 of gross revenues changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 07 of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2012 customer sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could materially affect operating results 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

warranty 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated replacement costs estimated repair costs which include scrap costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross profit and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value we use the firstin firstout “fifo” method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories while we use the weightedaverage method to value precious metal inventories weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at 

the time the inventory is used in production the weightedaverage method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a fifo method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

stockbased compensation 

we account for all stockbased compensation at fair value stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options and cashsettled stock appreciation rights “sars” granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan purchase rights are estimated using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model we account for sars as liability awards based upon our intention to settle such awards in cash the sars liability is recognized for that portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date the sharebased liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date with amounts exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we either use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired or we perform a twostep approach to quantify impairment if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we are required to follow a twostep approach to quantify the impairment we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired in business combinations and inprocess research and development inprocess research and development is not amortized until the point at which it reaches technological feasibility instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired acquired intangibles are amortized on a straightline basis over their respective estimated useful lives longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition refer to part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated by reference in response to this item 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

as of june 27 2014  we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

  



 

 in 2014  2013  and 2012  total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

disclosure about other market risks 

variable interest rate risk 

on january 9 2014 the outstanding balance on the prior credit facility was repaid the prior credit facility was terminated and we entered into the new credit agreement 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of the applicable borrower either a a customary london interbank offered rate a “eurodollar rate” or b a customary base rate a “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margins range from 125 to 200 with respect to eurodollar rate borrowings and 025 to 100 with respect to base rate borrowings the borrowers are also required to pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility which ranges from 0175 to 0300 per annum the applicable margins for borrowings and the commitment fee ranges are determined based upon a leverage ratio of us and our subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan and revolving credit facility would increase interest expense by approximately 24 million annually for additional information see part ii item 8 note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 1992  based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see page 51 herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 27 2014  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business 

general 

we are an industryleading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions that enable people to create manage experience and preserve digital content we design and make storage devices and home entertainment products under the hgst wd and gtechnology brands our principal products today are hard drives that use one or more rotating magnetic disks “magnetic media” to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are today’s primary storage medium for digital content over the last 10 years we have achieved consistent profitable growth with revenues up 19 and earnings per share up 16 on a compounded annual growth rate basis 

we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on an important longterm secular growth trend — the ongoing expansion in digital data — which is linked directly to consumers’ and commercial enterprises’ increasingly ubiquitous experience with digital data we believe this growth will continue with total exabytes “eb” shipped growing from 600 eb in calendar 2012 to at least 5900 eb by calendar 2020 representing a 34 compounded annual growth rate we believe eb growth is the most relevant measure of the growth potential for the industry and our company 

the growth in the global market for digital data storage solutions is being driven by several factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we are a market and customer driven company focused on growth innovation and value creation for our customers employees and shareholders we develop deep and collaborative relationships with customers an approach that is being manifested in our role as a trusted advisor and market maker in all served markets we believe this approach is one of the key factors that will help us continue to achieve strong business performance we believe our platform is powerful with growth drivers and unique competitive advantages that will continue to provide us the opportunity to expand our valuecreation model within an evolving and growing storage market 

we operate our global business through two independent subsidiaries due to regulatory requirements — hgst and wd both longtime innovators in the storage industry as of june 28 2013 we had approximately 9200 engineers and one of the industry’s largest patent portfolios with more than 6000 active patents worldwide 

our headquarters are located in irvine california wdc was founded in 1970 as a specialized semiconductor manufacturer and since entering the storage industry in 1988 its wd subsidiary has been a technology standardsetter in the industry’s highest volume markets hgst known as hitachi global storage technologies holdings pte ltd until shortly before its acquisition by wdc “the acquisition” in march 2012 was founded in 2003 through the combination of the hard drive businesses of international business machines corporation the inventor of the hard drive and hitachi ltd “hitachi” for a further description of our acquisition of hgst in march 2012 see part ii item 8 note 14 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

hgst and wd have relationships with a full range of customers currently addressing storage opportunities these include storage subsystem suppliers internet and social media infrastructure players and personal computer “pc” and mac™ providers through hgst and wd we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers “oems” distributors resellers and consumers wd has a strong brand and heritage with consumers with its wd branded products business hgst enjoys the same with its gtechnology branded products 

we believe we are at the forefront of helping our customers meet the evolving storage needs of end users through innovation and value creation examples of these efforts include our multiplatter high capacity drives and solidstate drives for the fast growing cloud computing storage market our lowprofile hard drives to address the emerging thin and light ultrabook tm pc and tablet markets and our connected life innovations for the home and smalltomedium sized businesses “smbs” 

the storage market in which we operate is rapidly changing and evolving to address these dynamics we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve or in markets where we seek to broaden our participation and augment our resources and capabilities examples include our recent actions to strengthen our solid state drive business with the pending acquisition of stec inc “stec” our acquisition of velobit inc and our investment in skyera inc as well as our acquisition of arkeia software solutions inc to strengthen our smbs solutions in our branded products business 

through our investments and acquisitions we seek to develop strategic relationships with technology innovators in the broader storage market to enable our customers to develop highly optimized storage solutions that meet their changing data management needs we believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market participation and be a fullline data storage solutions supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the recent past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions 

industry 

storage is increasingly critical to the large amount of digital content being created and utilized we believe the growth in the number of computing users and connected mobile devices in the world is unabated creating more usage and more digital content to be stored cloud computing applications are especially noteworthy given that they create multiple copies of photos videos and other content to ensure efficient distribution and security we believe unit volumes in the hard drive industry were down 9 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 reflecting continued soft industry demand driven by macroeconomic uncertainty and weak pc demand 

client desktop and notebook pcs 

the pc market which includes notebook and desktop pcs comprises the client market and has declined in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 due to weak global macroeconomic conditions and the popularity of tablet devices we are encouraged by recent signs of innovation in the pc space such as new ultraportable pc designs that are thinner lighter and faster than prior generation notebook pcs this remains a significant market for us however our reliance on the pc market is declining with cloud traditional enterprise branded and other solutions accounting for 50 of our net revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared to 36 in fiscal 2012 

client storage devices consist of internal hard drives and solidstate drives for desktop and mobile pcs we believe industry unit shipments of mobile hard drives into the client space declined 14 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 while volumes of desktop hard drives declined 11 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 

desktop pcs are intended for regular use at single locations in homes and businesses as well as in multiuser educational and government networks mobile pcs primarily notebook computers are used both in and away from homes and businesses we believe that the demand for client computer hard drives and solidstate drives will continue primarily due to demand in emerging countries corporate refreshes the proliferation of digital content and changing requirements for increasing performance and thinner and lighter devices with lower power consumption 

  

mobile hard drives for notebook pcs the industry’s highest volume market have traditionally been in a 25inch form factor with a 95 mm height we believe we have led a trend toward thinner lighter devices with extended battery life and low power consumption first with our family of 7 mm height drives and more recently with our 5 mm height drives in both traditional hard drive and hybrid drive configurations a solidstate hybrid drive is a form of a hard drive that incorporates nand flash technology in the caching function solidstate hybrid drives specifically designed for mobile computing combine the power and performance of solidstate drives with the capacity affordability and availability attributes of hard drives 

enterprise 

we believe shipments into the enterprise market of the storage industry remained relatively flat in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 enterprise storage devices consist of performance and capacity hard drives as well as enterprise class solidstate drives all of these devices are used in multiple types of enterprise datacenters that provide storage for a range of cloud and corporate applications within datacenters these drives are typically used in servers and storage systems 

performance applications are essential to the operations of an enterprise and require the greatest capabilities and reliability in hard drives and solidstate drives this class of drives is the most highly engineered product line in the storage industry the infrastructure to support cloud computing storage is driving the demand for multiplatter high capacity hard drives and enterprise class solidstate drives in tiered architectures cloud computing delivers shared resources software and information to users on demand on a multitude of devices such as client pcs tablets and smart phones most cloud computing models consist of services delivered through large datacenters with enterpriseclass servers utilizing tiered architectures to address multiple levels of storage needs we believe we have established a leading position in supplying advanced multiplatter high capacity drives and solidstate drives with serial attached scsi small computer system interface “sas” to address these needs 

we believe that capacity hard drives performance hard drives and solidstate drives represented 49 46 and 5 of the industry unit shipments into enterprise systems in fiscal 2013 respectively 

branded products 

external storage devices supplement the storage space of pc systems for home and small office networks and through wireless connections provide remote access to personal content the highest volume products include directattached and networkattached external drives they are ideally suited to back up data on internal drives because of their portability and security features we believe hard drive shipments into the external storage market increased 42 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 branded products also include media players that connect to a user’s television or home theater system and play digital movies music and photos from an integrated hard drive universal serial bus “usb” mass storage device or content services accessed over the internet 

consumer electronics 

hard drives for ce products are primarily used in digital video recorders “dvrs” game consoles and security video recording systems we believe hard drive unit shipments into the ce market declined 22 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 

dvrs offer greater consumer viewing flexibility and enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program game consoles enable users to save games movies music pictures and other user generated content we believe growth in the ce market will continue to create demand for higher capacity hard drives 

competition 

we compete with manufacturers of hard drives for client compute client noncompute and enterprise applications and manufacturers of solidstate drives competition in the hard drive market consists of five principal brands hgst samsung seagate toshiba and wd in solidstate products we compete with a wide range of manufacturers from small startup companies to multinational corporations including fusion io inc intel corporation micron technology inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation seagate technology llc and toshiba corporation 

  

the storage industry is increasingly utilizing tiered architectures with hard drives and solidstate drives or solid state hybrid drives to address an expanding set of use cases and applications hard drives are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards and we believe there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products hard drive attributes include product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market and we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors semiconductor media or solidstate technology provides high performance attributes in some enterpriseclass applications and attractive functionality in consumer handheld applications requiring smaller form factors lower power and less storage capacity such as smart phones and tablets with advances in our own solidstate enterprise business coupled with recent actions to strengthen those resources through acquisitions we believe we are positioned to compete successfully in the enterpriseclass solidstate segment of this market advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could also result in competitive products for storing digital content with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis 

business strategy

technology and product development 

hard drives 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 industrystandard interfaces allow the drives to communicate with the host system the primary interface for pcs is sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are sas fibre channel and sata 

the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” 

the hda includes heads magnetic media head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner and a pivotarm module on which the individual heads including suspension are mounted each disk surface has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a power device that controls the motor and hsa positioner and a systemonchip “soc” comprised of a drive interface controller and recording channel the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

the storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density track density multiplied by bit density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area head and magnetic media technologies are two of the key technology components of hard drives affecting areal density we develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in our hard drive products as areal density increases achieving a given drive capacity potentially reduces product costs over time through reduced component requirements we also invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

solidstate drives 

solidstate drives use semiconductor nonvolatile media rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads to store and allow fast access to data without any moving parts the cost per bit of solidstate drives is more expensive than hard drives but the higher inputoutput “io” performance makes solidstate drives an attractive new tier of storage that fits between dram memory and hard drives solidstate drives are finding growing usage in enterprise storage systems and servers in applications that demand the highest io performance 

  

the nonvolatile memory in use today for solidstate drives is nand flash technology while single level cell “slc” flash provides the highest endurance and performance the optimal balance of price and performance is usually achieved through the use of multilevel cell “mlc” flash multiple nand flash die are used on a single pcba and connected in parallel through a controller to the host bus various performance classes of solidstate drives are created by varying the number of parallel nand channels and the speed of controller logic and firmware the controller contains hardware logic and firmware to buffer the data flow to and from the host to the nand flash and to manage the reliability and performance of the nand flash media 

the typical host interfaces for solidstate drives include pcie sas and sata pcie products typically offer the highest performance and come on edge cards that plug into the pcie bus pcie defines the hardware and electrical interface but the software protocols are still proprietary today new standards such as nvme and scsi express are emerging to bring more standardized software protocols for communicating with pcie solidstate drives sas and sata products utilize standardized interfaces similar to hard drives and come in 25inch form factors with differing package heights depending on the application and usage the typical power consumption for the sas and sata interfaces is similar to hard drives while the power consumption of pcie form factor devices is typically higher 

solidstate hybrid drives 

solidstate hybrid drives combine semiconductor nonvolatile memory typically nand flash and magnetic rotating storage in one device the capacity of the nonvolatile memory is typically 8 gb to 32 gb the prevalent usage of these hybrid drives is in notebook computers the nonvolatile memory and control electronics are mounted on the same board as the hdd electronics and share the same host sata interface as hard drives the nonvolatile memory is utilized as a nonvolatile cache to enhance inputoutput performance to reduce latency on boot up of the system and to reduce power consumption by allowing the hard drive to spin down more often the key challenges of adding the nonvolatile memory to the hard drive card are in adding the control electronics for the nand flash the firmware to manage the nand flash qualifying the nand flash memory for use in this application and the algorithms and new software commands sets to manage data between the nonvolatile memory the hdd and the host system 

our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of risks related to technological innovations see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

sales and distribution 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of united states “us” companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 78 81 and 83 of our net revenue for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international customers see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and providing information and support through our web site in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale datacenter operators  purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes as a result for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations 

  

distributors we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our web sites 

for 2013 and 2011 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for 2012 sales to hewlett packard company accounted for 11 of our net revenue for a discussion of risks related to our customers refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customer information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year as a result of increased customer spending seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of risks related to seasonality in our business see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing or recertification of returned products for our customers for a further discussion of our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and be able to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume and utilization low cost assembly and testing and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestinclass technology and manufacturing capacity 

hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs for our nonhard drive products we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of risks related to manufacturing see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

  

materials and supplies 

we use a number of components equipment goods and services in the manufacturing of our products the key components of our hard drives are magnetic heads magnetic media suspensions with related head gimbal assemblies “hgas” and hsas spindle motors custom and standard electronics such as soc magnetic media motor controllers preamps and printed circuit boards base and top covers and magnets and related voice coil motors 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for our hard drives we acquire all of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers the major components used in the manufacture of our solidstate drives the semiconductor media and soc and in our media players the controller are also acquired from third party suppliers we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of risks related to our component supplies see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we have more than 6000 patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action

as of june 28 2013 we employed a total of 85777 employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement a majority of our employees in japan are subject to a collective bargaining agreement in addition each of our three manufacturing subsidiaries in china has its own labor union of which many of each subsidiary’s direct employees are members our three manufacturing subsidiaries in china are not currently subject to collective bargaining agreements however the government has required that they begin collective bargaining negotiations in calendar 2013 we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of risks related to our skilled employees see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors tableend if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hgst on a timely basis or at all our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of hgst we agreed to certain conditions required by the ministry of commerce of the people’s republic of china “mofcom” including adopting measures to keep hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agrees otherwise with the minimum period being two years from the march 8 2012 closing date of the acquisition we worked closely with mofcom to finalize an operations plan that outlines in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement compliance with these measures has affected and may continue to affect our business and financial conditions in the following ways 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot predict when the conditions imposed by mofcom will be removed in addition in the event we fail to comply with these measures the time during which we are required to comply with the conditions could be extended and we could be subject to other conditions or penalties that could adversely affect the business 

  

the financing of the hgst acquisition may have an adverse impact on our liquidity limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  

our acquisition of hgst was financed by a combination of the issuance of additional shares of our common stock the use of a significant amount of our cash on hand and the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness the use of cash on hand and indebtedness to finance the acquisition reduced our liquidity and could cause us to place more reliance on cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and development activities the credit agreement we entered into with respect to the indebtedness we incurred to finance the acquisition contains restrictive covenants including financial covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control the indebtedness and these restrictive covenants will also have the effect among other things of impairing our ability to obtain additional financing if needed limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions in addition a breach of the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement which if not cured or waived could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our acquisition of hgst we divested certain assets to toshiba and agreed to provide certain support services for those assets for a period of time and our business will be adversely affected in the event we fail to successfully meet our obligations to toshiba under the divestiture transaction 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our acquisition of hgst we agreed subject to review by regulatory agencies in certain jurisdictions to divest certain assets to toshiba that will expand toshiba’s capacity to manufacture 35inch hard drives for the desktop consumer electronics and nearline business critical applications while this divestiture transaction closed in may 2012 we agreed to provide certain support service for those assets for a period of time if we are not able to meet our continuing service obligations under our agreement with toshiba the jurisdictions that conditioned their approval of the hgst acquisition on the divestiture could impose certain obligations on us including a requirement that we divest the assets subject to the toshiba divestiture or other assets to another purchaser which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these global economic and credit market conditions include the following 

 

  

  

   

 we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to the risk of declining average selling prices “asps” volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

demand for our hard drives depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition if more intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could adversely impact revenue and gross margins our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors along with others may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants including a substantial decrease in our market share 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and industry consolidation resulting in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments in addition because hard drives are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs possibly resulting in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

we experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for hard drives however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

  

our sales to the noncompute and enterprise markets collectively the “nonpc markets” representing an increasing percentage of our overall revenue may not continue to grow at current estimates which could materially adversely impact our operating results 

the secular growth of digital data is resulting in a more diversified mix of revenue for example for the year ended june 28 2013 approximately 50 of our net revenue was derived from the nonpc markets as sales to the nonpc markets become a more significant portion of our revenue events or circumstances that adversely impact demand in these markets or our ability to address that demand successfully could materially adversely impact our operating results for example demand in or our sales to the nonpc markets may be adversely affected by the following 

 

  

  

  

 in addition demand in the nonpc markets also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management the emergence of processes such as data deduplication and storage virtualization and the rate of increase in areal density exceeding the increase in our customers’ demand for storage these factors could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products that we do not offer thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand for storage our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results 

sales in the client compute market the “pc market” are important to our business and if we fail to respond to changes in the pc market our operating results could suffer 

while sales to the nonpc market are becoming a more significant source of revenue sales to the pc market remain an important part of our business the pc market however has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the growth of tablet computers smart phones and similar devices that perform many of the same capabilities as pcs the lengthening of product life cycles and macroeconomic conditions if demand in the pc market is worse than expected as a result of these or other conditions demand for our products in the pc market may decrease and our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels including the etail channel adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd ®  hgst™ or gtechnology™ brand products our operating results may be adversely affected 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the year ended june 28 2013 44 of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms often resulting in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

our entry into additional markets increases the complexity of our business and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

as we expand our product line to sell into additional markets the overall complexity of our business increases at an accelerated rate and we become subject to different market dynamics the new markets into which we are expanding or may expand may have different characteristics from the markets we currently serve these different characteristics may include among other things demand volume requirements demand seasonality product generation development rates customer concentrations warranty and product return policies and performance and compatibility requirements our failure to make the necessary adaptations to our business model and product offerings to address these different characteristics complexities and new market dynamics could adversely affect our operating results 

  

expansion into new markets may cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we do not successfully expand into new markets our business may suffer 

to remain a significant supplier in the storage industry we will need to offer a broad range of storage products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch or 25inch hard drives for the pc and nonpc storage markets as well as a variety of solid state drives however demand for storage devices may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer but which we do not expansion into other markets and resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may require us to make substantial additional investments in part because our operations are largely vertically integrated if we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products 

our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality increasing capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks for our business 

under our business plan we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition as a result of our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves in addition as a result of adverse labor rates or availability we may be required to increase investments in automation which may cause our capital expenditures to increase if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

we make significant investments in research and development to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

over the past several years our business strategy has been to derive a competitive advantage by moving from being a follower of new technologies to being a leader in the innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in research and development and in attempting to remain competitive we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model there can be no assurance that these investments will result in viable technologies or products or if these investments do result in viable technologies or products that they will be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is also critical to the success of our business we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage 

  

industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

the storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside of storage products may over extended periods of time sell storage products at prices that we cannot profitably match 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside of storage products because they do not depend solely on sales of storage products to achieve profitability they may sell storage products at lower prices and operate their storage business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonstorage products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their storage products at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our hard drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition a product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or customer relationships and may cause us to lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

  

dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays lost revenue or increased costs 

our future operating results may depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines as such the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts from reliable component suppliers to do so we must maintain effective relationships with our supply base to source our component needs develop compatible technology and maintain continuity of supply at reasonable costs if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our supply base or if we fail to integrate components from our suppliers effectively this may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver the best products to our customers and our profitability could suffer 

certain equipment and consumables we use in our manufacturing or testing processes are available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment and consumables use materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

each of the following could also significantly harm our operating results 

 

  

  

  

  

 failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components technology or production equipment for our products may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on suppliers for various component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves such as semiconductors motors flex circuits and suspensions likewise we rely on suppliers for certain technology and equipment necessary for advanced development technology for future products some of these components and most of this technology and production equipment must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of whom are our solesource suppliers we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated into our products and technology and production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently as consolidation in the hard drive supply chain increases these suppliers may reevaluate their business models the failure of these suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components technology and production equipment for our products or a decision by these suppliers to exit this industry may cause us to be unable to or experience a delay in our ability to manufacture and ship hard drive products expand into new technology and markets or compete with alternative storage technologies therefore adversely affecting our business and financial results in addition these suppliers may seek to impose volume guarantees on us or to shift the burden of certain fixed costs to us in order to continue developing and manufacturing components technology or production equipment for our products each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

  

price volatility shortages of commodity materials or commodity components or use by other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry may negatively impact our operating results 

increases in the cost for certain commodity materials commodity components and oil may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives and key components and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers shortages of commodity components such as dram and nand flash or commodity materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals or increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other commodity components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of uncertain global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some revolutionary technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic recording energy assisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads magnetic media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however increasing areal density has become more difficult in the storage industry if we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to include more components in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gigabytes per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

  

if we do not properly manage technology transitions our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement these new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

if we do not properly manage new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

as advances in computer hardware and software are made our customers have demanded a more diversified portfolio of disk drive products with new and additional features in some cases this demand results in investments in new products for a particular market that do not necessarily expand overall market opportunity which may negatively affect our operating results 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage issues associated with our product development 

if we fail to develop and introduce new products that are competitive against alternative storage technologies our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with competing technologies alternative storage technologies like solidstate storage technology have successfully served digital entertainment markets for products such as digital cameras mp3 players usb flash drives mobile phones and tablet devices that cannot be economically serviced using hard drive technology advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in solidstate storage emerging as a technology that is competitive with hard drives for high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers and storage there can be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and developing new products for the pc and nonpc storage markets in response to solidstate storage as well as other competing technologies if our hard drive technology fails to offer higher capacity performance and reliability with lower costpergigabyte than solidstate storage we will be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology and our business will suffer 

  

our manufacturing operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities subjecting us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our manufacturing operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and in asia the manufacturing facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations in asia and elsewhere a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’ other suppliers such as the spread of a pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture or sell which would result in substantial harm to our operating results similarly a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities including access to or from these facilities by employees or logistics operations would significantly affect our ability to manufacture or sell hard drives which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results for example prior to the 2011 flooding in thailand all of our internal slider capacity and 60 of our hard drive manufacturing capacity was in thailand as a result of the flooding in thailand our facilities were inundated and temporarily shut down during that period our ability to manufacture hard drives was significantly constrained adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture hard drives and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

manufacturing and marketing our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing efforts including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or freight lanes caused by among other things labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures or attacks which could harm our business 

we are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure among other functions to operate our factories sell our products fulfill orders manage inventory and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures cyberattacks such as computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events our business is also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences loss or theft of our our customers’ or our business partners’ intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information damage to our reputation interruptions in our business and remediation costs each of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions it may adversely affect our future results 

as part of our growth strategy we may pursue acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transaction some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all if we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our future results of operations could be adversely affected 

please also see the risk factors above for specific risks and uncertainties regarding our acquisition of hgst 

  

if we are unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our business results may suffer 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as well as attract integrate and retain new skilled employees volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted by global economic conditions we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff our operating results would likely be harmed 

the nature of our industry and its reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us and our suppliers and customers to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on november 18 2011 a sole arbitrator ruled against us in an arbitration in minnesota the arbitration involves claims brought by seagate technology llc against us and a now former employee alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets the arbitrator issued an interim award against us in the amount of 525 million plus preaward interest on january 23 2012 the arbitrator issued a final award adding preaward interest in the amount of 1054 million for a total award of 6304 million on january 23 2012 we filed a petition in the district court of hennepin county minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated and a hearing on the petition was held on march 1 2012 on october 12 2012 the district court of hennepin county minnesota vacated in full the 6304 million final arbitration award and ordered that a rehearing be held concerning certain trade secret claims before a new arbitrator on october 30 2012 seagate initiated an appeal of the district court’s decision with the minnesota court of appeals oral arguments in the appeal were held on april 24 2013 on july 22 2013 the minnesota court of appeals reversed the district court’s decision and remanded for entry of an order and judgment confirming the arbitration award we strongly disagree with the decision of the court of appeals believe that the district court’s decision was correct and will file a petition for review with the minnesota supreme court if the minnesota supreme court elects not to hear our petition for review or affirms the court of appeals decision the district court is expected to enter an order and judgment confirming the 6304 million final arbitration award plus postaward interest on the 525 million initial award at the statutory rate of 10 from january 24 2012 no judgment will be entered while we are petitioning the minnesota supreme court 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results in addition our suppliers and customers are subject to similar risks of litigation and a material adverse ruling against a supplier or customer could negatively impact our business 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

  

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade and tax regulations and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs 

we are subject to and may become subject to additional state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our component suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs for example in august 2012 the securities and exchange commission adopted final rules to implement section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries which obligates us to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry with respect to conflict minerals included in components of products we directly manufacture contract to manufacture and purchase to include in products other legislation has been and may in the future be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation in the united states is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers or customers could harm our business 

we expect our suppliers and customers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or customers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or customers or divergence of a supplier’s or customer’s business practices from those generally accepted as ethical could harm our business by 

 

  

  

  

  

   

failure to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

our payment of quarterly cash dividends will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends is reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common stock 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar weakens against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin if this occurs it would have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the united states fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the united states 

we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks our acquisition of hgst has also resulted in an increase to our customer credit risk given that we service many of the same customers any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the stock prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the stock of public companies including us these broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock for example expectations concerning general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

the resale of shares of common stock issued to hitachi in connection with our acquisition of hgst could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

on march 8 2012 as partial consideration for our acquisition of hgst we issued 25 million shares of our common stock to hitachi we are required by the terms of an investor rights agreement we entered into with hitachi to file a form s3 registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on or before august 28 2013 to register the resale by hitachi of these shares of common stock sales of these shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock further because we do not know when or in what amounts hitachi may seek to sell these shares of common stock uncertainty about the market price of our common stock could extend for a significant period of time and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

  

current economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from financial institution failures 

the uncertain global economic conditions and volatile investment markets have caused us to hold more cash and cash equivalents than we would hold under normal circumstances since there has been an overall increase in demand for lowrisk us governmentbacked securities with a limited supply in the financial marketplace we face increased difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and other financial institutions a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could have an adverse impact on our financial position 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our stock price may be adversely affected 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 28 2013 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting in future periods investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our stock price 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received revenue agent reports seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of the notice of proposed adjustment and the audits are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations net income or cash flows

our company 

we are an industryleading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions that enable people to create manage experience and preserve digital content we design and make storage devices and home entertainment products under the hgst wd and gtechnology brands our principal products today are hard drives that use one or more rotating magnetic disks “magnetic media” to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are today’s primary storage medium for digital content we operate our global business through two independent subsidiaries due to regulatory requirements—hgst and wd both longtime innovators in the storage industry 

acquisition 

hitachi global storage technologies holdings pte ltd “hgst” acquisition 

on march 8 2012 the “closing date” we through western digital ireland “wdi” our indirect whollyowned subsidiary completed the acquisition the “acquisition” of all the issued and outstanding paidup share capital of viviti technologies ltd known until shortly before the acquisition as hgst from hitachi ltd “hitachi” pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated march 7 2011 among us wdi hitachi and hgst the acquisition is intended over time and subject to compliance with the regulatory conditions discussed below under “maintenance of competitive requirement” to result in a more efficient and innovative customerfocused storage company we do not expect to achieve significant operating expense synergies while the regulatory conditions are in effect 

  

the aggregate purchase price of the acquisition amounted to approximately 47 billion the purchase price consideration originally included preliminary estimates of the working capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a final postclosing adjustment the cash portion of the purchase price decreased by a net 27 million as a result of 37 million we received during 2013 for a postclosing adjustment related to changes in the working capital of hgst partially offset by 10 million we paid during 2013 for a postclosing assumed pension adjustment the purchase price was finalized prior to march 8 2013 which was the final date of the 12 month measurement period following the date of the acquisition 

toshiba transactions 

in connection with the regulatory approval process of the acquisition we announced on may 15 2012 that we had closed a transaction with toshiba corporation “toshiba” to divest certain 35inch hard drive assets and to purchase toshiba storage device thailand company limited “tsdt” a wholly owned subsidiary of toshiba that manufactured hard drives prior to the thailand flooding the net impact of these two transactions was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements in august 2013 we received a 45 million insurance recovery related to facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of tsdt 

maintenance of competitive requirement 

in connection with the regulatory approval process of the acquisition we agreed to certain conditions required by the ministry of commerce of the people’s republic of china “mofcom” including adopting measures to maintain hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agrees otherwise with the minimum period being two years from the closing date we worked closely with mofcom to finalize an operations plan that outlines in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement 

pending acquisition of stec 

on june 24 2013 we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which stec will be acquired by hgst the aggregate purchase price is estimated to be approximately 340 million in cash this represents approximately 207 million in enterprise value net of stec’s cash as of march 31 2013 the pending acquisition when completed will augment hgst’s existing solidstate storage capabilities accelerating its ability to expand its participation in the rapidly growing area of enterprise ssds the pending acquisition which is subject to closing customary conditions is expected to be completed in the third or fourth calendar quarter of 2013 

results of operations 

fiscal 2013 overview 

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” operating results for hgst which was acquired on march 8 2012 are included in our operating results only after the date of its acquisition 

in 2013 our net revenue increased by 23 to 154 billion on hard drive shipments of 242 million units as compared to 125 billion and 202 million units in 2012 in 2013 50 of our net revenue was derived from nonpc personal computer markets which include enterprise applications branded products and ce products as compared to 19 in 2012 hard drive average selling price “asp” decreased to 61 in 2013 from 62 in 2012 gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 284 in 2013 from 292 in 2012 operating income decreased from 18 billion in 2012 to 13 billion in 2013 which included a 681 million charge related to an arbitration award as well as 138 million of employee termination benefits and other charges as a percentage of net revenue operating income was 82 in 2013 compared to 142 in 2012 net income in 2013 was 10 billion or 398 per diluted share compared to 16 billion or 658 per diluted share in 2012 

for the september quarter we expect overall hard drive industry shipments to increase modestly to approximately 135 million to 140 million units from the june quarter’s 133 million units primarily due to a seasonal increase in consumer electronics and branded product shipments we expect our revenue in the september quarter to remain flat or increase slightly from the june quarter reflecting modest price declines and a seasonal change in business mix 

  

summary comparison of 2013 2012 and 2011 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue in millions except percentages 

 

 the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding unit shipments asps and revenues by geography and channel in millions except percentages and asps 

 

  

 fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 

net revenue net revenue was 154 billion for 2013 an increase of 23 from 2012 total hard drive shipments in 2013 increased to 242 million units as compared to 202 million units for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from the contribution of a full year of hgst operations partially offset by continued soft industry demand as well as a 1 decrease in asp from 62 to 61 

changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics in addition as a result of our acquisition of hgst our revenue by channel mix has become more heavily weighted toward oem 

consistent with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2013 these programs represented 8 of gross revenues compared to 6 in 2012 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

  

gross profit gross profit for 2013 was 44 billion an increase of 725 million or 20 from the prior year gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 284 in 2013 from 292 in 2012 this percentage decrease was primarily due to a decrease in asp as well as 101 million of incremental amortization reflecting a full year of amortization for intangibles related to the acquisition 

operating expenses total research and development “rd” expense and selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased to 148 of net revenue in 2013 compared to 126 in 2012 rd expense was 16 billion in 2013 an increase of 517 million or 49 over the prior year this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of hgst’s rd expense for the full year period as well as continued investment in product development to support new programs as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 102 in 2013 compared to 85 in 2012 sga expense was 706 million in 2013 an increase of 188 million or 36 as compared to 2012 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of hgst’s sga expense and amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition partially offset by the inclusion of acquisitionrelated expenses in the prioryear period sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 46 in 2013 compared to 42 in 2012 

during 2013 we recorded a 681 million charge related to an arbitration award for claims brought against us and a now former employee by seagate technology llc “seagate” alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets for further detail see “arbitration award” section below 

during 2013 we recorded 138 million of employee termination benefits and other charges these charges consisted of 109 million of employee termination benefits 14 million of asset impairment charges and 15 million of other charges during 2012 we recorded 56 million of asset impairment charges 16 million of contract termination and other exit costs and 8 million of employee termination benefits in addition during 2012 we recorded 214 million of net charges related to the flooding in thailand including 119 million of fixed asset impairments 61 million of recovery charges 28 million of writedowns of damaged inventory and 27 million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities offset by 21 million of insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements 

other income expense other expense net was 44 million in 2013 compared to 14 million in 2012 interest expense increased from 26 million in 2012 to 55 million in 2013 primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance since the acquisition interest income decreased slightly from 12 million in 2012 to 11 million in 2013 primarily due to a lower average daily invested cash balance for the period 

income tax provision income tax expense was 242 million in 2013 as compared to 145 million in 2012 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 198 in 2013 compared to 83 in 2012 our income tax provision for 2013 also reflects a tax benefit of 37 million as a result of the retroactive extension of the us federal research and experimentation tax credit “rd credit” that was signed into law on january 2 2013 as part of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the rd credit which had previously expired on december 31 2011 was extended through december 31 2013 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from 2014 through 2025 the current year generation of income tax credits and the effect of california proposition 39 

on november 6 2012 california voters approved california proposition 39 which affects california state income tax apportionment for most multistate taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2013 this proposition reduces our future income apportioned to california making it less likely for us to realize certain california deferred tax assets as a result we recorded an 88 million charge in 2013 to reduce our previously recognized california deferred tax assets as of december 28 2012 

as of june 28 2013 we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 240 million we recognized a net decrease of 40 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2013 interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

the internal revenue service “irs” had completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and issued revenue agent reports “rars” that proposed adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately 970 million primarily related to transfer pricing and intercompany payable balances we disagreed with the proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the irs appeals office in june 2013 we reached an agreement with the irs to resolve the transfer pricing issue this agreement resulted in a decrease in the amount of net operating loss and tax credits realized but did not have an impact to our consolidated statements of income the proposed adjustment relating to intercompany payable balances for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 will be addressed in conjunction with the irs’s examination of our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 which commenced in january 2012 in addition in january 2012 the irs commenced an examination of the 2007 fiscal period ended september 5 2007 of komag incorporated “komag” in february 2013 the irs commenced an examination of calendar years 2010 and 2011 of hgst which was acquired by us on march 8 2012 

  

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of june 28 2013 it is not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months any significant change in the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our uncertain tax positions 

arbitration award 

as disclosed below in part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on november 18 2011 a sole arbitrator ruled against us in an arbitration in minnesota the arbitration involves claims brought by seagate against us and a now former employee alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets the arbitrator issued an interim award against us in the amount of 525 million plus preaward interest on january 23 2012 the arbitrator issued a final award adding preaward interest in the amount of 1054 million for a total award of 6304 million on january 23 2012 we filed a petition in the district court of hennepin county minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated and a hearing on the petition to vacate was held on march 1 2012 on october 12 2012 the district court of hennepin county minnesota vacated in full the 6304 million final arbitration award and ordered that a rehearing be held concerning certain trade secret claims before a new arbitrator on october 30 2012 seagate initiated an appeal of the district court’s decision with the minnesota court of appeals oral arguments in the appeal were held on april 24 2013 on july 22 2013 the minnesota court of appeals reversed the district court’s decision and remanded for entry of an order and judgment confirming the arbitration award we strongly disagree with the decision of the court of appeals believe that the district court’s decision was correct and will file a petition for review with the minnesota supreme court if the minnesota supreme court elects not to hear our petition for review or affirms the court of appeals decision the district court is expected to enter an order and judgment confirming the 6304 million final arbitration award plus postaward interest on the 525 million initial award at the statutory rate of 10 from january 24 2012 no judgment will be entered while we are petitioning the minnesota supreme court we will continue to vigorously defend this matter nevertheless in light of uncertainties including the fact that the review of the court of appeals decision by the minnesota supreme court is discretionary we recorded an accrual of 681 million for this matter in our financial statements for the three months ended june 28 2013 this amount is in addition to the 25 million previously accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the total amount accrued of 706 million represents the amount of the final arbitration award plus interest accrued on the initial arbitration award at the statutory rate of 10 from january 24 2012 through june 28 2013 

fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

net revenue net revenue was 125 billion for 2012 an increase of 31 from 2011 operations from hgst contributed 31 billion in net revenue total hard drive shipments in 2012 decreased to 202 million units as compared to 207 million units for the prior year the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from a 17 increase in asp from 45 to 62 partially offset by lower shipments these changes were as a result of the severe supply constraints across the hard drive industry brought about by the thailand floods 

changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics however during 2012 changes in revenue by geography and channel reflected our efforts to allocate products to our customers as a result of the flooding in thailand by balancing their immediate needs with their prevailing inventory positions in order to maximize the availability of hard drive products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon in addition as a result of our acquisition of hgst our revenue by channel mix has become more heavily weighted toward oem 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2012 these programs represented 6 of gross revenues compared to 11 in 2011 this decrease was mainly driven by the severe supply constraints brought about by the thailand floods these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

gross margin gross margin for 2012 was 36 billion an increase of 18 billion or 103 from the prior year gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 292 in 2012 from 188 in 2011 this percentage increase was primarily due to an increase in asp brought about by the impact of the thailand flooding offset by 91 million for costs recognized upon the sale of inventory that was writtenup to fair value and 48 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition 

operating expenses total rd expense and sga expense increased to 126 of net revenue in 2012 compared to 106 in 2011 rd expense was 11 billion in 2012 an increase of 352 million or 50 over the prior year this increase in rd expense was primarily due to increased expense related to the business of hgst and the continued investment in product development to support new programs as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 85 in 2012 compared to 74 in 2011 sga expense was 518 million in 2012 an increase of 211 million or 69 as compared to 2011 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to increased expense related to the business of hgst the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and growing markets 37 million of incremental expenses related to the acquisition of hgst and 15 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 42 in 2012 compared to 32 in 2011 

  

during 2012 we recorded 214 million of net charges related to the flooding in thailand including 119 million of fixed asset impairments 61 million of recovery charges 28 million of writedowns of damaged inventory and 27 million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities offset by 21 million of insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements 

in addition during the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded 56 million of asset impairment charges 16 million of contract termination and other exit costs and 8 million of employee termination benefits 

other income expense other expense net was 14 million in 2012 compared to 1 million in 2011 interest expense increased from 10 million in 2011 to 26 million in 2012 primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance and a 5 million increase in debt commitment fees incurred prior to the closing of the acquisition offset by 4 million of gains on sales of our investments interest income increased from 9 million in 2011 to 12 million in 2012 due to higher average daily invested cash balances 

income tax provision income tax expense was 145 million in 2012 as compared to 54 million in 2011 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 83 in 2012 compared to 69 for 2011 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates through 2025 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

as of june 29 2012 we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 280 million which includes 39 million assumed in the acquisition aside from the increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to liabilities assumed in the acquisition we recognized a net decrease of 4 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2012 interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

the irs has completed its field examination of the federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for us and calendar years 2005 and 2006 for komag which was acquired by us on september 5 2007 in september 2011 we received a final rar and closing agreement with respect to the years under examination for komag this agreement resulted in an immaterial benefit to our income tax provision we have also received rars from the irs that seek adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately 970 million in connection with unresolved issues related primarily to transfer pricing and intercompany payable balances we disagree with the proposed adjustments and in may 2011 we filed a protest with the irs appeals office in january 2012 the irs commenced an examination of our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and komag’s period ended september 5 2007 

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of june 29 2012 it was not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months any significant change in the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns 

liquidity and capital resources 

we ended 2013 with total cash and cash equivalents of 43 billion an increase of 11 billion from june 29 2012 the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended june 28 2013 in millions 

 

   

our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds in connection with our acquisition we entered into a fiveyear credit agreement the “credit facility” which provides for a 500 million revolving credit facility in addition we may elect to expand the credit facility by up to an additional 500 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations as well as our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt dividend stock repurchase and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

a total of 28 billion and 17 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the united states at june 28 2013 and june 29 2012 respectively substantially all of the amounts held outside of the united states are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations if we are required to pay the arbitration award described in the section “arbitration award” above the award would be paid from one of our foreign subsidiaries using cash and cash equivalents held outside of the united states on september 13 2012 our board of directors approved a capital allocation plan which includes repurchases of our common stock and the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations or capital allocation plan in the event funds from foreign operations are needed in the united states any repatriation could result in the accrual and payment of additional us income tax 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 31 billion in both 2013 and 2012 as compared to 17 billion in 2011 cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash provided by working capital changes was 715 million for 2013 as compared to 324 million for 2012 and 238 million for 2011 

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the average quarterly cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2013 were as follows 

 

 for 2013 our average days sales outstanding “dsos” decreased by 6 days days in inventory “dios” increased by 2 days and days payables outstanding “dpos” decreased by 17 days changes in average dsos and dios are generally related to linearity of shipments and the timing of inventory builds respectively changes in dpos are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period in the prioryear period the higher dsos dios and dpos were primarily due to the impact of including hgst’s accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable balances as of june 29 2012 but only including hgst’s revenue and cost of sales from the date of acquisition from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for 2013 was 970 million as compared to 42 billion for 2012 and 793 million for 2011 during 2013 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 952 million of capital expenditures and 17 million related to the purchase of investments capital expenditures in 2013 primarily consisted of flood recovery and increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio during 2012 cash used in investing activities consisted of 35 billion net of cash acquired used for the acquisitions 76 million of proceeds related to the sale of equipment and capital expenditures of 717 million during 2011 cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of 778 million and 15 million for equipment related to the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility 

our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market funds that are invested in us treasury securities us treasury bills and us government agency securities we also have 14 million of auctionrate securities which are classified as availableforsale securities in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 10 billion for 2013 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 819 million for 2012 and net cash used in financing activities of 106 million for 2011 net cash used in financing activities for 2013 consisted of 842 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock 181 million used to pay dividends on our common stock and 230 million used to repay longterm debt offset by a net 205 million provided by employee stock plans net cash provided by financing activities for 2012 consisted of the 28 billion of proceeds borrowed under the credit facility in connection with the acquisition net of issuance costs and a net 141 million provided by employee stock plans offset by 604 million used to repurchase stock and 15 billion used to repay our outstanding debt as well as debt assumed in the acquisition net cash used in financing activities for 2011 consisted of 106 million used to repay longterm debt and 50 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock offset by a net 50 million related to employee stock plans 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than facility lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions see “contractual obligations and commitments” below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have an interest in or relationships with any specialpurpose entities 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following is a summary of our known contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of june 28 2013 in millions 

 

  

 longterm debt 

on march 8 2012 in connection with the acquisition wdi and wdt collectively the “borrowers” entered into the credit facility that provides for 28 billion of unsecured loan facilities consisting of a 23 billion term loan facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility in addition the borrowers may elect to expand the credit facility by up to an additional 500 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments as of june 28 2013 the outstanding balance of the term loan facility was 20 billion we are required to make principal payments on the term loan facility totaling 230 million a year for fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016 and the remaining 13 billion balance subject to adjustment to reflect prepayments or an increase to its term loan facility due and payable in full in fiscal 2017 on march 8 2017 as of june 28 2013 500 million was available for future borrowings on the revolving credit facility see part ii item 8 note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

the credit facility requires us to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated basis for us and our subsidiaries in addition the credit facility contains customary covenants including covenants that limit or restrict subject to certain exceptions our ability to incur liens incur indebtedness make certain restricted payments merge consolidate or dispose of substantially all of our assets enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements and make any material change in the nature of our business upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility the administrative agent at the request or with the consent of the required lenders as defined in the credit facility may cease making loans terminate the credit facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable require the cash collateralization of letters of credit andor exercise all other rights and remedies available to it the lenders and the letter of credit issuer the credit facility specifies a number of events of default some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods including among other things nonpayment defaults covenant defaults crossdefaults to other material indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency defaults material judgment defaults and a change of control default as of june 28 2013 we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 

  

purchase orders 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers containing minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to commitments 

foreign exchange contracts 

we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

unrecognized tax benefits 

as of june 28 2013 the cash portion of our total recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 208 million we estimate the timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within the next one to eight years see part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our total tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

  

stock repurchase program 

on may 21 2012 we announced that our board of directors authorized 15 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through may 18 2017 on september 13 2012 we announced that the board of directors authorized an additional 15 billion for the repurchase of our common stock and the extension of our stock repurchase program until september 13 2017 we repurchased 190 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 842 million in 2013 the remaining amount available to be purchased under our stock repurchase program as of june 28 2013 was 20 billion subsequent to june 28 2013 and through august 16 2013 we repurchased an additional 23 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 150 million we may continue to repurchase our common stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a rule 10b51 plan we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows 

cash dividend policy 

on september 13 2012 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy under the cash dividend policy holders of our common stock receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors in 2013 we declared aggregate cash dividends of 100 per share of our common stock totaling 240 million of which 181 million was paid during 2013 we may modify suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time see part ii item 5 included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue and accounts receivable 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information and customer claim processing if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differs from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product generally total sales incentive and marketing programs range from 7 to 11 of gross revenues per quarter for 2013 sales incentive and marketing programs were 8 of gross revenues changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 05 of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2011 customer sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could materially affect operating results 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

  

warranty 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated replacement costs estimated repair costs which include scrap costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross profit and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value we use the firstin firstout “fifo” method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories while we use the weightedaverage method to value precious metal inventories weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production the weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a fifo method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

  

stockbased compensation 

we account for all stockbased compensation at fair value stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options and cashsettled stock appreciation rights “sars” granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan purchase rights are estimated using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model we account for sars as liability awards based upon our intention to settle such awards in cash the sars liability is recognized for that portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date the sharebased liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

goodwill and other longlived assets 

the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date with amounts exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired during 2013 we changed the date of our annual impairment test from the last day of may to the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter we believe changing the test date to the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter is preferable as it allows us additional time to complete the impairment test 

we first use qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is more likely than not impaired if we conclude from the qualitative assessment that goodwill is more likely than not impaired we follow a twostep approach to quantify the impairment 

we are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit in addition the estimates used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit may change based on results of operations macroeconomic conditions or other factors changes in these estimates could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired in business combinations and inprocess research and development inprocess research and development is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired acquired intangibles are amortized on a straightline basis over their respective estimated useful lives longlived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable if impairment is indicated the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes currently we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the british pound sterling euro japanese yen malaysian ringgit philippine peso singapore dollar and thai baht see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

as of june 28 2013 we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

 

  

 in 2013 2012 and 2011 total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

disclosure about other market risks 

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of the applicable borrower either a a libor rate determined by reference to the british bankers association libor rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing subject to certain exceptions the “eurodollar rate” or b a base rate determined by reference to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 ii the prime rate as announced by bank of america na and iii the eurodollar rate plus 100 the “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 150 to 250 with respect to borrowings at the eurodollar rate and 050 to 150 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis if the federal funds rate prime rate or libor rate increase our interest payments could also increase a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan facility would increase interest expense by approximately 20 million annually

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see page 51 herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 28 2013 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

business strategy 

our focused business strategy is to be an industryleading developer and manufacturer of storage products that enable people to create manage experience and preserve digital content we strive to achieve our business strategy through these elements 

 

  

 we believe our strategy provides these benefits 

 

  

  

  

 industry 

storage continues to be critical to the large amounts of digital content being created we believe that the volume of petabytes stored will grow approximately 33 annually from calendar 2011 to calendar 2016 

the pc market including notebook and desktop pcs comprises the client market the highest volume market for our products in calendar 2011 the pc market represented 73 of our unit shipments 

increasingly data storage needs are being driven by mobile and cloudbased applications such as video photography and audio on tablets smart phones and other handheld devices the growth in the number of computing users in the world is unabated creating more usage and more digital content to be stored cloud computing applications are especially noteworthy given that they create multiple copies of photos videos and other content to ensure efficient distribution and security 

  

we believe unit volumes in the hard drive industry were down 5 in calendar year 2011 from calendar 2010 as historic flooding in thailand shuttered approximately 45 of the industry’s assembly capacity and a majority of its supply chain between midoctober 2011 and february 2012 each industry market was negatively affected by the flooding with branded products suffering the greatest setbacks 

enterprise 

we believe shipments into the enterprise market of the storage industry increased 17 in calendar 2011 from calendar 2010 enterprise storage devices consist of performance and capacity hard drives as well as performance solidstate drives all of these devices are used in multiple types of enterprise datacenters that provide storage for a range of cloud and corporate applications within datacenters these drives are typically used in workstations computer servers and storage systems 

performance applications are essential to the operations of an enterprise and require the greatest capabilities and reliability in hard drives and solidstate drives this class of drives is the most highly engineered product line in the storage industry cloud computing is the trend towards centralization of information storage and delivery of internetbased services cloud computing delivers shared resources software and information to users on demand on a multitude of devices such as client pcs tablets and smart phones most cloud computing models consist of services delivered through large data centers with enterpriseclass servers the infrastructure to support cloud computing storage needs is driving the demand for enterprise capacity hard drives and solidstate drives 

the enterprise market also consists of solidstate drives for use in embedded applications such as network communications and industrial medical military and aerospace applications all of which require high durability and long life cycles 

we believe that industry unit shipments of performance and capacity hard drives represented 53 and 44 respectively of enterprise hard drives shipped in calendar 2011 increasingly solid state drives are also being deployed in the performance drives of the enterprise market representing 3 of the enterprise units shipped in calendar 2011 

client desktop and notebook pcs 

client storage devices consist of internal hard drives and solidstate drives for desktop and mobile pcs we believe industry unit shipments of mobile hard drives into the client space declined 3 in calendar 2011 from calendar 2010 while volumes of desktop hard drives declined 13 in calendar 2011 from calendar 2010 

desktop pcs are intended for regular use at single locations in homes and businesses as well as in multiuser educational and government networks mobile pcs primarily notebook computers are used both in and away from homes and businesses we believe that the demand for client computer hard drives and solidstate drives will grow primarily due to increasing demand in emerging countries continued corporate refreshes the proliferation of digital content and changing requirements for increasing performance small size and low power consumption 

mobile hard drives for notebook pcs the industry’s highest volume market have traditionally been in a 25inch form factor with a 95mm height there is a trend toward thinner lighter devices with extended battery life and low power consumption to support this trend the storage industry is developing smaller form factors such as slimmer 25inch hard drives and hybrid drives a hybrid drive is a form of a hard drive that incorporates nand flash technology in the caching function hybrid drives specifically designed for mobile computing will combine the power and performance of solid state drives with the capacity affordability and availability attributes of hard drives 

consumer electronics 

hard drives for ce products are primarily used in digital video recorders “dvrs” game consoles and security video recording systems we believe hard drive unit shipments into the ce market decreased 5 in calendar 2011 from calendar 2010 

  

dvrs offer greater consumer viewing flexibility and enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program game consoles enable users to save games movies music pictures and other user generated content we believe growth in the ce market will continue to create demand for higher capacity hard drives 

branded products 

external storage devices supplement the storage space of pc systems for home and small office networks they are ideally suited to back up data on internal drives because of their portability and security features we believe hard drive shipments into the branded products market increased 5 in calendar 2011 from calendar 2010 

media players connect to a user’s television or home theater system and play digital movies music and photos from an integrated hard drive universal serial bus “usb” mass storage devices or content services accessed over the internet there is a growing need for consumers to play and view their personal stored digital content and premium content from the internet on their television and home theater system consistent with the growing trend to digitize rich content and data 

home networking is an emerging market in the branded products space as consumers seek to address overload problems resulting from the proliferation of devices simultaneously using home networks 

other market opportunities 

we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve based on our significant investments we believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market penetration and be a fullline data storage solutions supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the recent past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions 

products 

we offer a broad line of storage devices our hard drives currently include 35inch and 25inch form factors capacities ranging from 30 gigabytes “gb” to 4 terabytes “tb” nominal rotation speeds up to 15000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and interfaces such as advanced technology attachment “ata” and serial attached scsi small computer system interface “sas” in addition we offer a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives utilizing our wd greenpower technology tm  our solidstate drives currently include 25inch msata mo297 and compactflash form factors capacities ranging from 128 mb to 400 gb and interfaces such as sas serial advanced technology attachment “sata” and parallel advanced technology attachment “pata” we also participate in the mobile computing market of smart phones and tablets with standalone western digital software applications such as wd photos and wd2go for ios android and windows phone platforms

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses totaled 11 billion 703 million and 611 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively for a discussion of risks related to our development of new products see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

technology and product development 

hard drives 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 industrystandard interfaces allow the drives to communicate with the host system the primary interface for pcs is sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are sas fibre channel arbitrated loop and sata 

the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” 

the hda includes heads magnetic media head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner and a pivotarm module on which the individual heads including suspension are mounted each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a power device that controls the motor and hsa positioner and a system on chip comprised of a drive interface controller and recording channel the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

the storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density track density multiplied by bit density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area head and magnetic media technologies are two of the key components affecting areal density as areal density increases achieving a given drive capacity potentially reduces product costs over time through reduced component requirements we are vertically integrated in these two most important technology components of hard drives heads and magnetic media we also invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

solidstate drives 

solidstate drives use semiconductor nonvolatile media rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads to store and allow fast access to data without any moving parts the capacity of a solidstate drive is based on the total number of megabytes or gb of semiconductor media in the solidstate drive 

our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of risks related to technological innovations see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

  

sales and distribution 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of united states “us” companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 81 83 and 81 of our net revenue for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively sales to international customers are subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international customers see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and providing information and support through our web site in accordance with standard storage industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs 

original equipment manufacturers oems including largescale datacenter operators  purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that allow for “buildtoorder” in which they do not build until there is a firm order for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our strong relationships with the leading oems 

distributors we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for us and our products we also sell our branded products through our web site 

for 2012 sales to hewlett packard company accounted for 11 of our net revenue for 2011 and 2010 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for a discussion of risks related to our customers refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customer information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

we compete with manufacturers of hard drives for client compute client noncompute and enterprise applications as well as manufacturers of solidstate drives competition in the hard drive market consists of five brands hgst samsung seagate toshiba and wd in solidstate products we compete with a wide range of manufacturers from small startup companies to multinational corporations including micron technology inc samsung electronics co ltd seagate technology llc stec inc and toshiba corporation 

  

the storage industry is intensely competitive with hard drive and solidstate suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards and we believe there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market and we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors semiconductor media competes with hard drives along a range of product attributes in particular semiconductor media currently offers attractive functionality in consumer handheld applications requiring smaller form factors lower power and less storage capacity such as smart phones and tablets semiconductor media offers greater performance than hard drives in some storage applications advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could also result in competitive products for storing digital content with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis 

we differentiate ourselves by focusing on operational excellence high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating desirable product performance attributes into our storage devices we also differentiate ourselves by emphasizing nonproduct related attributes such as availability and rapid response to our customers which requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support we believe that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation its execution track record and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a storage device particularly in a rapidly changing technology environment 

seasonality 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year this seasonality is a result of consumer spending at the beginning of the school year and during the holiday season seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of risks related to seasonality in our business see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

service and warranty 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned products for our customers for a further discussion of our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

manufacturing 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and be able to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume and utilization low cost assembly and testing and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestofclass technology and manufacturing quality 

hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the production and assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs for our nonhard drive products we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of risks related to manufacturing see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

  

materials and supplies 

we use a number of components equipment goods and services in the manufacturing of our products the key components of our hard drives are magnetic heads magnetic media suspensions with related head gimbal assemblies “hgas” and hsas spindle motors custom and standard electronics such as systemonchip magnetic media motor controllers preamps and printed circuit boards base and top covers and magnets and related voice coil motors 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for our hard drives we acquire all of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers the major components used in the manufacture of our solidstate drives the semiconductor media and systemonchip and in our media players the controller are also acquired from third party suppliers we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of risks related to our component supplies see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

backlog 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

we own numerous patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the us 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell our products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the storage industry for discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations and relating to the protection of the environment including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution these permits are subject to modification renewal and revocation by issuing authorities we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations 

  

we have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws regulations and permits we budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws 

our properties have in some cases been operated for many years and may contain soil or groundwater contamination in certain of our facilities we are undertaking voluntary monitoring of soil and groundwater based on available information including our voluntary monitoring activities we do not believe that we have a current affirmative legal obligation for any remedial action

as of june 29 2012 we employed a total of 103111 employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors 

while the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement a majority of our employees in japan are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the hitachi worker union in addition each of our three manufacturing subsidiaries in china has its own labor union of which many of each subsidiary’s direct employees are members however none of our chinese subsidiaries is currently subject to collective bargaining agreements with these labor unions while we have had minor disputes with employees in china in the past we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of risks related to our skilled employees see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors tableend the 2011 severe flooding in thailand which inundated our thailand manufacturing facilities and resulted in the temporary suspension of all production in those facilities has affected and will continue to affect our nearterm business results of operations and financial condition 

as previously disclosed the 2011 severe flooding in thailand resulted in the temporary suspension of production in all of our thailand manufacturing facilities while production has resumed in our thailand facilities material risks and uncertainties as a result of flooding remain including the following 

 

   

  

  

  

 in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our acquisition of hgst we agreed to divest certain assets to toshiba and the completion of the divestiture is subject to risks and uncertainties and our business will be adversely affected in the event we fail to successfully execute the divestiture on a timely basis or at all 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete our acquisition of hgst we agreed subject to review by regulatory agencies in certain jurisdictions to divest certain assets to toshiba that will expand toshiba’s capacity to manufacture 35inch hard drives for the desktop consumer electronics and nearline business critical applications while this divestiture transaction closed in may 2012 certain steps remain before we will have successfully completed the transfer of the divested assets to toshiba as provided in the purchase agreement there is no guarantee that we will complete the divestiture to toshiba on a timely basis or at all if we are not able to complete the divestiture on a timely basis or at all the jurisdictions that conditioned their approval of the hgst acquisition on the divestiture could impose certain obligations on us including a requirement that we divest the assets subject to the toshiba divestiture or other assets to another purchaser which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hgst on a timely basis or at all our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with obtaining the regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition of hgst we agreed to certain conditions required by the chinese ministry of commerce “mofcom” including adopting measures to keep hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agrees otherwise with the minimum period being two years we are working closely with mofcom to finalize an operations plan that is expected to outline in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement compliance with these measures limits our ability to integrate hgst’s business with our business and we do not expect to achieve significant operating expense synergies while the conditions remain in place cause delays or uncertainties in making decisions about the combined business and result in significant costs including additional capital expenditures relative to our competitors as a result of maintaining separate research and development functions or require changes in business practices each of which could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations in the event we fail to comply with these measures the time during which we are required to comply with the condition could be extended and we could be subject to other conditions or penalties that could adversely affect the business 

  

in addition to the requirement to maintain hgst as an independent competitor we may also fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of hgst on a timely basis or at all for a variety of other reasons including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are not able to successfully manage these issues the anticipated benefits and efficiencies of the hgst acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and our ability to compete our revenue and gross margins and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

the acquisition of hgst may result in significant restructuring charges that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company 

the financial results of the combined company may be adversely affected by cash expenses and noncash accounting charges incurred in connection with the combination the amount and timing of these possible charges are not yet known the price of our common stock following the acquisition could decline to the extent the combined company’s financial results are materially affected by these charges 

the financing of the hgst acquisition may have an adverse impact on our liquidity limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our acquisition of hgst was financed by a combination of the issuance of additional shares of our common stock the use of a significant amount of our cash on hand and the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness the use of cash on hand and indebtedness to finance the acquisition reduced our liquidity and could cause us to place more reliance on cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and development activities the credit agreement we entered into with respect to the indebtedness we incurred to finance the acquisition contains restrictive covenants including financial covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control the indebtedness and these restrictive covenants will also have the effect among other things of impairing our ability to obtain additional financing if needed limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions in addition a breach of the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement which if not cured or waived could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

  

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these global economic and credit market conditions include the following 

 

  

  

  

 we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to the risk of declining average selling prices “asps” volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

demand for our hard drives depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition if more intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could adversely impact revenue and gross margins our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors along with others may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants 

  

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions a recent shift from air to ocean freight in response to increased transportation costs which requires additional lead times and industry consolidation which has resulted in less availability of historical market data for certain product segments in addition because hard drives are designed to be largely interchangeable with competitors’ products our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

we experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for hard drives in the desktop mobile ce and retail markets seasonality historically has been partially attributable to the increase in sales of pcs and ce devices during the backtoschool and winter holiday seasons in the enterprise market our sales are typically seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially as a result of the thailand flooding and the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

our customers’ demand for storage may not continue to grow at current industry estimates which may lower the prices our customers are willing to pay for our products or put us at a disadvantage to competing technologies 

our customers’ demand for storage may not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result of 

 

  

 demand for our products also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management the emergence of processes such as data deduplication and storage virtualization economic conditions and the rate of increase in areal density exceeding the increase in our customers’ demand for storage these factors could lead to our customers’ storage needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products that we do not offer thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand for storage our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels including the etail channel adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd ®  or hgst™brand products our operating results may be adversely affected 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken our operating results could suffer 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

during the year ended june 29 2012 50 of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

our entry into additional markets increases the complexity of our business and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes as required by these new markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

as we expand our product line to sell into additional markets the overall complexity of our business increases at an accelerated rate and we become subject to different market dynamics the new markets into which we are expanding or may expand may have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently exist these different characteristics may include among other things demand volume requirements demand seasonality product generation development rates customer concentrations warranty and product return policies and performance and compatibility requirements our failure to make the necessary adaptations to our business model to address these different characteristics complexities and new market dynamics could adversely affect our operating results 

  

expansion into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we do not successfully expand into new markets our business may suffer 

to remain a significant supplier of hard drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch or 25inch hard drives for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets however demand for hard drives may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer but which we do not expansion into other hard drive markets and resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may require us to make substantial additional investments in part because our operations are largely vertically integrated now that we manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture if we fail to successfully expand into new hard drive markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products 

our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality and creates additional capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks to our business 

under our business plan we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

in addition as a result of our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

we make significant investments in research and development to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

over the past several years our business strategy has been to derive a competitive advantage by moving from being a follower of new technologies to being a leader in the innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in research and development and in attempting to remain competitive we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model there can be no assurance that these investments will result in viable technologies or products or if these investments do result in viable technologies or products that they will be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is also critical to the success of our business we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage 

  

further industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

the storage industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years including the acquisition of the hard disk drive business of samsung electronics co ltd by seagate technology plc in december 2011 consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside of hard drives may over extended periods of time sell hard drives at prices that we cannot profitably match 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside of hard drives because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to achieve profitability they may sell hard drives at lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonhard drive products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their hard drives at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers or if product life cycles lengthen it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our hard drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition a product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or customer relationships and may cause us to lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays lost revenue or increased costs 

our future operating results may depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines as such the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts from reliable component suppliers to do so we must maintain effective relationships with our supply base to source our component needs develop compatible technology and maintain continuity of supply at reasonable costs if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our supply base or if we fail to integrate components from our suppliers effectively this may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver the best products to our customers and our profitability could suffer 

  

certain equipment and consumables we use in our manufacturing or testing processes are available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment and consumables use materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

each of the following could also significantly harm our operating results 

 

  

  

  

  

 shortages of commodity materials or commodity components price volatility or use by other industries of materials and components used in the storage industry may negatively impact our operating results 

increases in the cost for certain commodity materials or commodity components may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives and key components shortages of commodity components such as dram and nand flash or commodity materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium which are critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals andor increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other commodity components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results the volatility in the cost of oil also affects our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of uncertain global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

  

failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components technology or production equipment for our products may adversely affect our operations 

we rely on suppliers for various component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves such as semiconductors motors flex circuits and suspensions likewise we rely on suppliers for certain technology and equipment necessary for advanced development technology for future products some of these components and most of this technology and production equipment must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of with whom we are sole sourced we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated with our products and technology and production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently the failure of these suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components that can be integrated into our products or technology and production equipment that can be used to develop or manufacture next generation products may cause us to experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment of hard drive products our expansion into new technology and markets or our ability to remain competitive with alternative storage technologies therefore adversely affecting our business and financial results 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our costs and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some revolutionary technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic recording energy assisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads magnetic media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however increasing areal density has become more difficult in the storage industry if we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to include more components in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gigabytes per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

  

if we do not properly manage technology transitions and new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement these new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with our product development 

if we fail to develop and introduce new hard drives that are competitive against alternative storage technologies our business may suffer 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with competing technologies alternative storage technologies like solidstate storage technology have successfully served digital entertainment markets for products such as digital cameras mp3 players usb flash drives mobile phones and tablet devices that cannot be economically serviced using hard drive technology advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in solidstate storage emerging as a technology that is competitive with hard drives for high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers and storage there can be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and developing new products for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets in response to solidstate storage as well as other competing technologies if our hard drive technology fails to offer higher capacity performance and reliability with lower costpergigabyte than solidstate storage for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology to serve these markets and our business will suffer 

our manufacturing operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities which subjects us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our manufacturing operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities in california and in asia the manufacturing facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations in asia and elsewhere a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’ other suppliers such as the spread of a pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture andor sell which would result in substantial harm to our operating results similarly a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities including access to or from these facilities by employees or logistics operations would significantly affect our ability to manufacture andor sell hard drives which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results for example prior to the 2011 flooding in thailand all of our internal slider capacity and 60 of our hard drive manufacturing capacity was in thailand as a result of the flooding in thailand our facilities were inundated and temporarily shut down during that period our ability to manufacture hard drives was significantly constrained which adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations while we have taken certain steps to diversify our manufacturing footprint a significant event that impacts any of our manufacturing sites or the sites of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture hard drives and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

  

manufacturing and marketing our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing efforts including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or freight lanes such as due to labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures or attacks which could harm our business 

we are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure among other functions to operate our factories sell our products fulfill orders manage inventory and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures cyberattacks such as computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events our business is also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences loss or theft of our our customers’ or our business partners’ intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information damage to our reputation interruptions in our business and remediation costs each of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions it may adversely affect our future results 

as part of our growth strategy we may pursue acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transaction some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all if we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our future results of operations could be adversely affected please see the risk factors above for specific risks and uncertainties regarding our acquisition of hgst 

  

if we are unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our business results may suffer 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as well as attract integrate and retain new skilled employees volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted by global economic conditions we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff our operating results would likely be harmed 

the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on november 18 2011 a sole arbitrator ruled against us in an arbitration in minnesota the arbitration involves claims brought by seagate technology llc against us and a now former employee alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets the arbitrator issued an interim award against us in the amount of 525 million plus preaward interest on january 23 2012 the arbitrator issued a final award adding preaward interest in the amount of 1054 million for a total award of 6304 million on january 23 2012 we filed a petition in the district court of hennepin county minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated and a hearing on the petition was held on march 1 2012 interest as simple interest not compounding on the final award 6304 million also accrues at the minnesota statutory rate of 10 per year while we pursue our motion to vacate the award and if necessary an appeal if the motion to vacate the award is unsuccessful we intend to pursue vigorously our motion to vacate the award and if necessary to appeal the award if it is confirmed by the district court of hennepin county minnesota we do not believe it is probable that the arbitrator’s award will be sustained and accordingly have not recorded any liability for the arbitrator’s award in excess of the amount we have previously accrued 25 million we cannot make any assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to vacate the award or to overturn the award on appeal if we are unsuccessful in these efforts payment of the award including interest would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we will also be required to record a liability for the award if we should determine it is probable we will be required to pay the award 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results 

  

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade and tax regulations and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs 

we may be or become subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our component suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs for example the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation in the united states is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers could harm our business 

we expect our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or divergence of a supplier’s business practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states could harm our business by 

 

  

  

  

  

   

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from nonus based vendors if the us dollar continues to weaken against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin if this occurs it would have a negative impact on our operating results 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the united states fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the united states 

we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks our acquisition of hgst has also resulted in an increase to our customer credit risk given that we service many of the same customers any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the market price of our common stock is volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

  

current economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from financial institution failures 

the uncertain global economic conditions and volatile investment markets have caused us to hold more cash and cash equivalents than we would hold under normal circumstances since there has been an overall increase in demand for lowrisk us governmentbacked securities with a limited supply in the financial marketplace we face increased difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and other financial institutions a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could have an adverse impact on our financial position 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 29 2012 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective as a result of our acquisition of hgst on march 8 2012 our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of acquisition includes certain existing controls adopted from hgst if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting in future periods investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received revenue agent reports seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of the notice of proposed adjustment and the audits are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations net income or cash flows

acquisition 

hitachi global storage technologies holdings pte ltd “hgst” acquisition 

on march 8 2012 the “closing date” we through western digital ireland “wdi” our indirect whollyowned subsidiary completed the acquisition the “acquisition” of all the issued and outstanding paidup share capital of viviti technologies ltd until recently known as hgst from hitachi pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated march 7 2011 among us wdi hitachi and hgst the “spa” the acquisition is intended over time and subject to compliance with applicable regulatory conditions imposed on the acquisition to result in a more efficient and innovative customerfocused storage company with significant operating scale strong global talent and a broad product lineup backed by a rich technology portfolio we do not expect to achieve significant operating expense synergies while the regulatory conditions remain in effect 

the preliminary aggregate purchase price of the acquisition amounted to approximately 47 billion which was paid on the closing date and funded with existing cash new debt and 25 million newly issued shares of our common stock the cash portion of the purchase price is subject to a postclosing adjustment an increase or a decrease that has not been determined for changes in the working capital of hgst and certain other payments and expenses 

following the issuance of the 25 million shares of our common stock to hitachi in accordance with the spa hitachi owns approximately ten percent of our outstanding shares of common stock the shares issued to hitachi are subject to a restriction that limits their trade or transfer for one year from the closing date pursuant to the terms of a separate investor rights agreement we entered into with hitachi in connection with the acquisition hitachi has the right to designate and has designated two individuals the “hitachi designees” to serve as directors on our board of directors this right will terminate i with respect to one of the hitachi designees at the end of the second full calendar year following the closing date ii in the event hitachi ceases to beneficially own at least 50 of the shares of our common stock it received in connection with the acquisition iii if hitachi has sold at least 10 of the shares of our common stock it received in connection with the acquisition in the event that hitachi ceases to beneficially own at least 5 of our outstanding common stock iv upon hitachi’s breach of certain standstill or transfer restriction obligations of the investor rights agreement or v upon hitachi’s material breach of a separate agreement not to compete that we entered into with hitachi on the closing date 

on the closing date western digital corporation wdi and western digital technologies inc “wdt” entered into a fiveyear credit agreement the “credit facility” with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and the lenders party thereto the credit facility provided for 28 billion of unsecured loan facilities consisting of a 23 billion term loan facility and a 500 million revolving credit facility the only borrower under the term loan facility is wdi and the revolving credit facility is available to both wdi and wdt the 23 billion term loans and 500 million revolving loans were used together with additional cash and the 25 million newly issued shares of our common stock to fund the acquisition see “liquidity and capital resources—contractual obligations and commitments” for a further description of the credit facility 

toshiba transactions 

in connection with the regulatory approval process of the acquisition we announced on may 15 2012 that we had closed a transaction with toshiba corporation “toshiba” to divest certain 35inch hard drive assets and to purchase toshiba storage device thailand company limited “tsdt” a whollyowned subsidiary of toshiba that manufactured hard drives prior to the recent thailand flooding the net impact of these two transactions was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 

  

maintenance of competitive requirement 

in addition in connection with the regulatory approval process of the acquisition we agreed to certain conditions required by the chinese ministry of commerce “mofcom” including adopting measures to maintain hgst as an independent competitor until mofcom agrees otherwise with the minimum period being two years we are working closely with mofcom to finalize an operations plan that is expected to outline in more detail the conditions of the competitive requirement 

thailand flooding 

we suspended production in all of our thailand manufacturing facilities during the week of october 10 2011 due to severe flooding in thailand where flood waters inundated our facilities and submerged certain equipment located there the flooded facilities in thailand included our magnetic head slider fabrication facilities which supplied a substantial majority of our magnetic head requirements prior to the flooding the flooded facilities in thailand also included our hard drive head gimbal assembly “hga” and head stack assembly “hsa” facilities 

in the march quarter of 2012 we restarted hard drive production and recommenced slider production in thailand we also extended slider production capacity into malaysia and began shipping hard drives with sliders produced in malaysia in the june quarter we believe we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand 

in 2012 we recorded 214 million of charges related to the flooding total charges included 119 million of fixed asset impairments 61 million of recovery charges 28 million of writedowns of damaged inventory and 27 million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities offset by 21 million of insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements we maintain insurance coverage that provides property and business interruption coverage in the event of losses arising from flooding we have submitted claims to our insurers and are awaiting a determination of how much of our total losses will be covered by insurance it is reasonably possible that the final losses that we incur in connection with the flood damage and our business interruption will exceed the limits of our insurance policies 

results of operations 

fiscal 2012 overview 

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” operating results for hgst and the magnetic media sputtering operations of hoya corporation and hoya magnetics singapore pte ltd together “hoya” which were acquired on march 8 2012 and june 30 2010 respectively are included in our operating results only after the dates of their acquisition 

in 2012 our net revenue increased by 31 to 125 billion on hard drive shipments of 202 million units as compared to 95 billion and 207 million units in 2011 operations from hgst contributed 31 billion in net revenue in 2012 19 of our hard drive revenue was derived from noncompute and enterprise markets which include ce products enterprise applications and branded products as compared to 27 in the prioryear period hard drive asp increased to 62 in 2012 from 45 in 2011 gross margin percentage increased to 292 in 2012 from 188 in 2011 operating income increased from 781 million in 2011 to 18 billion in 2012 which included a net 214 million of charges related to the flooding 80 million of impairments and other charges and 54 million of expenses related to the acquisition of hgst as a percentage of net revenue operating income was 142 in 2012 compared to 82 in 2011 net income in 2012 was 16 billion or 658 per diluted share compared to 726 million or 309 per diluted share in 2011 

for the september quarter we expect overall hard drive industry shipments to remain flat with the june quarter and pricing to reflect competitive market conditions as such we expect our revenue in the september quarter to decrease slightly from the june quarter for fiscal 2013 we expect overall hard drive industry shipments to increase 5 from fiscal 2012 

  

summary comparison of 2012 2011 and 2010 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue in millions except percentages 

 

  

 the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding unit shipments asps and revenues by geography and channel in millions except percentages and asps 

 

  

 fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

net revenue net revenue was 125 billion for 2012 an increase of 31 from 2011 operations from hgst contributed 31 billion in net revenue total hard drive shipments in 2012 decreased to 202 million units as compared to 207 million units for the prior year the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from a 17 increase in asp from 45 to 62 partially offset by lower shipments these changes were as a result of the severe supply constraints across the hard drive industry brought about by the thailand floods 

  

changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics however during 2012 changes in revenue by geography and channel reflected our efforts to allocate products to our customers as a result of the flooding in thailand by balancing their immediate needs with their prevailing inventory positions in order to maximize the availability of hard drive products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon in addition as a result of our acquisition of hgst our revenue by channel mix has become more heavily weighted toward oem 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2012 these programs represented 6 of gross revenues compared to 11 in 2011 this decrease was mainly driven by the severe supply constraints brought about by the thailand floods these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

gross margin gross margin for 2012 was 36 billion an increase of 18 billion or 103 from the prior year gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 292 in 2012 from 188 in 2011 this percentage increase was primarily due to an increase in asp brought about by the impact of the thailand flooding offset by 91 million for costs recognized upon the sale of inventory that was writtenup to fair value and 48 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition 

operating expenses total research and development “rd” expense and selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased to 126 of net revenue in 2012 compared to 106 in 2011 rd expense was 11 billion in 2012 an increase of 352 million or 50 over the prior year this increase in rd expense was primarily due to increased expense related to the business of hgst and the continued investment in product development to support new programs as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 85 in 2012 compared to 74 in 2011 sga expense was 518 million in 2012 an increase of 211 million or 69 as compared to 2011 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to increased expense related to the business of hgst the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and growing markets 37 million of incremental expenses related to the acquisition of hgst and 15 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 42 in 2012 compared to 32 in 2011 

during 2012 we recorded 214 million of net charges related to the flooding in thailand including 119 million of fixed asset impairments 61 million of recovery charges 28 million of writedowns of damaged inventory and 27 million in wage continuation during the shutdown period of our facilities offset by 21 million of insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements 

in addition during the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded 56 million of asset impairment charges 16 million of contract termination and other exit costs and 8 million of employee termination benefits 

other income expense other expense net was 14 million in 2012 compared to 1 million in 2011 interest expense increased from 10 million in 2011 to 26 million in 2012 primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance and a 5 million increase in debt commitment fees incurred prior to the closing of the acquisition offset by 4 million of gains on sales of our investments interest income increased from 9 million in 2011 to 12 million in 2012 due to higher average daily invested cash balances 

income tax provision income tax expense was 145 million in 2012 as compared to 54 million in 2011 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 83 in 2012 compared to 69 for 2011 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia the philippines singapore and thailand that expire at various dates through 2025 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

as of june 29 2012 we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 280 million which includes 39 million assumed in the acquisition aside from the increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to liabilities assumed in the acquisition we recognized a net decrease of 4 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2012 interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

  

the internal revenue service “irs” has completed its field examination of the federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for us and calendar years 2005 and 2006 for komag incorporated “komag” which was acquired by us on september 5 2007 in september 2011 we received a final revenue agent report “rar” and closing agreement with respect to the years under examination for komag this agreement resulted in an immaterial benefit to our income tax provision we have also received rars from the irs that seek adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately 970 million in connection with unresolved issues related primarily to transfer pricing and certain other intercompany transactions we disagree with the proposed adjustments in may 2011 we filed a protest with the irs appeals office regarding the proposed adjustments meetings with the appeals office began in february 2012 in january 2012 the irs commenced an examination of our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and komag’s period ended september 5 2007 

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of june 29 2012 it is not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months any significant change in the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our tax returns 

arbitration award 

as disclosed below in part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k on november 18 2011 a sole arbitrator ruled against us in an arbitration in minnesota the arbitration involves claims brought by seagate technology llc against us and a now former employee alleging misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets the arbitrator issued an interim award against us in the amount of 525 million plus preaward interest on january 23 2012 the arbitrator issued a final award adding preaward interest in the amount of 1054 million for a total award of 6304 million on january 23 2012 we filed a petition in the district court of hennepin county minnesota to have the final arbitration award vacated a hearing on the petition to vacate was held on march 1 2012 interest as simple interest not compounding on the final award 6304 million also accrues at the minnesota statutory rate of 10 per year while we pursue our motion to vacate the award and if necessary an appeal if the motion to vacate the award is unsuccessful we intend to pursue vigorously our motion to vacate the award and if necessary to appeal the award if it is confirmed by the district court of hennepin county minnesota we do not believe it is probable that the arbitrator’s award will be sustained and accordingly has not recorded any cost or liability for the arbitrator’s award in excess of the amount previously accrued by us 25 million we cannot make any assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to vacate the award or to overturn the award on appeal if we are unsuccessful in these efforts payment of the award including interest would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we will also be required to record a liability for the award if we should determine it is probable we will be required to pay the award 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

net revenue net revenue was 95 billion for 2011 a decrease of 3 from 2010 total hard drive shipments increased to 207 million units as compared to 194 million units for the prior year the decrease in net revenue resulted primarily from a 5 decrease in asp from 50 to 45 partially offset by the increase in unit shipments 

changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflected normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2011 these programs represented 11 of gross revenues compared to 8 in 2010 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

  

gross margin gross margin for 2011 was 18 billion a decrease of 610 million or 25 from the prior year gross margin as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 188 in 2011 from 244 in 2010 this decrease was primarily due to an aggressive pricing environment resulting in a lower asp 

operating expenses total rd expense and sga expense increased to 106 of net revenue in 2011 compared to 89 in 2010 rd expense was 703 million in 2011 an increase of 92 million or 15 over the prior year as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 74 in 2011 compared to 62 in 2010 this increase in rd expense was primarily due to the continued investment in product development to support new programs sga expense was 307 million in 2011 an increase of 42 million or 16 as compared to 2010 sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 32 in 2011 compared to 27 in 2010 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and growing markets as well as 17 million of expenses related to the acquisition of hgst 

other income expense other expense net was 1 million in 2011 compared to 5 million in 2010 this decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 5 million due to higher average daily invested cash balances and a 1 million decrease in our term loan interest expense due to a lower principal balance partially offset by acquisitionrelated debt commitment fees of 2 million 

income tax provision income tax expense was 54 million in 2011 as compared to 138 million in 2010 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 7 in 2011 compared to 9 for 2010 income tax expense for 2011 reflects the extension of the rd tax credit that was signed into law in december 2010 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia singapore and thailand that expire at various dates through 2023 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

we recognized a net increase of 15 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2011 as of july 1 2011 we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 245 million interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

liquidity and capital resources 

we ended 2012 with total cash and cash equivalents of 32 billion a decrease of 282 million from july 1 2011 the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended june 29 2012 in millions 

 

 our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds we believe our cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital debt and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

a total of 17 billion and 30 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the united states at june 29 2012 and july 1 2011 respectively substantially all of the amounts held outside of the united states are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations our current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations in the event funds from foreign operations are needed in the united states any repatriation could result in the accrual and payment of additional us income tax 

  

operating activities

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the average quarterly cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2012 were as follows 

 

 for 2012 our average days sales outstanding “dsos” increased by 2 days days in inventory “dios” increased by 10 days and days payables outstanding “dpos” increased by 8 days these increases were primarily due to the impact of including hgst’s accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable balances as of june 29 2012 but only including hgst’s revenue and cost of sales from the date of acquisition changes in average dsos and dios are generally related to linearity of shipments and the timing of inventory builds respectively changes in dpos are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for 2012 was 42 billion as compared to 793 million for 2011 and 986 million for 2010 during 2012 cash used in investing activities consisted of 35 billion net of cash acquired used for the acquisitions 76 million of proceeds related to the sale of equipment and capital expenditures of 717 million during 2011 cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of 778 million and 15 million for equipment related to the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility during 2010 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 737 million for capital expenditures 233 million used for the acquisition of the magnetic media sputtering operations of hoya and 20 million used for the acquisition of the land and building associated with the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility offset by 3 million of sales related to our auctionrate securities

purchase orders 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers which contain minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to these commitments 

as a result of the thailand floods and the impact on our ability to manufacture sufficient recording heads we entered into an agreement on november 15 2011 with sae magnetics hk ltd a subsidiary of tdk “sae” to supply incremental heads the agreement commenced in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and includes quarterly minimum volumes through fiscal 2013 we have had an ongoing supply relationship for heads with sae over periods spanning several years prior to this agreement 

foreign exchange contracts 

we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

indemnifications 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

  

unrecognized tax benefits 

as of june 29 2012 the cash portion of our total recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 245 million which included 29 million related to the acquisition we estimate the timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within the next one to five years see part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our total tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors previously authorized us to repurchase 750 million of our common stock in open market transactions under a stock repurchase program through march 31 2013 on may 21 2012 the company announced that the board of directors authorized an additional 15 billion for the repurchase of our common stock and the extension of our stock repurchase program until may 18 2017 as of june 29 2012 the entire 750 million previously authorized for repurchase had been utilized in addition as of june 29 2012 188 million of the 15 billion authorized on may 21 2012 had been utilized since the inception of this program in 2005 through june 29 2012 we have repurchased 36 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 938 million we repurchased 164 million shares for a total cost of 604 million during 2012 subsequent to june 29 2012 through august 16 2012 we repurchased an additional 21 million shares for a total cost of 91 million we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be made under a rule 10b51 plan we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

revenue and accounts receivable 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information and customer claim processing if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differs from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product generally total sales incentive and marketing programs range from 9 to 12 of gross revenues per quarter however for 2012 sales incentive and marketing programs were 6 of gross revenues due to the severe supply constraints across the hard drive industry brought about by the thailand floods changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 03 of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2010 customer sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue 

  

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could materially affect operating results 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

warranty 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

inventories 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value we use the firstin firstout “fifo” method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories while we use the weightedaverage method to value precious metal inventories weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production the weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a fifo method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible or where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

stockbased compensation 

we account for all stockbased compensation at fair value stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options and stock appreciation rights granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan purchase rights are estimated using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model we account for sars as liability awards based upon our intention to settle such awards in cash the sars liability is recognized for that portion of fair value for the service period rendered at the reporting date the sharebased liability is remeasured at each reporting date through the requisite service period both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition refer to part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated by reference in response to this item

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend disclosure about foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes currently we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the british pound sterling euro japanese yen malaysian ringgit philippine peso singapore dollar and thai baht singapore dollar and thai baht contracts are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges malaysian ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges british pound sterling euro japanese yen and philippine peso contracts are designated as fair value hedges see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

variable interest rate risk 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of the applicable borrower either a a libor rate determined by reference to the british bankers association libor rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing subject to certain exceptions the “eurodollar rate” or b a base rate determined by reference to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 ii the prime rate as announced by bank of america na and iii the eurodollar rate plus 100 the “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 150 to 250 with respect to borrowings at the eurodollar rate and 050 to 150 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis if the federal funds rate prime rate or libor rate increase our interest payments could also increase a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan facility would increase interest expense by approximately 22 million annually

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 29 2012 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

general 

 

we are a global provider of solutions for the collection storage management protection and use of digital content including audio and video our principal products are hard drives which are devices that use one or more rotating magnetic disks “magnetic media” to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are currently the primary storage medium for digital content our hard drives are used in desktop and notebook computers corporate and cloud computing data centers home entertainment equipment and standalone consumer storage devices in addition to hard drives our other products include solidstate drives and home entertainment and networking products 

 

business strategy 

 

our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of reliable high quality storage devices at a low total cost of ownership and with high efficiency and speed we have designed our business strategy to accommodate significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high asset utilization we believe this strategy helps accomplish the following 

 

  

industry 

 

we believe that growth in the unit sales within the electronic data storage industry has continued to outpace the growth in the unit sales of all personal computers “pcs” for example there were approximately 89 more hard drives sold than pcs in calendar 2010 based on industry data we believe the following factors continue to drive the unit growth of storage device sales in addition to pcs 

 

  

for a discussion of risks relating to the electronic data storage industry please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

client compute 

 

client compute storage devices consist of internal hard drives and solidstate drives for desktop and mobile pcs hard drives and solidstate drives store the computer operating system and application software as well as the data used by the applications desktop pcs are intended for regular use at a single location in homes businesses and multiuser networks mobile pcs primarily notebook computers are used both in and away from homes and businesses we believe that the demand for client compute hard drives and solidstate drives will grow primarily due to the increasing demand in emerging countries continued corporate refreshes the proliferation of digital content and requirements for increasing performance small size and low power consumption 

 

client noncompute 

 

external storage external storage devices supplement the storage space of pc systems for home and small office networks back up data on internal drives and are used for portability and security we believe there is a growing 

consumer need to back up personal digital content and externally expand storage capacity media players connect to a user’s television or home theater system and play digital movies music and photos from an integrated hard drive usb mass storage devices or content services accessed over the internet we also believe there is a growing need for consumers to play and view their personal stored digital content and premium content from the internet on their television and home theater system consistent with the growing trend to digitize rich content and data 

 

consumer electronics hard drives for ce products are primarily used in digital video recorders “dvrs” and game consoles dvrs offer greater consumer viewing flexibility and enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program game consoles enable users to save games movies music pictures and other user generated content we believe growth in consumer electronics will continue to create demand for higher capacity hard drives solidstate drives are also used in consumer electronics products which are primarily designed for small form factor battery powered consumer hand held devices such as tablets and smartphones 

 

enterprise 

 

enterprise storage devices consist of hard drives and solidstate drives for mission critical storage applications also referred to as traditional enterprise and nearline storage applications mission critical storage applications are essential to the operations of an enterprise and require high performance high reliability hard drives and solidstate drives nearline storage applications are business critical but require higher capacity and lower power consumption hard drives nearline hard drives are more cost effective than traditional enterprise hard drives while offering higher capacities and maintaining similar reliability scalability and performance nearline hard drives have stimulated applications such as video surveillance video editingbroadcasting and medical imaging and are also becoming commonplace for it infrastructure applications such as databases scientific computing web content web caching web search engines and electronic mail we believe that shipments of nearline hard drive units comprised approximately 41 of enterprise hard drives in calendar 2010 compared to 36 in calendar 2009 we believe that nearline hard drives will continue to consume a growing portion of the highest capacity hard drives in the next three years enterprise also consists of solidstate drives for use in embedded applications such as network communications industrial medical military and aerospace which require high durability and long life cycles 

 

there is a trend towards centralization of information storage and delivery of internetbased services through cloud computing cloud computing delivers shared resources software and information to users on demand on a multitude of devices such as client pcs and handheld computing devices most cloud computing models consist of services delivered through large data centers that utilize enterpriseclass servers the infrastructure to support cloud computing storage needs is driving the demand for enterpriseclass hard drives and solidstate drives 

 

other market opportunities 

 

we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve based on our significant investments we believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market penetration and be a fullline data storage solutions supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the recent past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions

research and development 

 

we devote substantial resources to the development of new products and improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses totaled 703 million 611 million and 509 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively for a discussion of risks related to our development of new products see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

technology and product development 

 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 

  

industrystandard interfaces allow the drives to communicate with the host system the primary interface for pcs is sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are sas fibre channel arbitrated loop “fcal” and sata 

 

the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” 

 

the hda includes heads magnetic media head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner and a pivotarm module on which the individual heads including suspension are mounted each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

 

the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a power device that controls the motor and hsa positioner and a system on chip soc comprised of a drive interface controller and recording channel 

the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

 

the storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density track density multiplied by bit density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area head and magnetic media technologies are two of the key components affecting areal density as areal density increases achieving a given drive capacity potentially reduces product costs over time through reduced component requirements we are vertically integrated in these two most important technology components of hard drives heads and magnetic media we also invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

 

solidstate drives use semiconductor nonvolatile media rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads to store and allow fast access to data without any moving parts the capacity of a solidstate drive is based on the total number of megabytes “mb” or gb of semiconductor media in the solidstate drive 

 

our products generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families and in some cases across product families resulting in the commonality of components which reduces our exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models for a discussion of risks related to technological innovations see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

sales and distribution 

 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of united states “us” companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 83 81 and 80 of our net revenue for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for a discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international customers see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms utilizing both consumer media and trade publications targeting various reseller and enduser categories we also maintain customer relationships through direct communication and providing information and support through our web site in accordance with standard hard drive industry practice we provide distributors and retailers with limited price protection and programs under which we reimburse certain marketing expenditures we also provide distributors resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs 

 

original equipment manufacturers oems purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an original design manufacturer “odm” and assemble them into the devices they build oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that allow for “buildtoorder” in which they do not build until there is a firm order for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our strong relationships with the leading oems 

 

distributors we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories 

 

retailers we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for wd and our products we also sell our branded products through our web site 

for 2011 and 2010 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for 2009 sales to dell inc accounted for 10 of our net revenue for a discussion of risks related to our customers refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customer information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

competition 

 

we compete with manufacturers of hard drives for client compute client noncompute and enterprise applications as well as manufacturers of solidstate drives our competitors include companies such as hitachi global storage technologies intel corporation micron technology inc samsung electronics co ltd seagate technology stec inc and toshiba corporation 

 

the storage industry is intensely competitive with hard drive and solidstate suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards and we believe there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market and we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors semiconductor media competes with hard drives along a range of product attributes in particular semiconductor media currently offers attractive functionality in consumer handheld applications requiring smaller form factors lower power and less storage capacity such as smartphones and tablets semiconductor media offers greater performance than hard drives in some storage applications advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could also result in competitive products for storing digital content with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis 

 

we differentiate wd by focusing on operational excellence high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating into our storage devices desirable product performance attributes we also differentiate wd by emphasizing nonproduct related attributes such as availability and rapid response to our customers which requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support we believe that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation its execution track record and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a storage device particularly in a rapidly changing technology environment 

 

seasonality 

 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year this seasonality is a result of consumer spending at the beginning of the school year and during the holiday season seasonality can also be impacted by the growth in emerging markets and macroeconomic conditions for a discussion of risks related to seasonality in our business see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

service and warranty 

 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned products for our customers for a further discussion of our service and warranty policy see part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

manufacturing 

 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes test and tooling execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and be able to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components the critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume and utilization low cost 

assembly and testing and maintaining close relationships with our strategic component suppliers to access bestofclass technology and manufacturing quality 

 

hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

 

we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous for a discussion of risks related to manufacturing see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

materials and supplies 

 

we use a number of components equipment goods and services in the manufacturing of our products the key components of our hard drives are 

 

  

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for our hard drives we acquire all of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers the major components used in the manufacture of our solidstate drives the semiconductor media and systemonchip and in our media players the controller are also acquired from third party suppliers we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons currently we believe that there are no major issues with component availability for a discussion of risks related to our component supplies see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

backlog 

 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition for many of our oems utilizing justintime inventory we do not generally require firm order commitments and instead receive a periodic forecast of requirements therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to prior periods 

 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

 

we own numerous patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the us 

 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell wd products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard drive industry for discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

environmental regulation 

 

we are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with our operations we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations for a discussion of risks related to environmental regulation see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

employees 

 

as of july 1 2011 we employed a total of 65431 employees worldwide excluding temporary employees and contractors many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors we consider our employee relations to be good for a discussion of risks related to our skilled employees see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

available information 

 

we maintain an internet web site at wwwwesterndigitalcom our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to sections 13a and 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended are available on our web site at wwwwesterndigitalcom free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic filing of these reports with or furnishing of these reports to the sec any materials we file with the sec are available at the sec’s public reference room at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 additional information about the operation of the public reference room can also be obtained by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 in addition the sec maintains a web site at wwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec including us

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the successful completion of our planned acquisition of hgst is subject to risks and uncertainties including obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals and our business may suffer in the event we fail to successfully complete the acquisition 

 

in march 2011 we announced our planned acquisition of hgst completion of the planned acquisition of hgst is subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to 

 

 12 

  

  

these risks and uncertainties regarding the acquisition may adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and customers which could harm our operating results in addition in the event that the acquisition is not completed or is delayed our business could suffer and the current market price of our common stock may decline 

 

even if we successfully complete our planned acquisition of hgst we may fail to successfully integrate hgst’s business into our operations and realize the anticipated benefits from such integration on a timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our business 

 

the success of our planned acquisition of hgst will depend on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating hgst’s business into our operations due to legal restrictions we and hgst have conducted and until the completion of the planned acquisition will conduct only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies following the acquisition our ongoing business could be disrupted and our management’s attention diverted due to these integration planning activities and as a result of the actual integration of the two companies following the acquisition following the planned acquisition we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from this integration on a timely basis or at all for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

  

if we are not able to successfully integrate hgst’s business and technology into our operations the anticipated benefits and efficiencies of the planned acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than 

expected and our ability to compete our revenue and gross margins and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the integration of hgst may result in significant restructuring charges that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company 

 

the financial results of the combined company may be adversely affected by cash expenses and noncash accounting charges incurred in connection with the combination the amount and timing of these possible charges are not yet known the price of our common stock following the acquisition could decline to the extent the combined company’s financial results are materially affected by these charges 

 

the financing of our planned hgst acquisition will dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest in the company and may have an adverse impact on our liquidity limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

 

our planned acquisition of hgst will be financed by a combination of the issuance of additional shares of our common stock the use of a significant amount of our cash on hand and the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness the issuance of additional shares of our common stock will dilute your ownership interest in the company the use of cash on hand and indebtedness to finance the acquisition will reduce our liquidity and could cause us to place more reliance on cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and development activities the credit agreement we expect to enter into with respect to the indebtedness we will incur to finance the planned acquisition contains restrictive covenants including financial covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control the indebtedness and these restrictive covenants will also have the effect among other things of impairing our ability to obtain additional financing if needed limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions in addition a breach of the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement we will enter into with respect to the indebtedness which if not cured or waived could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

 

adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

adverse global economic conditions and uncertain conditions in the credit market have had and in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our company and on the storage industry as a whole some of the risks and uncertainties we face as a result of these global economic and credit market conditions include the following 

 

 14 

  

  

we participate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to the risk of declining average selling prices “asps” volatile gross margins and significant shifts in market share all of which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

demand for our hard drives depends in large part on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and more intense price competition if more intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower asps revenue and gross margins our asps and gross margins also tend to decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors along with others may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants 

 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products or to quickly adjust to forecast changes could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions and a recent shift from air to ocean freight in response to increased transportation costs which requires additional lead times in addition because hard drives are designed to be largely substitutable our demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our competitors as forecasting demand becomes more difficult the risk that our forecasts are not in line with demand increases if our forecasts exceed actual market demand then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

 

we experience significant sales seasonality and cyclicality which could cause our operating results to fluctuate 

 

sales of computer systems storage subsystems and consumer electronics tend to be seasonal and cyclical and therefore we expect to continue to experience seasonality and cyclicality in our business as we respond to variations in our customers’ demand for hard drives in the desktop mobile ce and retail markets seasonality is partially attributable to the increase in sales of pcs and ce devices during the backtoschool and winter holiday seasons as such we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to be lower during the second half of our fiscal year however recently we have experienced strongerthananticipated demand partially driven by the increased adoption of sea freight in the pc supply chain in the enterprise market our sales are seasonal because of the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users however changes in seasonal and cyclical patterns have made it and could continue to make it more difficult for us to forecast demand especially in the current macroeconomic environment changes in the product or channel mix of our business can also impact seasonal and cyclical patterns adding complexity in forecasting demand seasonality and 

cyclicality also may lead to higher volatility in our stock price it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods because of the rate and unpredictability of product transitions and new product introductions and macroeconomic conditions 

 

our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates which may lower the prices our customers are willing to pay for our products or put us at a disadvantage to competing technologies 

 

our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result of 

 

  

demand for our products also could be negatively impacted by developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management the emergence of processes such as data deduplication and storage virtualization economic conditions and the rate of increase in areal density exceeding the increase in our customers’ demand for storage capacity these factors could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products that we do not offer thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to these developments in the demand for storage our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results our success in the retail market depends in large part on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our products in multiple channels adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd ®  brand products our operating results may be adversely affected 

 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to respond to demand changes in distribution markets or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken our operating results could suffer 

 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product in addition the pc market is experiencing a shift to notebook and other mobile devices and as a result more computing devices are being delivered to the market as complete systems which could weaken the distribution market if we fail to respond to changes in demand in the distribution market our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate 

technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to demand changes in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

 

during the year ended july 1 2011 a large percentage of our revenue 49 came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

 

our entry into additional storage markets increases the complexity of our business and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes as required by these new markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

 

as we expand our product line to sell into additional storage markets the overall complexity of our business increases at an accelerated rate and we become subject to different market dynamics the new markets into which we are expanding or may expand may have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently exist these different characteristics may include among other things demand volume requirements demand seasonality product generation development rates customer concentrations warranty and product return policies and performance and compatibility requirements our failure to make the necessary adaptations to our business model to address these different characteristics complexities and new market dynamics could adversely affect our operating results for example as we have previously disclosed we entered the traditional enterprise market in november 2009 in addition to requiring significant capital expenditures our entry into the traditional enterprise market adds complexity to our business that requires us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and different requirements of the traditional enterprise market while maintaining a competitive operating cost model if we fail to gain market acceptance in the traditional enterprise storage market we will remain at a competitive disadvantage to the companies that succeed in this market and our ability to continue our growth will be negatively affected 

 

expansion into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we do not successfully expand into new markets our business may suffer 

 

to remain a significant supplier of hard drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch or 25inch hard drives for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets however demand for hard drives may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer but which we do not expansion into other hard drive markets and resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may require us to make substantial additional investments in part because our operations are largely vertically integrated now that we manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture if we fail to successfully expand into new hard drive markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products 

our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing makes us dependent on our ability to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality and creates additional capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks to our business 

 

under our business plan we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

in addition as a result of our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if our overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

 

we make significant investments in research and development to improve our technology and develop new technologies and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

over the past several years our business strategy has been to derive a competitive advantage by moving from being a follower of new technologies to being a leader in the innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in research and development and in attempting to remain competitive we may increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model there can be no assurance that these investments will result in viable technologies or products or if these investments do result in viable technologies or products that they will be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is also critical to the success of our business we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain a technological or cost structure advantage 

 

further industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

 

the hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard drive industry may over extended periods of time sell hard drives at prices that we cannot profitably match 

 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to achieve profitability they may sell hard drives at lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonhard drive products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their hard drives at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers or if product life cycles lengthen it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures 

 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated 

 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our hard drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition a product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or customer relationships and may cause us to lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 

dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays lost revenue or increased costs 

 

our future operating results may depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines as such the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts from reliable component suppliers to do so we must maintain effective relationships with our supply base to source our component needs develop compatible technology and maintain continuity of supply at reasonable costs if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our supply base or if we fail to integrate components from our suppliers effectively this may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver the best products to our customers and our profitability could suffer 

certain equipment and consumables we use in our manufacturing or testing processes are available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment and consumables use materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

each of the following could also significantly harm our operating results 

 

  

shortages of commodity materials or commodity components price volatility or use by other industries of materials and components used in the hard drive industry may negatively impact our operating results 

 

increases in the cost for certain commodity materials or commodity components may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives and key components shortages of commodity components such as dram and nand flash or commodity materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium platinum or cerium may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs we or our suppliers acquire certain precious metals and rare earth metals like ruthenium platinum neodymium and cerium critical to the manufacture of components in our products from a number of countries including the people’s republic of china the government of china or any other nation may impose regulations quotas or embargoes upon these metals that would restrict the worldwide supply of such metals andor increase their cost both of which could negatively impact our operating results until alternative suppliers are sourced furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components used in our products our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other commodity components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results the volatility in the cost of oil also affects our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers 

 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of uncertain global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

 

failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components technology or production equipment for our products may adversely affect our operations 

 

we rely on suppliers for various component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves such as semiconductors motors flex circuits and suspensions likewise we rely on suppliers for certain 

technology and equipment necessary for advanced development technology for future products some of these components and most of this technology and production equipment must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of with whom we are sole sourced we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated with our products and technology and production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently the failure of these suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components that can be integrated into our products or technology and production equipment that can be used to develop or manufacture next generation products may cause us to experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment of hard drive products our expansion into new technology and markets or our ability to remain competitive with alternative storage technologies therefore adversely affecting our business and financial results 

 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some revolutionary technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic recording energy assisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and advanced signal processing that if implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads magnetic media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire 

 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however increasing areal density has become more difficult in the hard drive industry if we are not able to increase areal density at the same rate as our competitors or at a rate that is expected by our customers we may be required to include more components in our drives to meet demand without corresponding incremental revenue which could negatively impact our operating margins and make achieving historical levels of cost reduction difficult or unlikely additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gb per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

if we do not properly manage technology transitions and new product development our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner if we fail to implement these new technologies successfully or if we are slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to competitively offer products that our customers desire which could harm our operating results 

 

in addition the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of other factors including 

 

  

our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with our product development 

 

if we fail to develop and introduce new hard drives that are competitive against alternative storage technologies our business may suffer 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with competing technologies alternative storage technologies like solidstate storage technology have successfully served digital entertainment markets for products such as digital cameras mp3 players usb flash drives mobile phones and tablet devices that cannot be economically serviced using hard drive technology advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in solidstate storage emerging as a technology that is competitive with hard drives for high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers and storage solidstate storage is produced by large semiconductor companies who can then sell their storage products at lower prices while still remaining profitable overall this can help them improve their market share at the expense of the competition in addition these semiconductor companies may choose to supply companies like us with semiconductor media at prices that make it difficult if not impossible for us to compete with them on a profitable basis as a result there can be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and developing new products for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets in response to solidstate storage as well as other competing technologies if our hard drive technology fails to offer higher capacity performance and reliability with lower costpergigabyte than solidstate storage for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology to serve these markets and our business will suffer 

 

our manufacturing operations and those of certain of our suppliers and customers are concentrated in large purposebuilt facilities which subjects us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our manufacturing operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities for example a substantial majority of our requirement for heads is satisfied by wafers fabricated in our fremont california facility also we manufacture the majority of our substrates for magnetic media in our johor malaysia facility and we finish a majority of our magnetic media in our facilities in penang malaysia and tuas singapore a majority of our high volume hard drive manufacturing operations are conducted in our two facilities in thailand with the balance conducted in our kuala lumpur malaysia facility and the facilities of our contract manufacturers in asia brazil europe and the united states as part of our planned acquisition of hgst we will also acquire manufacturing facilities located in japan china and the philippines as well as additional factories in singapore thailand and malaysia the manufacturing facilities of many of our customers our suppliers and our customers’ suppliers are also concentrated in certain geographic locations in asia and elsewhere a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our or our customers’ other suppliers such as the spread of the influenza a h1n1 or a new pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture andor 

sell which would result in substantial harm to our operating results similarly a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities would significantly affect our ability to manufacture andor sell hard drives which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results 

 

for example while we presently do not have manufacturing operations located in japan we do source certain components from suppliers with facilities in japan the march 2011 earthquakes tsunami and related events in japan including the resulting power outages have affected and may continue to affect the supply of certain components used in the production of hard drives and systems that include hard drives the development of events in japan has however been fluid and unpredictable if we experience any shortage of components of acceptable quality or any interruption in the supply of required components we cannot promptly obtain from alternative sources at acceptable prices our operating results would be adversely affected in addition even if the events in japan do not adversely affect our component supply they may adversely affect the supply of other components our customers use in their systems which could negatively impact demand for our products and therefore our revenues 

 

manufacturing outside the united states and marketing our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing efforts including 

 

  

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air ocean or land freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or freight lanes such as due to labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products 

we are vulnerable to system failures or attacks which could harm our business 

 

we are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure among other functions to operate our factories sell our products fulfill orders manage inventory and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events our business is also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our business which could harm our reputation and financial condition 

 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions it may adversely affect our future results 

 

as part of our growth strategy we may pursue acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transaction some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all if we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our future results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

if we are unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our business results may suffer 

 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as well as attract integrate and retain new skilled employees volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted by global economic conditions we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 

 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

 

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade and tax regulations and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs 

 

we may be or become subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our component suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs for example the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change and financial reform legislation in the united states is a significant topic of discussion and has generated and may continue to generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers could harm our business 

 

we expect our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or divergence of a supplier’s business practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states could harm our business by 

 

 25 

 

  

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from japanese and other nonus based vendors if the us dollar continues to weaken against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin if this occurs it would have a negative impact on our operating results 

 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the united states therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the united states fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the united states 

 

we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place currently we hedge the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and british pound sterling with foreign exchange contracts 

 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs 

 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing and fulfillment services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

our operating results fluctuate sometimes significantly from period to period due to many factors which may result in a significant decline in our stock price 

 

our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

 26 

 

  

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter as a result of the above or other factors our forecast of operating results for the quarter may differ materially from our actual financial results if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our stock price 

 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting and actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions 

 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

  

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors that may significantly affect the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

 27 

 

in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

current economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from financial institution failures 

 

the uncertain global economic conditions and volatile investment markets have caused us to hold more cash and cash equivalents than we would hold under normal circumstances since there has been an overall increase in demand for lowrisk us governmentbacked securities with a limited supply in the financial marketplace we face increased difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and other financial institutions a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could have an adverse impact on our financial position 

 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 

 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 1 2011 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods however if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness in our financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price 

 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination by the internal revenue service for certain fiscal years and in connection with that examination we received revenue agent reports seeking certain adjustments to income as disclosed in part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k although we believe our tax positions are properly supported the final timing and resolution of the notice of proposed adjustment and the audits are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations net income or cash flows

results of operations 

 

fiscal 2011 overview 

 

in 2011 our net revenue decreased by 3 to 95 billion on hard drive shipments of 207 million units as compared to 98 billion and 194 million units in 2010 in 2011 64 of our hard drive net revenue was derived from compute markets including notebook and desktop computers as compared to 67 in 2010 hard drive asp decreased to 45 in 2011 from 50 in 2010 gross margin percentage decreased to 188 in 2011 from 244 in 2010 in 2011 operating income decreased from 15 billion to 781 million which included a 25 million accrual for litigation contingencies and 17 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition of hgst as a percentage of net revenue operating income was 82 in 2011 compared to 155 in 2010 net income in 2011 was 726 million or 309 per diluted share compared to 14 billion or 593 per diluted share in 2010 

 

for the september quarter we expect our revenue to increase slightly from the june quarter primarily as a result of seasonality 

summary comparison of 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented selected summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding unit shipments asps and revenues by geography and channel in millions except percentages and asps 

 

 

 

 

  

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” operating results for the magnetic media sputtering operations of hoya corporation and hoya magnetics singapore pte ltd together “hoya” and siliconsystems inc “siliconsystems” which were acquired on june 30 2010 and march 27 2009 respectively are included in our operating results only after the dates of their acquisitions 

 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

 

net revenue net revenue was 95 billion for 2011 a decrease of 3 from 2010 total hard drive shipments increased to 207 million units as compared to 194 million units for the prior year the decrease in net revenue resulted primarily from a 5 decrease in asp from 50 to 45 partially offset by the increase in unit shipments 

changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2011 and 2009 these programs represented 11 of gross revenues compared to 8 in 2010 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2011 was 18 billion a decrease of 610 million or 25 from the prior year gross margin as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 188 in 2011 from 244 in 2010 this decrease was primarily due to an aggressive pricing environment resulting in a lower asp 

 

operating expenses total research and development “rd” expense and selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased to 106 of net revenue in 2011 compared to 89 in 2010 rd expense was 703 million in 2011 an increase of 92 million or 15 over the prior year as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 74 in 2011 compared to 62 in 2010 this increase in rd expense was primarily due to the continued investment in product development to support new programs sga expense was 307 million in 2011 an increase of 42 million or 16 as compared to 2010 sga expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to 32 in 2011 compared to 27 in 2010 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and growing markets as well as 17 million of expenses related to the planned acquisition of hgst 

 

other income expense other expense net was 1 million in 2011 compared to 5 million in 2010 this decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 5 million due to higher average daily invested cash balances and a 1 million decrease in our term loan interest expense due to a lower principal balance partially offset by acquisitionrelated debt commitment fees of 2 million 

 

income tax provision income tax expense was 54 million in 2011 as compared to 138 million in 2010 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 7 in 2011 compared to 9 for 2010 income tax expense for 2011 reflects the extension of the rd tax credit that was signed into law in december 2010 the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia singapore and thailand that expire at various dates through 2023 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

 

we recognized a net increase of 15 million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2011 as of july 1 2011 we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 245 million interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 

 

the united states internal revenue service “irs” is currently examining our fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and calendar years 2005 and 2006 for komag incorporated “komag” which was acquired by us on september 5 2007 the irs has completed its field work and proposed certain adjustments certain issues have been agreed upon by us and the irs and certain issues remain unresolved we have received revenue agent reports “rars” for the agreed issues we have also received rars from the irs for the unresolved issues that seek adjustments to our income before income taxes of approximately 970 million and 380 million for komag the issues in dispute relate primarily to transfer pricing and certain other intercompany transactions we disagree with the proposed adjustments in may 2011 we filed a protest with the irs appeals office regarding the proposed adjustments for western digital we are continuing discussions with the irs to resolve the komag issues 

 

we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs as of july 1 2011 it is not possible to estimate the amount of change if any in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months 

 

fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

 

net revenue net revenue was 98 billion for 2010 an increase of 32 from 2009 total hard drive shipments increased to 194 million units as compared to 146 million units for the prior year the increase in net revenue resulted 

primarily from an increase in unit shipments due to the strong demand for hard drives particularly in the mobile pc market we shipped 80 million mobile drives in 2010 as compared to 55 million units in 2009 the increase in mobile unit shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and netbook pc demand coupled with increased customer preference for our product offerings 

 

changes in revenue by geography generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as well as demand strength in asia which continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region changes in revenue by channel are a result of normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2010 these programs represented 8 of gross revenues compared to 11 in 2009 and 10 in 2008 respectively these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2010 was 24 billion an increase of 11 billion or 80 over the prior year gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 244 in 2010 from 179 in 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher volume lower costs a favorable product mix and a moderate pricing environment 

 

operating expenses total rd expense and sga expense decreased to 89 of net revenue in 2010 compared to 95 in 2009 rd expense was 611 million in 2010 an increase of 102 million or 20 over the prior year this increase in rd expense was primarily due to a 68 million increase relating to product development to support new programs and a 34 million increase in variable incentive compensation as a percentage of net revenue rd expense decreased to 62 in 2010 compared to 68 in 2009 primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 sga expense was 265 million in 2010 an increase of 64 million or 32 as compared to 2009 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to 27 million of expense related to litigation settlements a 19 million increase in variable incentive compensation and an 18 million increase in the expansion of our sales and marketing presence into new regions sga expense as a percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 27 in 2010 and 2009 

 

during 2009 we recorded a 14 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of siliconsystems this charge relates to projects that were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use and therefore the fair value of the development effort did not qualify for capitalization and was immediately expensed during 2009 we also recorded 112 million in restructuring charges and an 18 million gain on the sale of our substrate manufacturing facility and related assets in sarawak malaysia 

 

other income expense other expense net was 5 million in 2010 compared to 18 million in 2009 this decrease was primarily due to no impairment charges related to our auctionrate securities in 2010 compared to 10 million in otherthantemporary losses in 2009 as well as decreases in the variable interest rate on a lower amount of debt 

 

income tax provision income tax expense was 138 million in 2010 as compared to 31 million in 2009 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 9 in 2010 compared to 6 for 2009 in 2009 income tax expense included a provision of 42 million offset by 6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the us federal research and development tax credit enacted into law in october 2008 and a favorable adjustment of 5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate were primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various dates through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

 

we recognized a net 94 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2010 as of july 2 2010 we had approximately 230 million of unrecognized tax benefits which if recognized would decrease the effective tax rate in subsequent years 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we ended 2011 with total cash and cash equivalents of 35 billion an increase of 756 million from july 2 2010 the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended july 1 2011 in millions 

 

 

 

our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through the foreseeable future our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was 17 billion as compared to 19 billion for 2010 and 13 billion for 2009 cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash provided by working capital changes was 238 million for 2011 as compared to net cash used to fund working capital of 37 million for 2010 and net cash provided by working capital changes of 198 million for 2009 

 

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the average quarterly cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2011 were as follows 

 

 

 

for 2011 our average days sales outstanding “dsos” increased by one day days in inventory “dios” increased by four days and days payables outstanding “dpos” increased by three days changes in average dsos and dios are generally related to linearity of shipments and the timing of inventory builds respectively changes in dpos are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities for 2011 was 793 million as compared to 986 million for 2010 and 551 million for 2009 during 2011 cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of 778 million and 15 million for equipment related to the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility during 2010 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 737 million for capital expenditures 233 million used for the acquisition of the magnetic media sputtering operations of hoya and 20 million used for the acquisition of the land and 

building associated with the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility offset by 3 million of sales related to our auctionrate securities during 2009 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 519 million for capital expenditures and 63 million for the acquisition of siliconsystems net of cash acquired partially offset by 29 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment capital expenditures in 2011 primarily consisted of the expansion of our head wafer fabrication facilities continued investment in advanced head technologies and increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio 

 

for fiscal 2012 we expect capital expenditures will be at the upper end of our business model range of between 7 and 8 percent of revenue as we continue the conversion of our head wafer fabrication facilities to utilize 8inch wafers from 6inch wafers we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 650 million for fiscal 2012 

 

our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market funds that are invested in us treasury securities us treasury bills and us government agency securities we also have 15 million of auctionrate securities which are classified as availableforsale securities

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers which contain minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to these commitments 

 

foreign exchange contracts 

 

we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

indemnifications 

 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular 

agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

 

unrecognized tax benefits 

 

as of july 1 2011 the cash portion of our total recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits was 147 million we estimate the timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within the next one to five years see part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our total tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

our board of directors previously authorized us to repurchase 750 million of our common stock in open market transactions under a stock repurchase program through march 31 2013 since the inception of this program in 2005 through july 1 2011 we have repurchased 20 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 334 million we repurchased 18 million shares for a total cost of 50 million during 2011 we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows 

 

planned acquisition termination fee 

 

if the planned acquisition of hgst has not closed by march 7 2012 due to the failure to receive any required antitrust or competition authority’s consent approval or clearance or any action by any certain governmental entities to prevent the planned acquisition for antitrust or competition reasons we will concurrently with such termination be required to pay hitachi a fee of 250 million in cash 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

 

revenue and accounts receivable 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information and customer claim processing if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differs from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product since 2009 total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 7 to 12 of gross revenues per quarter changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 03 of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2009 customer sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded as a reduction of revenue 

 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging 

categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could materially affect operating results 

 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

 

warranty 

 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

inventory 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value we use the firstin firstout “fifo” method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories while we use the weightedaverage method to value precious metal inventories weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production the weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a fifo method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

 

litigation and other contingencies 

 

when we become aware of a claim or potential claim we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure we disclose information regarding each material claim where the likelihood of a loss contingency is probable or reasonably possible if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we record an accrual for the loss in such cases there may be an exposure to potential loss in excess of the amount accrued where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible and where a loss in excess of the amount accrued is reasonably possible we disclose an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim if a reasonable estimate can be made unless the amount of such reasonably possible losses is not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual 

outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefits in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for all stockbased compensation at fair value stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan “espp” purchase rights are estimated using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on our results of operations and financial condition refer to part ii item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated by reference in response to this item

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes currently we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and british pound sterling thai baht contracts are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges malaysian ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges euro and british pound sterling contracts are designated as fair value hedges see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

as of july 1 2011 we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

 

 

 

 

  

in 2011 2010 and 2009 total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

 

disclosure about other market risks 

 

variable interest rate risk 

 

borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of wdti either a a libor rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs the “eurocurrency rate” or b a base rate determined by reference to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 and ii the prime rate as announced by jpmorgan chase bank na the “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility ranges from 125 to 150 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margins for borrowings under the term loan facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis if the federal funds rate prime rate or libor rate increase our interest payments could also increase a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the term loan facility would increase interest expense by approximately 3 million annually

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see page 46 herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended july 1 2011 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

general 

 

we design develop manufacture and sell hard drives a hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks “magnetic media” to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are key components of computers including desktop and notebook computers “pcs” data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic “ce” devices 

 

we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and original design manufacturers “odms” for use in computer systems subsystems or ce devices and to distributors resellers and retailers our hard drives are used in desktop computers notebook computers and enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage storage area networks and video surveillance equipment additionally our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” we also sell our hard drives as standalone storage products by integrating them into finished enclosures embedding application software and offering the products as wd ® branded external storage appliances for personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music photographs video and other digital data 

 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device our hard drives currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives having capacities ranging from 80 gigabytes “gb” to 2 terabytes “tb” nominal rotation speeds up to 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” serial advanced technology attachment “sata” and serial attached scsi small computer system interface “sas” we also embed our hard drives into wd ® branded external storage appliances using interfaces such as universal serial bus “usb” 20 usb 30 external sata firewire tm and ethernet network connections with capacities of 160 gb up to 8 tb in addition we offer a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives utilizing our wd greenpower technology tm  

 

we also design develop manufacture and sell solidstate drives and media players a solidstate drive is a storage device that uses semiconductor nonvolatile media rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads to store and allow fast access to data we sell our solidstate drives worldwide to oems and distributors for use in the embedded systems and client pc markets a media player is a device that connects to a user’s television the internet andor home theater system and plays digital movies music and photos from any of our wd ® branded external hard drives other usb mass storage devices or content services accessed over the internet we sell our media players worldwide to resellers and retailers under the wd ® brand 

 

in november 2009 we entered the traditional enterprise market with our wd s25 which is a 25inch sas interface hard drive the wd s25 drive provides up to 300 gb of storage suitable for both missioncritical enterprise server and enterprise storage applications as well as data centers and large data arrays 

 

business strategy 

 

our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of reliable high quality hard drives at a low total cost of ownership and with high efficiency and speed we believe this strategy helps accomplish the following 

 

  

we have designed our business strategy to accommodate significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high asset utilization 

industry 

 

we design develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop and mobile pc enterprise ce and external hard drive markets we believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has continued to outpace the growth in the sales of all pcs as there were approximately 86 more hard drives sold in the market than pcs in calendar 2009 based on industry data we believe the following factors continue to drive the growth of hard drive sales in addition to pc applications 

 

  

additionally we believe that the demand for 25inch hard drives has grown from approximately 16 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2003 to 48 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2009 driven by the growing markets for notebook and netbook computers game consoles and external storage 

 

we design develop and manufacture solidstate drives for the embedded systems market we also develop products with solidstate drive technology for emerging consumer and commercial computing markets 

 

we also design develop and manufacture wd ® branded media players for the retail channel we believe there is a growing need for consumers to play their personal stored digital content and premium content from the internet on their television and home theater system in connection with the growing trend in the digitization of rich content and data 

 

these factors and our product expansion strategy have gradually increased our percentage of net revenue derived from nondesktop sources in 2010 64 of our net revenue was from nondesktop sources compared to 62 in 2009 and 56 in 2008 

 

for an additional discussion of risks relating to the hard drive industry please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

desktop pc market 

 

the desktop pc market consists of personal computers in a form intended for regular use at a single location individuals use desktop computers in homes businesses and multiuser networks desktop computers use software applications for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and for other needs hard drives store the desktop computer operating system and application software as well as the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop pc market has grown in part due to 

 

  

we believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop computer unit growth including growth of notebook and netbook computers an increase in firsttime buyers of desktop computers in asia eastern europe and latin america 

maturing desktop pc markets in north america and western europe and the lengthening of desktop computer replacement cycles 

 

mobile pc market 

 

the mobile pc market consists primarily of notebook and netbook computers individuals use mobile computers both in and away from homes and businesses like desktop computers mobile computers use software applications for various needs hard drives store the mobile computer operating system and application software as well as the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile pc market has grown in part due to 

 

  

we expect the mobile pc market to continue to grow faster than the desktop or enterprise markets in the next five years as the mobile pc market continues to evolve to a higher volume market we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on attributes such as quality availability reliability execution flexibility capacity performance power and the competitive cost structures of their hard drive suppliers these are the same attributes that have been emphasized for many years by customers in the highvolume desktop pc market 

 

enterprise market 

 

the enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations servers network attached storage storage area networks other computing systems or subsystems networkcommunications and video surveillance hard drives for this market utilize three principal interfaces fibre channel arbitrated loop “fcal” sas interface technology or sata sata hard drives typically cost customers less than sas or fcal hard drives while offering higher capacities and maintaining similar reliability scalability and performance 

 

we believe that enterprise uses of sata hard drives will continue to increase during the past few years a new application has emerged with highcapacity sata hard drives augmenting fcal and sas hard drives tape and optical media this application popularly referred to as “nearline” storage has created a growth market because sata hard drives access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions quickly retrieve critical backup or nearline data and are more cost effective than fcal and sas hard drives the low price per capacity of sata drives has stimulated applications such as video surveillance video editingbroadcasting and medical imaging these applications represent segments of a growing market for high capacity storage in noncomputing imaging and multimedia professions 

 

enterpriseclass sata drives are becoming commonplace for it infrastructure applications such as databases scientific computing surveillance web content web caching web search engines and electronic mail these applications have become an important market for highcapacity sata hard drives we believe that this market will consume a growing portion of the highest capacity hard drives in the next three years 

 

sata technology is compatible with sas technology enabling customers the flexibility of incorporating sata hard drives in sas storage systems we believe the units shipped in the enterpriseclass sata market was approximately 36 of the enterprise hard drive market in calendar 2009 

 

highperformance server applications including blade servers are increasingly using 25inch form factor hard drives supplanting traditional 35inch drives smaller form factors enable more drives per physical space for increased performance higher capacity per square foot and lower power consumption this trend demonstrates the fragmentation of the enterprise hard drive market and the need for applicationspecific enterpriseclass hard drives 

there is a trend towards centralization of information storage and delivery of internetbased services through cloud computing cloud computing delivers shared resources software and information to users on demand on a multitude of devices such as client pcs and handheld computing devices most cloud computing models consist of services delivered through common data centers that utilize servers and hard drives designed for the enterprise market the infrastructure to support cloud computing storage needs is driving the demand for both sas and sata enterpriseclass hard drives 

 

consumer electronics market 

 

the use of hard drives in ce products has been a major growth area in recent years currently the two largest segments of this market are 

 

  

dvrs are available for use in home entertainment systems and offer enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program additionally digital video disk “dvd” recorders increasingly incorporate hard drives to allow for dvr functionality and faster recording of content onto removable dvds the market for these products favors larger capacity hard drives and continues to grow globally we believe growth in this market will continue to build demand for higher capacity hard drives 

 

game consoles are increasingly incorporating hard drives to improve the user experience hard drive technology enables users to save games movies music pictures and other user generated content 

 

the proliferation in the ce market of more sophisticated mobile devices including smartphones portable media players and tablet computers is driving the delivery of diverse content from hard drive intensive hosts we believe this is one of the factors influencing increased sales of enterpriseclass sata drives we also believe that multimedia handheld devices such as video cameras and highresolution still cameras are enabling consumer production of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of small formfactor hard drive storage as well as highcapacity desktopclass hard drives for editing manipulation and longterm storage of such content 

 

external hard drive market 

 

most new pc systems include highspeed external interfaces such as usb 20 usb 30 external sata firewire tm or ethernet network connections that permit users to supplement the storage space of their pc systems or home and small office networks with the use of external hard drives users store additional programs or multimedia content and back up internal hard drives with external hard drives as well as use mobile external hard drives for portability and security external storage can often be the easiest quickest or only way of adding additional storage capacity to either a desktop or notebook computer we believe there is an increasing consumer awareness of the need and value of securely storing personal digital content through backup applications and devices we believe there is a growing need for external storage as a way of expanding storage capacity in ce devices such as dvrs we also believe there is a growing need for media players that enable consumers to play digital movies and music view photos and access the internet otherwise limited to being viewed on computer screens from usb mass storage devices on their television or home theater system 

 

solidstate drive market 

 

the solidstate drive market consists primarily of solidstate drives which use semiconductor nonvolatile media that retains data even when power is not applied using either singlelevel cell or multilevel cell nand media 

 

we believe that the demand for solidstate drives in certain markets has grown in part due to 

 

 7 

 

we expect the solidstate drive market to grow faster on a compounded annual growth rate basis than the hard drive market over the next four years but will still remain a small portion of the total storage market on a unit basis 

 

other market opportunities 

 

we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve based on significant investments we made over the last six years we believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market penetration and be a fullline hard drive supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the recent past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions

technology and product development 

 

hard drives record store and retrieve digital data performance attributes of hard drives such as their ability to access and transmit data and storage capacity are currently better than removable disks optical hard drives and tapes and they are more costeffective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 

  

all of our hard drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” 

 

hda the hda includes heads magnetic media head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made 

up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner a pivotarm module on which the individual heads are mounted each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

 

pcba the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

 

industrystandard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interfaces for pcs are pata and sata the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are sata and the following which we refer to as traditional enterprise scsi sas and fcal as computer performance continues to improve the hard drive will need to deliver information faster we believe this will continue to drive the transition of the pc industry to higher speed interfaces such as sata and sas to facilitate the higher data transfer rates we currently offer the sata interface on our wd caviar ®  wd scorpio ®  wd ® re wd velociraptor ® and wd ® av hard drive families the pata interface on wd caviar ®  wd scorpio ® and wd ® av hard drive families and the sas interface on the wd s25 hard drive family 

 

the number of disks and each disk’s areal density track density multiplied by bit density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area determines storage capacity of the hard drive the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter achieving a given drive capacity requires fewer disks and heads as the areal density increases potentially reducing product costs over time through reduced component requirements in september 2009 we began shipping our wd caviar ® black tm 35inch 2 tb drives at 500 gb per platter areal density in march 2010 we began shipping our wd scorpio ® blue tm 25inch 750 gb drives at 375 gb per platter areal density 

 

head technology is one of the key components affecting areal density the hard drive industry has transitioned from the use of longitudinal magnetic recording “lmr” head technology for the head writer function to perpendicular magnetic recording “pmr” technology which allows for significantly higher storage capacities in addition the industry has made the transition to tunneljunction magneto resistive “tmr” technology for the head reader function we have completed the transition to pmr and tmr across all of our product platforms 

 

with the transition to pmr magnetic media plays a much more important role in achieving higher areal density pmr demands a much tighter interaction and matching between head and magnetic media designs we are vertically integrated in the two most important technology components of hard drives heads and magnetic media which has enabled us to achieve a more optimum design and utilization of these components 

 

we invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

 

solidstate drives record store and retrieve digital data without any moving parts attributes such as fast readwrite speeds low power consumption and robust durability offer greater performance than hard drives in some storage applications but are currently much more costly per gb and are available in much lower capacity points than hard drives the main components of a solidstate drive are the systemonchip and semiconductor media the capacity of a solidstate drive is based on the total number of mb or gb of semiconductor media in the solidstate drive industrystandard storage interface protocols such as sata patacf and usb 20 allow the solidstate drive to communicate with the host system 

 

the wd ® product lines generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families and in some cases across product families which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models

sales and distribution 

 

we sell our products globally to oems odms distributors and retailers oems purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an odm and assemble them into the computer or ce systems they build distributors typically sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers retailers typically sell our products directly to endusers through their storefront or online facilities 

 

original equipment manufacturers 

 

sales to oems which include sales through odms accounted for 51 54 and 51 of our net revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively for 2010 and 2008 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue for 2009 sales to dell inc accounted for 10 of our net revenue we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our strong relationships with the leading oems 

 

oems evaluate and select their hard drive and solidstate drive suppliers based on a number of factors including quality and reliability storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability oems typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and once an oem has chosen its qualified vendors for a given product it generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with oem qualifications a supplier must consistently offer products featuring leading technology quality and reliability at acceptable capacity suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of each new generation of high quality and reliable hard drives or solidstate drives requiring access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities 

 

many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” in which they do not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” in which the oem contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer such as an odm who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the oem’s instructions for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our need to adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

distributors 

 

we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors accounted for approximately 31 26 and 31 of our net revenue for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in those territories we grant our distributors limited price protection 

 

retailers 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers retailers accounted for approximately 18 20 and 18 of our net revenue for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for wd and our products retailers supply endusers with our products to upgrade their computers externally store their data for backup or mobility purposes and play their stored digital content or content accessed over the internet on their television or home theater systems we grant our retailers limited price protection we also sell our branded products through our web site 

sales and marketing 

 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of united states “us” companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 81 80 and 76 of our net revenue for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for an additional discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international customers see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customer information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms we target advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and enduser categories we utilize both consumer media and trade publications we have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures we also maintain customer relationships by communicating with our resellers and providing endusers with information and support through our web site 

 

competition 

 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use in desktop notebook enterprise ce and external storage products our competitors in the hard drive market include companies such as hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics co ltd seagate technology and toshiba corporation 

 

the hard drive industry is intensely competitive with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors 

 

we believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products therefore we believe that we cannot differentiate wd ® hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly we differentiate wd by focusing on operational excellence high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating into our hard drives desirable product performance attributes such performance attributes include seek times data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics error recovery low operating temperature low power consumption and optimized streaming capabilities 

 

in addition we differentiate wd by emphasizing nonproduct related attributes including rapid response to our customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction we also rely on the strength of the wd brand name with valueadded resellers retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive products directly and indirectly we believe that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation its execution track record and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard drive particularly in a rapidly changing technology environment 

 

advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis 

 

highspeed semiconductor media competes with hard drive products in some applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage semiconductor media is much faster in some applications than magnetic hard drives but currently is not competitive in most applications using 35inch and 25inch form factor hard drives from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor media is currently much more costly and while it 

has higher “read” performance attributes than hard drives it has lower “write” performance attributes flash memory could become more competitive in the near future for additional applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives however we believe that the traditional highvolume computing markets will remain the domain of 35inch and 25inch hard drives based on the hard drive industry’s attributes of reliability availability storage capacity and cost 

 

our competitors in the external hard drive market include companies such as emc corporation hitachi global storage technologies lacie sa melco holdings inc and seagate technology our competitors in the solidstate drive market include companies such as intel corporation micron technology inc samsung electronics co ltd smart modular technologies inc and stec inc our competitors in the media player retail market include companies such as apple inc emc corporation lacie sa roku inc and seagate technology 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to competition see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

seasonality 

 

we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in our business with higher levels of demand in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year this seasonality is a result of consumer spending at the beginning of the school year and during the holiday season 

 

service and warranty 

 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions including africa asia pacific australia europe india latin america the middle east and north america to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned products for our customers 

 

manufacturing 

 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and have the ability to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations to be competitive we must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components that we manufacture ourselves while insisting that our suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume and utilization low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key supplier relationships by establishing close relationships with our strategic component suppliers we believe we access bestofclass technology and manufacturing quality in addition we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

 

hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

 

we manufacture hard drives in malaysia and thailand we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

 

we use our wafer fabrication facilities in fremont california and our slider fabrication facility in bang pain thailand to design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and head gimbal assemblies “hgas” we include in the hard drives we manufacture 

we have magnetic media and substrate design and manufacturing facilities in malaysia we also have a magnetic media design and manufacturing facility in singapore we use these facilities to design and manufacture most of the magnetic media and substrates that we use in our products 

 

we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

materials and supplies 

 

the following products are the major components currently used in the manufacture of our hard drives 

 

  

we also use several other components in our hard drives such as seals filters plastic molded parts capacitors resistors connectors and cables 

 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for the hard drives we manufacture we purchase a portion of these components from third party suppliers we acquire all of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers 

 

the major components used in the manufacture of our solidstate drives the semiconductor media and systemonchip and in our media player the controller are acquired from third party suppliers 

 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons we believe that components are generally available 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our component supplies see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

backlog 

 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order we generally negotiate pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions before receiving a customer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition we make many of our sales to oems under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead we receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods 

 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

 

we own numerous patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the us 

 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell wd products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard drive industry for additional discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

environmental regulation 

 

we are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with our operations we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations for additional discussion of risks related to environmental regulation see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

employees 

 

as of july 2 2010 we employed a total of approximately 62500 employees worldwide this represents an increase in headcount of approximately 36 since july 3 2009 and an increase of approximately 25 since june 27 2008 many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors we and most of our competitors nevertheless have difficulty at times hiring and retaining certain skilled employees we have engaged consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited we consider our employee relations to be good for additional discussion of risks related to our skilled employees see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

negative or uncertain global economic conditions could result in a decrease in our sales and revenue and an increase in our operating costs which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

negative or uncertain global economic conditions could cause many of our direct and indirect customers to delay or reduce their purchases of our products and systems containing our products in addition many of our customers in each of the oem distribution and retail channels rely on credit financing in order to purchase our products if negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit product orders in these channels may decrease which could result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses they may be unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these actions could result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

if industry demand slows significantly as a result of negative or uncertain global economic conditions or otherwise we may have to take steps to align our cost structure with demand which could result in impairment charges and have a negative impact on our operating results 

 

if demand slows significantly as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions or otherwise we may need to execute restructuring activities to realign our cost structure with softening demand the occurrence of restructuring activities could result in impairment charges and other expenses which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 

 

negative or uncertain global economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers’ accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial results 

 

we extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers in addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition we traditionally seek to mitigate our credit risk by purchasing credit insurance on certain of our accounts receivable balances however as a result of the recent uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions we may find it increasingly difficult to be able to insure these accounts receivable we could suffer significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we have not insured or have underinsured fails and is unable to pay us 

additionally negative or uncertain global economic conditions increase the risk that if a customer whose accounts receivable we have insured fails the financial condition of the insurance carrier for such customer account may have also deteriorated such that it cannot cover our loss a significant loss of an accounts receivable that we cannot recover through credit insurance would have a negative impact on our financial results 

 

if our longlived assets or goodwill become impaired it may adversely affect our operating results 

 

negative or uncertain global economic conditions could result in circumstances such as a sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a decrease in our forecasted cash flows such that they are insufficient indicating that the carrying value of our longlived assets or goodwill may be impaired if we are required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of our longlived assets or goodwill is determined our results of operations will be adversely affected 

 

declines in average selling prices “asps” in the hard drive industry could adversely affect our operating results 

 

historically the hard drive industry has experienced declining asps our asps tend to decline when competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share our asps also decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products when asps in the hard drive industry decline our asps are also likely to decline which adversely affects our operating results 

 

if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets for hard drives our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

the pc industry which comprises a substantial portion of our revenue is experiencing a shift in demand from 35inch to 25inch form factor disk drives as a result the market for 25inch form factor drives is becoming increasingly dominated by large brand oem customers these oem customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale if we are not successful in responding to these changes in the market for smaller form factor drives our business may suffer 

 

in addition during past economic downturns as well as over the past few years the consumer market for computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems and we therefore expect this trend to continue in light of current global economic conditions if we are not able to continue to offer a competitively priced hard drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results 

 

the market for hard drives is also fragmenting into a variety of devices and products many industry analysts expect as do we that as content increasingly converts to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue to converge and hard drives may be found in many products other than computers such as various ce devices however there has also been a recent rapid growth in ce devices that do not contain a hard drive such as tablet computers and smartphones if devicemakers are successful in achieving customer acceptance of these devices as a replacement for traditional computing applications that contain hard drives or if we are not successful in adapting our product offerings to include alternative storage solutions that address these devices then demand for our products may decrease which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

moreover some devices such as personal video recorders and digital video recorders or some new pc operating systems which allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality and therefore greater market differentiation may require attributes not currently offered in our products resulting in a need to develop new interfaces form factors technical specifications or product features increasing our overall operational expense without corresponding incremental revenue at this stage if we are not successful in continuing to deploy our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for emerging markets such as the ce market or if we are required to incur significant costs in developing such products it may harm our operating results 

 

our prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable enduser demand and oversupply of hard drives 

 

demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect 

on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price competition if intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenue and gross margins 

 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products accurately forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers in light of the volatility in global economic conditions the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts if our forecasts exceed actual market demand or if market demand decreases significantly from our forecasts then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if our forecasts do not meet actual market demand or if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

 

although we receive forecasts from our customers they are not generally obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts sales volumes in the distribution and retail channels are volatile and harder to predict than sales to our oem or odm customers we consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and our inventory requirements if we fail to accurately forecast our customers’ product demands we may have inadequate or excess inventory of our products or components which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

in order to efficiently and timely meet the demands of many of our oem customers we position our products in multiple strategic locations based on the amounts forecasted by such customers if an oem customer’s actual product demands decrease significantly from its forecast then we may incur additional costs in relocating the products that have not been purchased by the oem this could result in a delay in our product sales and an increase in our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

our entry into additional storage markets increases the complexity of our business and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes as required by these new markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

 

as we expand our product line to sell into additional storage markets the overall complexity of our business increases at an accelerated rate and we must make necessary adaptations to our business model to address these complexities for example as we have previously disclosed we entered the traditional enterprise market in november 2009 in addition to requiring significant capital expenditures our entry into the traditional enterprise market adds complexity to our business that requires us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and different requirements of the traditional enterprise market while maintaining a competitive operating cost model if we fail to gain market acceptance in the traditional enterprise storage market we will remain at a competitive disadvantage to the companies that succeed in this market and our ability to continue our growth will be negatively affected 

 

our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates which may lower the prices our customers are willing to pay for new products or put us at a disadvantage to competing technologies 

 

our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result of developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management the emergence of processes such as cloud computing data deduplication and storage virtualization or otherwise these factors could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products that we do not offer thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results 

expansion into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we do not successfully expand into new markets our business may suffer 

 

to remain a significant supplier of hard drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch or 25inch hard drives for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets however demand for hard drives may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer but which we do not expansion into other hard drive markets and resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may require us to make substantial additional investments in part because our operations are largely vertically integrated now that we manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture if we fail to successfully expand into new hard drive markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products 

 

if we fail to successfully manage our new product development or new market expansion or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with such development or expansion our business may suffer 

 

while we continue to develop new products and look to expand into new markets the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of factors including our ability to anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated with these new products and new markets such as 

 

  

further we need to identify how any of the new markets into which we are expanding may have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently exist and properly address these differences these characteristics may include 

 

  

our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with our product development and market expansion for example our branded products are designed to attach to and interoperate with a wide variety of pc and ce devices and therefore their functionality relies on the manufacturer of such devices or the associated operating systems enabling the manufacturer’s devices to operate with our branded products if our branded products are not compatible with a wide variety of devices or if device manufacturers design their devices so that our branded products cannot operate with them and we cannot quickly and efficiently adapt our branded products to address these compatibility issues our business could suffer 

 

expanding into new markets exposes our business to different seasonal demand cycles which in turn could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the ce and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and volume demand cycles as compared to the pc market by expanding into these markets we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations that are different from and in addition to those of the pc market for example because the primary customer for our branded products are individual consumers this market has historically experienced a dramatic increase in demand during the winter holiday season if we do not 

properly adjust our supply to these new demand cycles we risk having excess inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient inventory during periods of high demand which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if consumer spending decreases or if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results if consumer spending decreases as a result of the recent uncertainty and volatility in global economic conditions our operating results could suffer because of the increased importance of our branded products business 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores and ce stores and authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and online resellers our current retail customer base is primarily in the us canada and europe we are facing increased competition from other companies for shelf space at a small number of major retailers that have strong buying power and pricing leverage if we are unable to maintain effective working relationships with major retailers and online resellers or if we fail to successfully expand into multiple channels our competitive position in the branded product market may suffer and our operating results may be adversely affected 

 

our success in the retail market also depends on our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product quality issues even if false or unfounded could tarnish our reputation and cause our customers to choose products offered by our competitors in addition the proliferation of new methods of mass communication facilitated by the internet makes it easier for false or unfounded allegations to adversely affect our brand image and reputation if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd ®  brand products our operating results may be adversely affected 

 

additionally we face strong competition in maintaining and trying to grow our market share in the retail market particularly because of the relatively low barriers to entry in this market for example several additional hard drive manufacturers have recently disclosed plans to expand into the external storage market as these companies attempt to gain market share we may have difficulty in maintaining or growing our market share and there may be increased downward pressure on pricing there can be no assurance that any new products we introduce into the retail market will gain market acceptance and if they do not our operating results could suffer 

 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

 

during the year ended july 2 2010 a large percentage of our revenue 53 came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer is not generally obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and may be able to cancel an order or terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain these advantages 

 

further industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

 

the hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage additionally continued industry consolidation may lead to uncertainty in areas such as component availability which could negatively impact our cost structure 

 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken our operating results could suffer 

 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product if we fail to remain competitive in terms of our technology quality service and support our distribution customers may favor our competitors and our operating results could suffer additionally if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference or if we experience significant price declines due to oversupply in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

the hard drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by significant shifts in market share among the major competitors 

 

the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors taken together may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants in addition product recalls can lead to a loss of market share which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard drive industry may over extended periods of time sell hard drives at prices that we cannot profitably match 

 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to achieve profitability they may sell hard drives at lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonhard drive products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their hard drives at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers or if product life cycles lengthen it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an 

opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures 

 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls or epidemic failures and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated 

 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our hard drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product moreover there is a risk that product defects may trigger an epidemic failure clause in a customer agreement if an epidemic failure occurs we may be required to replace or refund the value of the defective product and to cover certain other costs associated with the consequences of the epidemic failure in addition a product recall or epidemic failure may damage our reputation or customer relationships and may cause us to lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products whether as a result of a product recall epidemic failure or otherwise if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 

a competitive cost structure is critical to our operating results and increased costs may adversely affect our operating margin 

 

a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is critical to the success of our business and our operating results depend on our ability to maintain competitive cost structures on new and established products if our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost structure that we are unable to match we could be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors 

 

shortages of commodity materials or commodity components price volatility or use by other industries of materials and components used in the hard drive industry may negatively impact our operating results 

 

increases in the cost for certain commodity materials or commodity components may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives and key components shortages of commodity components such as dram and nand flash or commodity materials such as glass substrates stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium or platinum may increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials or components such as these our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins in addition shortages in other commodity components and materials used in our customers’ products could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would negatively impact our operating results the volatility in the cost of oil also affects our transportation costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs through to our customers 

 

if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our major component suppliers our supply of critical components may be at risk and our profitability could suffer 

 

while we make most of our own heads and magnetic media for some of our product families we do according to our sourcing strategy purchase some percentage of our required heads and magnetic media from our external supply base in addition we purchase a majority of our other components including all mechanical and electronic components from our external supply base for certain components we use multiple suppliers that deploy different technology or processes and we must successfully integrate components from these suppliers in our products accordingly we must maintain effective relationships with our supply base to source our component needs develop compatible technology and maintain continuity of supply at reasonable costs if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our supply base or if we fail to 

integrate components from our suppliers effectively this may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver the best products to our customers and our profitability could suffer for example in august 2003 we settled litigation with a supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard drives as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our profitability was at risk until another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

 

violation of applicable laws including labor or environmental laws and certain other practices by our suppliers could harm our business 

 

we expect our suppliers subsuppliers and subcontractors collectively referred to as “suppliers” to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or divergence of a supplier’s business practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us could harm our business by 

 

  

dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays lost revenue or increased costs 

 

our future operating results may depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines in addition some of the components or component types used in our products are used in other devices such as mobile telephones and digital cameras if there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component or component type from several high volume industries resulting in a supply reduction if a component is otherwise in short supply or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic components or other necessary components we may experience production delays which could cause us loss of revenue if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

in addition certain equipment and consumables we use in our manufacturing or testing processes are available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment and consumables use materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

each of the following could also significantly harm our operating results 

 

 24 

 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of the current global economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

 

failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components technology or production equipment for our products may adversely affect our operations 

 

we rely on suppliers for various component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves such as semiconductors motors flex circuits and suspensions likewise we rely on suppliers for certain technology and equipment necessary for advanced development technology for future products some of these components and most of this technology and production equipment must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of with whom we are sole sourced we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated with our products and technology and production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently the failure of these suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components that can be integrated into our products or technology and production equipment that can be used to develop or manufacture next generation products may cause us to experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment of hard drive products our expansion into new technology and markets or our ability to remain competitive with alternative storage technologies therefore adversely affecting our business and financial results 

 

there are certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy to vertically integrate our operations 

 

our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing resulted in a fundamental change in our operating structure as we now manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture consequently we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if the overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves 

 

in addition we may incur additional risks including 

 

 25 

 

  

if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

 

if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

under our business plan we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in the hard drive products we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture in addition we may not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs which would negatively impact our business and financial results 

 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to increase areal density we may fail to remain competitive 

 

new products in the hard drive market typically require higher areal densities than previous product generations posing formidable technical and manufacturing challenges higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technologies developed to accommodate more data on a single disk in addition our introduction of new products during a technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns our failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results 

 

we make significant investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

over the past several years our business strategy has been to derive a competitive advantage by moving from being a follower of new technologies to being a leader in the innovation and development of new technologies this strategy requires us to make significant investments in research and development there can be no assurance that these investments will result in viable technologies or products or if these investments do result in viable technologies or products that they will be profitable or accepted by the market significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane giant magnetoresistance shingle magnetic 

recording energy assisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media advanced signal processing advanced format technology and other similar potentially breakthrough technologies that will represent revolutionary recording technologies if they can be implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry which could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads magnetic media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire for example new recording technology requires changes in the manufacturing process of heads and magnetic media which may cause longer production times and reduce the overall availability of magnetic media in the industry additionally the new technology requires a greater degree of integration between heads and magnetic media which may lengthen our time of development of hard drives using this technology 

 

furthermore as we attempt to develop and implement new technologies we may become more dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components technology and production equipment that accommodate the new technology for example advanced wafer and magnetic media manufacturing technologies have historically been developed for use in the semiconductor industry prior to the hard drive industry however successful implementation of the use of patterned magnetic media with hard drive magnetic media currently presents a significant technical challenge facing the hard drive industry but not the semiconductor industry therefore our suppliers may not be willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop manufacturing equipment for patterned magnetic media prior to a need for the equipment in the semiconductor industry we believe that if new technologies such as energy assisted magnetic recording are not successfully implemented in the hard drive industry then alternative storage technologies like solidstate storage may more rapidly overtake hard drives as the preferred storage solution for higher capacity storage needs this result would put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our operating results 

 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however because increasing areal density has become more difficult in the hard drive industry such increases may require increases in component costs and other opportunities to reduce costs may not continue at historical rates additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gb per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we do not properly manage the technology transitions of our products our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner for example serial interfaces normally go through cycles in which their maximum speeds double we must effectively manage the transition of the features of our products to address these faster interface speeds in a timely manner in order to remain competitive and cost effective if we fail to successfully and timely manage the transition to faster interface speeds we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other companies that have successfully adapted their products in a timely manner and our operating results may suffer 

 

if we fail to develop and introduce new hard drives that are competitive against alternative storage technologies our business may suffer 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with competing technologies alternative storage technologies like solidstate storage and flash memory technology have successfully served digital entertainment markets for products such as digital cameras mp3 players usb flash drives and mobile phones that require a relatively low amount of storage capacity that cannot be economically 

serviced using hard drive technology typically storage needs for higher capacity and performance with lower costpergigabyte have been better served by hard drives however advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in solidstate storage emerging as a technology that is competitive with hard drives for niche high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers and storage in spite of the associated challenges in the attributes of cost capacity and reliability solidstate storage which incorporates semiconductor media is produced by large semiconductor companies who can then sell their storage products at lower prices while still remaining profitable overall this can help them improve their market share at the expense of the competition in addition these semiconductor companies may choose to supply companies like us with semiconductor media at prices that make it difficult if not impossible for us to compete with them on a profitable basis as a result there can be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and developing new products for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets in response to solidstate storage as well as other competing technologies if our hard drive technology fails to offer higher capacity performance and reliability with lower costpergigabyte than solidstate storage for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology to serve these markets and our business will suffer 

 

spending to improve our technology and develop new technology to remain competitive may negatively impact our financial results 

 

in attempting to remain competitive we may need to increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model in order to attempt to improve our existing technology and develop new technology increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

 

our manufacturing operations are concentrated in a small number of large purposebuilt facilities which subjects us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

 

as a result of our cost structure and strategy of vertical integration we conduct our manufacturing operations at large high volume purposebuilt facilities for example approximately 80 of our requirement for heads is satisfied by wafers fabricated in our fremont california facility also we manufacture the majority of our substrates for magnetic media in our johor malaysia facility and we finish a majority of our magnetic media in our facilities in penang malaysia and tuas singapore a majority of our high volume hard drive manufacturing operations are conducted in two facilities in thailand with the balance conducted in our kuala lumpur malaysia facility the manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers are also in asia near our facilities a fire flood earthquake tsunami or other disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities would significantly affect our ability to manufacture hard drives which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results similarly a localized health risk affecting our employees at these facilities or the staff of our suppliers such as the spread of the influenza a h1n1 or a new pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture which would result in substantial harm to our operating results 

 

our operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to optimize the overall quality timetomarket and timetovolume of new and established products 

 

to achieve consistent success with our customers we must balance several key attributes such as timetomarket timetovolume quality cost service price and a broad product portfolio our operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to 

 

 28 

 

  

manufacturing outside the us and marketing our products globally subjects us to numerous risks 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our global manufacturing operations and global marketing efforts including 

 

  

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

 

we generally ship our products to our customers and receive shipments from our suppliers via air or ocean freight the sudden unavailability or disruption of cargo operations or freight lanes such as due to labor difficulties or disputes severe weather patterns or other natural disasters or political instability or civil unrest could impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products 

 

we are vulnerable to system failures or attacks which could harm our business 

 

we are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure among other functions to operate our factories sell our products fulfill orders manage inventory and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events our business is also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our business which could harm our reputation and financial condition 

if we fail to identify manage complete and integrate acquisitions investment opportunities or other significant transactions it may adversely affect our future results 

 

as part of our growth strategy we may pursue acquisitions of investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to our business in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities successfully complete the transaction some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees we may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions even if we identify and complete suitable corporate transactions we may not be able to successfully address any integration challenges in a timely manner or at all if we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our future results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

if we are unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our business results may suffer 

 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace global competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as well as attract integrate and retain new skilled employees volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted by global economic conditions we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 

 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information 

however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

 

the costs of compliance with state federal and international legal and regulatory requirements such as environmental labor trade and tax regulations and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs 

 

we may be or become subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing our environmental labor trade and tax practices these laws and regulations particularly those applicable to our international operations are or may be complex extensive and subject to change we will need to ensure that we and our component suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations which may result in an increase in our operating costs for example the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products in addition climate change legislation in the us is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal or other regulatory responses in the near future if we or our component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products or we may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes fines or penalties which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

 

because we manufacture and sell our products abroad our revenue margins operating costs and cash flows are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from japanese and other nonus based vendors if the us dollar continues to weaken against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin if this occurs it would have a negative impact on our operating results 

 

prices for our products are substantially us dollar denominated even when sold to customers that are located outside the us therefore as a substantial portion of our sales are from countries outside the us fluctuations in currency exchanges rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions and could adversely impact demand and revenue growth in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside the us 

 

we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm foreign exchange contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the counterparty if currency controls are put in place currently we hedge the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and british pound sterling with foreign exchange contracts 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs 

 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers with the most success in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly results 

 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

  

rapidly changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to predict actual results 

 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

 32 

 

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

current economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from financial institution failures 

 

the uncertain global economic conditions and volatile investment markets have caused us to hold more cash and cash equivalents than we would hold under normal circumstances since there has been an overall increase in demand for lowrisk us government backed securities with a limited supply in the financial marketplace we face increased difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and cash equivalents from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and other financial institutions a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could have an adverse impact on our financial position 

 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 

 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 2 2010 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods however if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in our financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price 

 

from time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results 

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities for example as we have previously disclosed we are under examination of certain of our fiscal years by the us internal revenue service the “irs” 

although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the outcomes and timing of these audits are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations net income or cash flows

results of operations 

 

fiscal 2010 overview 

 

in 2010 our net revenue increased by 32 to 98 billion on hard drive shipments of 194 million units as compared to 75 billion and 146 million units respectively in 2009 in 2010 64 of our hard drive net revenue was derived from nondesktop markets including notebook computers ce products enterprise applications and wdbranded product sales as compared to 62 in 2009 hard drive average selling price “asp” decreased to 50 in 2010 from 51 in 2009 gross margin percentage increased to 244 in 2010 from 179 in 2009 operating income increased by 10 billion to 15 billion in 2010 operating income was 519 million in 2009 which included a 14 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of siliconsystems inc “siliconsystems” 112 million of restructuring charges and an 18 million gain on the sale of assets from our substrate manufacturing facility in sarawak malaysia as a percentage of net revenue operating income was 155 in 2010 compared to 70 in 2009 net income in 2010 was 14 billion or 593 per diluted share compared to 470 million or 208 per diluted share in 2009 

 

on june 30 2010 we acquired the facilities equipment intellectual property and working capital of the magnetic media sputtering operations of hoya corporation and hoya magnetics singapore pte ltd “hoya” the acquisition is intended to augment our existing magnetic media operations strengthening our ability to meet anticipated growth in demand for hard drives the cost of the acquisition was approximately 233 million and was funded with available cash 

 

for the september quarter we expect our revenue to be relatively flat with the june quarter as a result of lower than historical demand growth rates and competitive pricing conditions

the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue in millions except percentages

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us “us gaap” operating results for hoya siliconsystems and komag incorporated “komag” which were acquired on june 30 2010 march 27 2009 and september 5 2007 respectively prior to the dates of their acquisitions are not included in our operating results 

 

fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

 

net revenue net revenue was 98 billion for 2010 an increase of 32 from 2009 total hard drive shipments increased to 194 million units as compared to 146 million units for the prior year the increase in net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in unit shipments due to the strong demand for hard drives particularly in the mobile pc market we shipped 80 million mobile drives in 2010 as compared to 55 million units in 2009 the increase in mobile 

unit shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and netbook pc demand coupled with increased customer preference for our product offerings 

 

changes in revenue by geography generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as well as demand strength in asia which continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region changes in revenue by channel are a result of normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2010 these programs represented 8 of gross revenues compared to 11 in 2009 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2010 was 24 billion an increase of 11 billion or 80 over the prior year gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 244 in 2010 from 179 in 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher volume lower costs a favorable product mix and a moderate pricing environment 

 

operating expenses total research and development “rd” expense and selling general and administrative “sga” expense decreased to 89 of net revenue in 2010 compared to 95 in 2009 rd expense was 611 million in 2010 an increase of 102 million or 20 over the prior year this increase in rd expense was primarily due to a 68 million increase relating to product development to support new programs and a 34 million increase in variable incentive compensation as a percentage of net revenue rd expense decreased to 62 in 2010 compared to 68 in 2009 primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 sga expense was 265 million in 2010 an increase of 64 million or 32 as compared to 2009 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to 27 million of expense related to litigation settlements a 19 million increase in variable incentive compensation and an 18 million increase in the expansion of our sales and marketing presence into new regions sga expense as a percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 27 in 2010 and 2009 

 

during 2009 we recorded a 14 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of siliconsystems this charge relates to projects that were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use and therefore the fair value of the development effort did not qualify for capitalization and was immediately expensed during 2009 we also recorded 112 million in restructuring charges and an 18 million gain on the sale of our substrate manufacturing facility and related assets in sarawak malaysia 

 

other income expense other expense net was 5 million in 2010 compared to 18 million in 2009 this decrease was primarily due to no impairment charges related to our auctionrate securities in 2010 compared to 10 million in otherthantemporary losses in 2009 as well as decreases in the variable interest rate on a lower amount of debt 

 

income tax provision income tax expense was 138 million in 2010 as compared to 31 million in 2009 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 9 in 2010 compared to 6 for 2009 in 2009 income tax expense included a provision of 42 million offset by 6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the us federal research and development tax credit enacted into law in october 2008 and a favorable adjustment of 5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various dates through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

 

we recognized a net 94 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2010 as of july 2 2010 we had approximately 230 million of unrecognized tax benefits which if recognized would decrease the effective tax rate in subsequent years 

 

fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 

 

net revenue net revenue was 75 billion for 2009 a decrease of 8 from 2008 total unit shipments of hard drives increased to 146 million as compared to 133 million for the prior year the decrease in revenue primarily resulted from a decline in our asps which reflected a more competitive pricing environment particularly in the notebook and 

branded markets the decline in our asps was partially offset by an increase in unit shipments of mobile drives we shipped 56 million mobile drives in 2009 as compared to 37 million units in 2008 the increase in mobile unit shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and netbook pc demand coupled with increased customer preference for our product offerings 

 

changes in revenue by geography and by channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as well as demand strength in asia which continued to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of mobile hard drives to oems 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2009 these programs represented 11 of gross revenues compared to 10 in 2008 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2009 was 13 billion a decrease of 402 million or 23 over the prior year gross margin percentage decreased to 179 in 2009 from 215 in 2008 this decrease is due to a more competitive pricing environment primarily resulting from an increase in product offerings in the mobile and branded markets 

 

operating expenses total rd expense and sga expense increased to 95 of net revenue in 2009 compared to 85 in 2008 rd expense was 509 million in 2009 an increase of 45 million or 10 over the prior year this increase in rd expense includes 76 million relating to product development to support new programs offset by a 31 million decrease in variable incentive compensation as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 68 in 2009 compared to 57 in 2008 primarily due to continued investment in product development sga expense was 201 million in 2009 a decrease of 19 million or 86 as compared to 2008 this decrease in sga expense primarily resulted from a 19 million decrease in variable incentive compensation and a 6 million insurance recovery offset by a 6 million net increase in the expansion of our sales and marketing presence into new regions sga expense was 27 as a percentage of net revenue in both 2009 and 2008 

 

during 2009 we recorded a 14 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of siliconsystems during 2008 we recorded a 49 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of komag these charges relate to projects that were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use and therefore the fair value of the development effort did not quality for capitalization and was immediately expensed during 2009 we also recorded 112 million in restructuring charges and an 18 million gain on the sale of our substrate manufacturing facility and related assets in sarawak malaysia 

 

other income expense net interest and other expense was 18 million in 2009 compared to 25 million in 2008 this change was primarily due to a decrease in the variable interest rate on our debt and a 3 million decrease in losses on our auctionrate securities 

 

income tax provision income tax expense was 31 million in 2009 compared to 114 million in 2008 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 6 in 2009 compared to 12 for 2008 in 2009 income tax expense included a provision of 42 million offset by 6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the us federal research and development tax credit enacted into law in october 2008 and a favorable adjustment of 5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits in 2008 tax expense included net charges of 60 million for taxes incurred upon the license of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary in our first fiscal quarter differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various dates through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax credits 

 

we recognized a 29 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2009 as of july 3 2009 we had approximately 136 million of unrecognized tax benefits which if recognized would decrease the effective tax rate in subsequent years 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we ended 2010 with total cash and cash equivalents of 27 billion an increase of 940 million from july 3 2009 the following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended july 2 2010 

 

 

 

our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through the foreseeable future our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was 19 billion as compared to 13 billion for 2009 and 14 billion for 2008 cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash used to fund working capital was 37 million for 2010 as compared to net cash provided by working capital changes of 198 million for 2009 and 22 million for 2008 

 

our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the average quarterly cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

for 2010 our average days sales outstanding “dsos” decreased by 1 day days in inventory “dios” decreased by 3 days and days payables outstanding “dpos” increased by 5 days the decreases in average dsos and dios were primarily the result of the strong demand environment that existed during the first three quarters of 2010 which led to better sales linearity and faster inventory turns during the corresponding period dsos and dios for the fourth quarter were 48 and 28 respectively changes in dpos are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities for 2010 was 986 million as compared to 551 million for 2009 and 13 billion for 2008 during 2010 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 737 million for capital expenditures 233 million used for the acquisition of the magnetic media sputtering operations of hoya and 20 million 

used for the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility during 2009 cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of 519 million for capital expenditures and 63 million for the acquisition of siliconsystems net of cash acquired partially offset by 29 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment during 2008 cash used in investing activities consisted of 927 million for the acquisition of komag net of cash acquired and 615 million for capital expenditures partially offset by net cash provided by shortterm investment activity of 221 million capital expenditures in 2010 primarily consisted of the expansion of our head wafer fabrication facilities continued investment in advanced head technologies and increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio 

 

for fiscal 2011 we expect capital expenditures to be between 7 and 8 of revenue plus approximately 200 million related to the conversion of our head wafer fabrication facilities to utilize 8inch wafers from 6inch wafers and expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired magnetic media sputtering operations we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 650 million for fiscal 2011 

 

our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market funds which are invested in us treasury securities us treasury bills and us government agency securities we also have auctionrate securities that are classified as longterm investments as they are expected to be held until secondary markets become available these investments are currently accounted for as availableforsale securities and recorded at fair value within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet the estimated market values of these investments are subject to fluctuation during the year ended july 2 2010 we sold 3 million of auctionrate securities reducing the carrying value of these investments to 15 million 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used by financing activities for 2010 was 16 million as compared to 64 million for 2009 net cash provided by financing activities was 326 million for 2008 net cash used by financing activities in 2010 consisted of 82 million used to repay longterm debt partially offset by a net 66 million provided by employee stock plans net cash used by financing activities in 2009 consisted of 36 million used to repurchase our common stock 27 million used to repay longterm debt and a net 1 million used by employee stock plans net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 consisted of 500 million in net proceeds from debt and a net 149 million provided by employee stock plans offset by a 250 million repayment of convertible debentures assumed in the acquisition of komag 60 million used to repurchase our common stock and 13 million used to repay other longterm debt

in february 2008 western digital technologies inc “wdti” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company entered into a fiveyear credit agreement that provided for a 500 million term loan facility as of july 2 2010 the remaining balance of the term loan facility was 400 million which requires principal payments totaling 106 million in 2011 144 million in 2012 and 150 million in 2013 see part ii item 8 note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

purchase orders 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment 

 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers which contain minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to these commitments 

 

foreign exchange contracts 

 

we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

indemnifications 

 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

unrecognized tax benefits 

 

as of july 2 2010 our total cash liability representing unrecognized tax benefits was 135 million we estimate the timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within the next two to five years see part ii item 8 note 9 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

our board of directors previously authorized us to repurchase 750 million of our common stock in open market transactions under a stock repurchase program through march 31 2013 since the inception of this program in 2005 through july 2 2010 we have repurchased 18 million shares for a total cost of 284 million we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow we did not make any repurchases of common stock under the authorized stock repurchase program during 2010 subsequent to july 2 2010 through august 13 2010 we repurchased 18 million shares for a total cost of 50 million 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

 

revenue and accounts receivable 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide distributors and retailers collectively referred to as “resellers” with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and we provide resellers and oems with other sales incentive programs at the time we recognize revenue to resellers and oems we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period resellers’ sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information and customer claim processing if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differ from our expectations our operating results could be materially affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product since 2008 total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 7 to 12 of gross revenues per quarter changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 01 of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could materially affect operating results 

 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could materially affect operating results 

warranty 

 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

inventory 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value we use the firstin firstout method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories while we use the weightedaverage method to value precious metal inventories weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production the weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a firstin firstout method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results 

 

litigation and other contingencies 

 

we disclose material contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when in consultation with our legal advisors we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss “nol” and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the 

morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefit in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previouslyrecorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for all stockbased compensation at fair value stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan “espp” purchase rights are estimated using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standard codification “asc” 820 “fair value measurements and disclosures” “asc 820” which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurement in february 2008 fasb issued asc 82010651 “fair value measurements and disclosures — transition and open effective date information” which delayed the effective date of asc 820 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those years which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010 our adoption of the provisions of asc 820 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued asc 805 “business combinations” “asc 805” asc 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree asc 805 also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination asc 805 applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010 asc 805 impacted our consolidated financial statements for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for business combinations in which the acquisition date was before the adoption date the provision of asc 805 requires changes in the amount of income tax uncertainties to be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the accounting for prior business combinations our adoption of asc 805 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in april 2008 the fasb issued asc 35030651 “general intangibles other than goodwill — transition and open effective date information” “asc 35030651” which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under asc 350 “intangibles — goodwill and other” asc 35030651 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010 our adoption of asc 35030651 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2009 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 200913 “multipledeliverable revenue arrangements” “asu 200913” and asu 200914 “certain revenue arrangements that include software elements” “asu 200914” asu 200913 amends the revenue guidance under subtopic 60525 “multiple element arrangements” and addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration shall be measured and allocated to the separate units of 

accounting in the arrangement asu 200914 excludes tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality from the scope of subtopic 985605 “revenue recognition” asu 200913 and asu 200914 are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after june 15 2010 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact that asu 200913 and asu 200914 will have on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets revenue liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase forward exchange contracts for trading purposes currently we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and british pound sterling malaysian ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges euro and british pound sterling contracts are designated as fair value hedges thai baht contracts are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

as of july 2 2010 we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

 

 

 

 

  

in 2010 2009 and 2008 total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

 

disclosure about other market risks 

 

variable interest rate risk 

 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of wdti either a a libor rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs the “eurocurrency rate” or b a base rate determined by reference to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 and ii the prime rate as announced by jpmorgan chase bank na the “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility ranges from 125 to 150 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis if the federal funds rate prime rate or libor rate increases our interest payments could also increase a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the credit facility would increase interest expense by approximately 4 million annually

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see page 53 herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended july 2 2010 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in a system of internal control over financial reporting no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving 

its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

general 

 

we design develop manufacture and sell hard drives a hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks “magnetic media” to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are key components of computers including desktop and notebook computers “pcs” data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic “ce” devices 

 

we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and original design manufacturers “odms” for use in computer systems subsystems or ce devices and to distributors resellers and retailers our hard drives are used in desktop computers notebook computers and enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage storage area networks and video surveillance equipment additionally our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” we also sell our hard drives as standalone storage products and integrate them into finished enclosures embedding application software and offering the products as wd ® branded external storage appliances for personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music photographs video and other digital data 

 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device our hard drives currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes “gb” to 2 terabytes “tb” nominal rotation speeds up to 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including both enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” and serial advanced technology attachment “sata” we also embed our hard drives into wd ® branded external storage appliances using interfaces such as usb 20 external sata firewire tm and ethernet network connections with capacities of 160 gb up to 8 tb in addition we offer a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives utilizing our wd greenpower technology tm  

 

in the second quarter of 2009 we began to design develop manufacture and sell media players a media player is a device that connects to a user’s television or home theater system and plays digital movies music and photos from any of our wd ® branded external hard drives or other usb mass storage devices we sell our media players worldwide to resellers and retailers under our wd ® brand 

 

in the third quarter of 2009 with the acquisition of siliconsystems inc “siliconsystems” we began to design develop manufacture and sell solidstate drives a solidstate drive is a storage device that uses semiconductor nonvolatile media rather than magnetic disks and magnetic heads to store and allow fast access to data we sell our solidstate drives worldwide to oems and distributors for use in the embedded systems market which includes networkcommunications industrial embeddedcomputing medical military aerospace mediaappliance and datastreaming applications 

 

business strategy 

 

our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of reliable high quality hard drives at a low total cost of ownership and with high efficiency and speed we believe this strategy helps accomplish the following 

 

  

we have designed our business strategy to accommodate significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high asset utilization 

industry 

 

we design develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop and mobile pc enterprise ce and branded product retail markets we believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has continued to outpace the growth in the sales of all pcs as there were approximately 84 more hard drives sold in the market than pcs in calendar 2008 based on industry data we believe the following factors continue to drive this accelerating growth of hard drive sales in addition to pc applications 

 

  

additionally we believe that the demand for 25inch hard drives has grown from approximately 16 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2003 to 41 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2008 driven by the fastgrowing markets for notebook and netbook computers game consoles and external storage 

 

we design develop and manufacture solidstate drives for the embedded systems market which includes networkcommunications industrial embeddedcomputing medical military aerospace media appliance and data streaming applications we believe that the growth rate of solidstate drives will be significant over the next four years with particular opportunities for growth in the enterprise storage netbooks and embedded systems markets 

 

we also design develop and manufacture wd ® branded media players for the retail market we believe there is a growing need for consumers to play their stored digital content on their television or home theater system in connection with the growing trend in the digitization of rich content and data 

 

these factors and our product expansion strategy have gradually increased our percentage of revenue derived from nondesktop sources in 2009 62 of our revenue was from nondesktop sources compared to 56 in 2008 

 

for an additional discussion of risks relating to the hard drive industry please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

desktop pc market 

 

the desktop pc market consists of the overall hard drive market for desktop computers individuals use desktop computers in homes businesses and multiuser networks desktop computers use software applications for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and for other needs hard drives store desktop computer operating system and application software as well as the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop pc market has grown in part due to 

 

  

we believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop computer unit growth including growth of notebook and netbook computers maturing desktop pc markets in north america and western europe an increase in firsttime buyers of desktop computers in asia eastern europe and latin america and the lengthening of desktop computer replacement cycles 

mobile pc market 

 

the mobile pc market consists primarily of notebook and netbook computers individuals use mobile computers both in and away from homes and businesses like desktop computers mobile computers use software applications for various needs and hard drives store notebook operating system and application software and the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile pc market has grown in part due to 

 

  

we expect the mobile pc market to continue to grow faster than the desktop or enterprise markets in the next three years as the mobile pc market continues to evolve to a higher volume market we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on attributes such as quality availability reliability execution flexibility capacity performance power and the competitive cost structures of their hard drive suppliers these are the same attributes that have been emphasized for many years by customers in the highvolume desktop pc market 

 

enterprise market 

 

the enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations servers network attached storage storage area networks other computing systems or subsystems and video surveillance historically hard drives for this market have utilized several interfaces including the small computer systems interface “scsi” and fibre channel arbitrated loop “fcal” beginning in 2003 these traditional enterprise interfaces have been supplemented or replaced in certain storage applications by hard drives featuring the serial attached scsi “sas” interface technology which is supported by industry standards as well as by sata sata hard drives typically cost customers less than scsi hard drives while offering higher capacities and maintaining similar reliability scalability and performance 

 

we believe that enterprise uses of sata hard drives will continue to increase during the past few years a new diskbased backup application has emerged with highcapacity sata hard drives augmenting scsi and sas hard drives tape and optical media this new application popularly referred to as “nearline” storage has created a growth market because hard drives back up or access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions and quickly retrieve critical backup or nearline data the availability of sata hard drive solutions which are more cost effective than scsi and sas hard drives promotes the increasing use of highcapacity hard drives in nearline storage applications the low price per capacity of sata drives has stimulated new applications such as video surveillance video editingbroadcasting and medical imaging these applications represent segments of a growing market for high capacity storage in noncomputing imaging and multimedia professions 

 

enterpriseclass sata drives are becoming commonplace for it infrastructure applications such as databases scientific computing web content web caching web search engines and electronic mail these applications have become an important market for highcapacity sata hard drives we believe that this market will consume a growing portion of the highest capacity hard drives in the next three years 

 

sas is the next generation scsi technology and has been replacing scsi drives over the past few years sata technology is compatible with sas technology enabling customers the flexibility of incorporating sata hard drives in sas storage systems we believe the market transition from scsi to sas has added to the growth of the enterpriseclass sata market which currently is estimated to be approximately 47 of the enterprise hard drive market 

 

highperformance server applications including blade servers are increasingly using 25inch form factor hard drives supplanting traditional 35inch drives smaller form factors enable more drives per physical space for increased 

performance higher capacity per square foot and lower power consumption this trend demonstrates the fragmentation of the enterprise hard drive market and the need for applicationspecific enterpriseclass hard drives 

 

consumer electronics market 

 

the use of hard drives in ce products has been a major growth area in recent years currently the three largest segments of this market are 

 

  

since 1999 dvrs have been available for use in home entertainment systems and they offer enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program additionally digital video disk “dvd” recorders increasingly incorporate hard drives to allow for dvr functionality and faster recording of content onto removable dvds the market for these products favors larger capacity hard drives and continues to grow in japan north america and europe additionally the rest of asia pacific shows strong interest in this market we believe growth in this market will continue to build demand for higher capacity hard drives 

 

the proliferation in the ce market of more sophisticated mobile devices including cell phones and mp3 players is driving the delivery of diverse content from hard drive intensive hosts we believe this is one of the factors influencing increased sales of enterpriseclass sata drives we also believe that multimedia handheld devices such as video cameras and highresolution still cameras are enabling consumer production of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of small formfactor hard drive storage as well as highcapacity desktopclass hard drives for editing manipulation and longterm storage of such content 

 

hard drives with 18inch or 10inch form factors primarily address the consumer handheld device and portable external storage markets the majority of hard drives used in portable media players that play both digital audio and video content are 18inch form factors currently we believe the markets for these handheld devices are better served by flash memory as opposed to rotating magnetic storage 

 

external hard drive market 

 

most new pc systems include highspeed external interfaces such as usb 20 external sata firewire tm or ethernet network connections that permit users to supplement the storage space of their pc systems or home and small office networks with the use of external hard drives users store additional programs or multimedia content and back up internal hard drives with external hard drives as well as mobile external hard drives for mobility convenience although external hard drives are a small part of the overall hard drive market we believe that sales of external hard drives will continue to grow external storage can often be the easiest quickest or only way of adding additional storage capacity to either a desktop or notebook computer we believe there is an increasing consumer awareness of the need and value of securely storing personal digital content through backup applications and devices in addition there is opportunity for external storage as a way of expanding storage capacity in ce devices such as dvrs we also believe there is a growing need for media players that enable consumers to play digital movies music and photos otherwise limited to being viewed on computer screens from usb mass storage devices on their television or home theater system 

 

solidstate drive market 

 

the solidstate drive market consists primarily of solidstate drives constructed with semiconductor nonvolatile media that retains data even when power is not applied using either singlelevel cell or multilevel cell nand media our solidstate drive products are currently used in the embedded systems market which includes networkcommunications industrial embeddedcomputing medical military aerospace media appliance and data streaming applications 

 

we believe that the demand for solidstate drives in certain markets has grown in part due to

we expect the solidstate drive market to grow faster on a compounded annual growth rate basis than the hard drive market over the next four years 

 

other market opportunities 

 

we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve based on significant investments we made over the last five years we believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market penetration and be a fullline hard drive supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the recent past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions

technology and product development 

 

hard drives record store and retrieve digital data performance attributes of hard drives such as their ability to access and transmit data and storage capacity are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical hard drives and tapes and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 

  

all of our hard drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” the hda includes heads magnetic media “disks” head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector 

 

hda one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the head stack assembly “hsa” is comprised of a magnetic positioner a pivotarm module on which the individual heads 

are mounted each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

 

pcba the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

 

industrystandard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interfaces for pcs are eide parallel advanced technology attachment or “pata” and sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are sata scsi sas and fcal as computer performance continues to improve the hard drive will need to deliver information faster we believe this will continue to drive the pc industry transition to higher speed interfaces such as sata and sas to facilitate the higher data transfer rates we currently offer the sata interface on our wd caviar ®  wd scorpio ® wd ® re wd velociraptor tm and wd ® av hard drive families and eide pata on wd caviar ®  wd scorpio ® and wd ® av families 

 

the number of disks and each disk’s areal density track density multiplied by bit density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk per unit area determines storage capacity of the hard drive the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter achieving a given drive capacity requires fewer disks and heads as the areal density increases potentially reducing product costs over time through reduced component requirements in january 2009 we began shipping our wd caviar ® 35inch family of drives at 500 gb per platter approximately 400 gigabits per square inch areal density in july 2009 we began shipping our wd scorpio ® blue tm 25inch 1 tb drives at 333 gb per platter approximately 525 gigabits per square inch areal density 

 

head technology is one of the key components affecting areal density historically there have been rapid technological changes resulting in several generations of head technology in a relatively short time however in recent years the time has lengthened between changes in generations of head technology the hard drive industry has transitioned from the use of longitudinal magnetic recording “lmr” head technology for the head writer function to perpendicular magnetic recording “pmr” technology which allows for significantly higher storage capacities in addition the industry has made the transition to tunneljunction magneto resistive “tmr” technology for the head reader function we have completed the transition to pmr and tmr across all of our product platforms 

 

with the transition to pmr magnetic media plays a much more important role in achieving higher areal density pmr demands a much tighter interaction and matching between head and magnetic media designs we are vertically integrated in the two most important technology components of hard drives heads and magnetic media which has enabled us to achieve a more optimum design and utilization of these components 

 

we invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and magnetic media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

 

solidstate drives record store and retrieve digital data without any moving parts attributes such as fast readwrite speeds low power consumption and robust durability offer greater performance than hard drives in some storage applications but are currently much more costly per gigabyte and are available in much lower capacity points than hard drives the main components of a solidstate drive are the systemonchip and semiconductor media the capacity measured in megabytes or gigabytes of a solidstate drive is based on the total number of megabits or gigabits of semiconductor media in the solidstate drive industrystandard storage interface protocols such as sata pataeidecf and usb 20 allow the solidstate drive to communicate with the host system 

 

the wd ® product lines generally leverage a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families and in some cases across product families which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models

sales and distribution 

 

we sell our products globally to oems odms distributors and retailers oems purchase our products either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an odm and assemble them into the computer or ce systems they build distributors typically sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers retailers typically sell our products directly to endusers through their storefront or online facilities 

 

original equipment manufacturers 

 

sales to oems which include sales through odms accounted for 54 51 and 48 of our net revenue in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively for 2009 and 2007 sales to dell inc accounted for 10 of our net revenue for 2008 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenue we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our strong relationships with the leading oems 

 

oems evaluate and select their hard drive and solidstate drive suppliers based on a number of factors including quality and reliability storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability they typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of products and once an oem has chosen its qualified vendors for a given product it generally will purchase products from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with oem qualifications a supplier must consistently offer products featuring leading technology quality and reliability at acceptable capacity suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of each new generation of high quality and reliable hard drives or solidstate drives requiring access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities 

 

many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” in which they do not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” in which the oem contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer such as an odm who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the oem’s instructions for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our need to adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

distributors 

 

we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors accounted for approximately 26 31 and 36 of our net revenue for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in those territories we grant our distributors limited price protection rights 

 

retailers 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers retailers accounted for approximately 20 18 and 16 of our net revenue for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our current retail customer base is primarily in the united states “us” canada and europe the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for wd and our products retailers supply endusers with our products to upgrade their computers externally store their data for backup or mobility purposes and play their stored digital content on their television or home theater systems we grant our retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis we also sell our branded products through our web site 

sales and marketing 

 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 80 76 and 68 of our net revenue for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for an additional discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international customers see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and major customer information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms we target advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and enduser categories we utilize both consumer media and trade publications we have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures we also maintain customer relationships by communicating with our resellers and providing endusers with information and support through our web site 

 

competition 

 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use in desktop notebook enterprise ce and external storage products our competitors in the hard drive market include companies such as fujitsu limited which has announced that the transfer of its hard drive business to toshiba has been delayed until september 2009 hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics co ltd seagate technology and toshiba corporation 

 

the hard drive industry is intensely competitive with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors 

 

we believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products therefore we believe that we cannot differentiate wd ® hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly we differentiate wd by focusing on operational excellence high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating into our hard drives desirable product performance attributes such performance attributes include seek times data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics error recovery low operating temperature low power consumption and optimized streaming capabilities 

 

in addition we differentiate wd by emphasizing nonproduct related attributes including rapid response to our customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction we also rely on the strength of the wd brand name with valueadded resellers retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive products directly and indirectly we believe that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation its execution track record and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard drive particularly in a rapidly changing technology environment 

 

advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis 

 

highspeed semiconductor media competes with hard drive products in some applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage semiconductor media is much faster in some applications than magnetic hard drives but currently is not competitive in most applications using 35inch and 25inch form factor hard drives 

from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor media is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance attributes than hard drives it has lower “write” performance attributes flash memory could become more competitive in the near future for additional applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives however we believe that the traditional highvolume computing markets will remain the domain of 35inch and 25inch hard drives based on the hard drive industry’s attributes of reliability availability and cost 

 

our competitors in the external hard drive market include companies such as emc corporation hitachi global storage technologies lacie group melco holdings inc and seagate technology our competitors in the solidstate drive market include companies such as intel corporation micron technology inc smart modular technologies inc stec inc and samsung electronics co ltd 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to competition see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

service and warranty 

 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured products against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions including africa asia pacific australia europe india latin america the middle east and north america to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned products for our customers in addition we receive and service returned hard drives at our us facility 

 

manufacturing 

 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and have the ability to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations to be competitive we must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components that we manufacture ourselves while insisting that our suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key supplier relationships by establishing close relationships with our strategic component suppliers we believe we access bestofclass technology and manufacturing quality in addition we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

 

hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

 

we manufacture hard drives in malaysia and thailand we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

 

we use our wafer fabrication facilities in fremont california and our slider fabrication facility in bang pain thailand to design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and head gimbal assemblies “hgas” we include in the hard drives we manufacture we have deferred the completion of converting our head wafer fabrication facilities in fremont california to utilize 8inch wafers from 6inch wafers as a result of macroeconomic conditions 

 

we also have magnetic media and substrate design and manufacturing facilities in malaysia we use these facilities to design and manufacture most of the magnetic media and substrates that we use in our products 

 

we leverage the efficiencies of contract manufacturers when strategically advantageous 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

materials and supplies 

 

the following products are the major components currently used in the manufacture of our hard drives 

 

  

we also use several other components in our hard drives such as seals filters plastic molded parts capacitors resistors connectors and cables 

 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads magnetic media and substrates required for the hard drives we manufacture we purchase a portion of these components from third party suppliers we acquire all of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers 

 

the major components used in the manufacture of our solidstate drives the semiconductor media and systemonchip and in our media player the controller are acquired from third party suppliers 

 

we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our component supplies see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

backlog 

 

a substantial portion of our orders are generally for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order we generally negotiate pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions before receiving a customer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition we make many of our sales to oems under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead we receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods 

 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

 

we own numerous patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the us 

 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell wd products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio 

to compete successfully in the hard drive industry for additional discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

environmental regulation 

 

we are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with our operations we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations for additional discussion of risks related to environmental regulation see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

employees 

 

as of july 3 2009 we employed a total of 45991 employees worldwide this represents a decrease in headcount of approximately 8 since june 27 2008 and an increase of approximately 56 since june 29 2007 many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors we and most of our competitors nevertheless have difficulty at times hiring and retaining certain skilled employees we have engaged consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited we consider our employee relations to be good for additional discussion of risks related to our skilled employees see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

negative worldwide economic conditions could continue to result in a decrease in our sales and revenue and an increase in our operating costs which could continue to adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

if the current worldwide economic downturn continues many of our direct and indirect customers may delay or reduce their purchases of our products and systems containing our products in addition many of our customers in each of the oem distribution and retail channels rely on credit financing in order to purchase our products if the negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit product orders in these channels may decrease which could result in lower revenue likewise if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products these actions could result in reductions in our revenue increased price competition and increased operating costs which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

negative worldwide economic conditions could prevent us from accurately forecasting demand for our products which could adversely affect our operating results or market share 

 

the current negative worldwide economic conditions and market instability make it increasingly difficult for us our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends which could cause us to produce excess products that can depress product prices increase our inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory alternatively this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products or materials used in our products that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share for a further discussion of these risks please see the risk factor below entitled “ our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies” 

 

negative global economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers’ accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial results 

 

we extend credit and payment terms to some of our customers in addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition we traditionally seek to mitigate our credit risk by purchasing credit insurance on certain of our accounts receivable balances however as a result of the current negative worldwide economic conditions we may find it increasingly difficult to be able to insure these accounts receivable we could suffer significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we have not insured or have underinsured fails and is unable to pay us additionally if global economic conditions worsen the risk increases that if a customer whose accounts receivable we have insured fails the financial condition of the insurance carrier for such customer account may have also deteriorated such that it cannot cover our loss a significant loss of an accounts receivable that we cannot recover through credit insurance would have a negative impact on our financial results 

if the worldwide economic downturn worsens we may have to take additional steps to align our cost structure with demand which could result in increased impairment charges and have a negative impact on our operating results 

 

as we previously announced we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to realign our cost structure with a softer demand environment if the worldwide economic downturn worsens and demand were to soften further we may be forced to execute additional restructuring activities to realign our cost structure with softening demand additional restructuring activities could result in impairment charges and other expenses in excess of what we anticipated when we previously announced our restructuring plan either of which could adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 

 

if our longlived assets or goodwill become impaired it may adversely affect our operating results 

 

if the current worldwide economic downturn continues it could result in circumstances such as a sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization or a decrease in our forecasted cash flows such that they are insufficient indicating that the carrying value of our longlived assets or goodwill may be impaired if we are required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of our longlived assets or goodwill is determined our results of operations will be adversely affected 

 

declines in average selling prices “asps” in the hard drive industry could adversely affect our operating results 

 

historically the hard drive industry has experienced declining asps our asps tend to decline when competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share our asps also decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products when asps in the hard drive industry decline our asps are also likely to decline which adversely affects our operating results 

 

if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets for hard drives our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

during past economic downturns as well as over the past few years the consumer market for computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems and we therefore expect this trend to continue in light of the current negative worldwide macroeconomic conditions if we are not able to continue to offer a competitively priced hard drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results the market for hard drives is also fragmenting into a variety of devices and products many industry analysts expect as do we that as content increasingly converts to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue to converge and hard drives may be found in many products other than computers such as various ce devices accurately forecasting for future requirements of these new markets remains challenging 

 

moreover some devices such as personal video recorders and digital video recorders or some new pc operating systems which allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality and therefore greater market differentiation may require attributes not currently offered in our products resulting in a need to develop new interfaces form factors technical specifications or product features increasing our overall operational expense without corresponding incremental revenue at this stage if we are not successful in continuing to deploy our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for emerging markets such as the ce market or if we are required to incur significant costs in developing such products it may harm our operating results 

 

our prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable enduser demand and oversupply of hard drives 

 

demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price competition if intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenue and gross margins 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies 

 

the data storage industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts if our forecasts exceed actual market demand or if market demand decreases significantly from our forecasts then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if our forecasts do not meet actual market demand or if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

 

although we receive forecasts from our customers they are not generally obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts sales volumes in the distribution and retail channels are volatile and harder to predict than sales to our oem or odm customers we consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and our inventory requirements if we fail to accurately forecast our customers’ product demands we may have inadequate or excess inventory of our products or components which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

in order to efficiently and timely meet the demands of many of our oem customers we position our products in multiple strategic locations based on the amounts forecasted by such customers if an oem customer’s actual product demands decrease significantly from its forecast then we may incur additional costs in relocating the products that have not been purchased by the oem this could result in a delay in our product sales and an increase in our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

increases in areal density may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity which may lower the prices our customers are willing to pay for new products or put us at a disadvantage to competing technologies 

 

historically the industry has experienced periods of variable areal density growth rates when the rate of areal density growth increases the rate of increase may exceed the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity furthermore our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result of developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management the emergence of processes such as cloud computing data deduplication and storage virtualization or otherwise these factors could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solidstate storage products that we do not offer thereby decreasing our revenue or putting us at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our entry into additional storage markets increases the complexity of our business and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes as required by these new markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage and our ability to grow will be adversely affected 

 

as we expand our product line to sell into additional storage markets the overall complexity of our business increases at an accelerated rate and we must make necessary adaptations to our business model to address these complexities for example as we have previously disclosed we have been investing in technology to develop and support a product line to sell to mainstream enterprise market customers in addition to requiring significant capital expenditures our entry into the mainstream enterprise market adds complexity to our business that requires us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and different requirements of the mainstream enterprise market while maintaining a competitive operating cost model if we fail or are delayed in our attempts to enter into the mainstream enterprise storage market we will remain at a competitive disadvantage to the companies that serve this market and our ability to continue our growth will be negatively affected 

 

expansion into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we do not successfully expand into new markets our business may suffer 

 

to remain a significant supplier of hard drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch or 25inch hard drives for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets however demand for hard drives may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that 

our competitors offer but which we do not expansion into other hard drive markets and resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may require us to make substantial additional investments in part because our operations are largely vertically integrated now that we manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture if we fail to successfully expand into new hard drive markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products 

 

if we fail to successfully manage our new product development or new market expansion or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with such development or expansion our business may suffer 

 

while we continue to develop new products and look to expand into new markets the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of factors including our ability to anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated with these new products and new markets such as 

 

  

further we need to identify how any of the new markets into which we are expanding may have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently exist and properly address these differences these characteristics may include 

 

  

our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with our product development and market expansion for example our branded products are designed to attach to and interoperate with a wide variety of pc and ce devices and therefore their functionality relies on the manufacturer of such devices or the associated operating systems enabling the manufacturer’s devices to operate with our branded products if our branded products are not compatible with a wide variety of devices or if device manufacturers design their devices so that our branded products cannot operate with them and we cannot quickly and efficiently adapt our branded products to address these compatibility issues our business could suffer 

 

expanding into new markets exposes our business to different seasonal demand cycles which in turn could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the ce and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and volume demand cycles as compared to the pc market by expanding into these markets we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations that are different from and in addition to those of the pc market for example because the primary customer for our branded products are individual consumers this market has historically experienced a dramatic increase in demand during the winter holiday season if we do not properly adjust our supply to these new demand cycles we risk having excess inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient inventory during periods of high demand which could adversely affect our operating results 

selling to the retail market is an important part of our business and if consumer spending continues to decrease or if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

 

selling branded products is an important part of our business and as our branded products revenue increases as a portion of our overall revenue our success in the retail market becomes increasingly important to our operating results if consumer spending continues to decrease as a result of the current worldwide economic downturn our operating results could suffer because of the increased importance of our branded products business 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores and ce stores and authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and online resellers our current retail customer base is primarily in the us canada and europe we are facing increased competition from other companies for shelf space at a small number of major retailers that have strong buying power and pricing leverage if we are unable to maintain effective working relationships with major retailers and online resellers our competitive position in the branded product market may suffer and our operating results may be adversely affected in addition if customers no longer maintain a preference for wd ®  brand products or if we fail to successfully expand into multiple channels our operating results may be adversely affected 

 

additionally we face strong competition in maintaining and trying to grow our market share in the retail market particularly because of the relatively low barriers to entry in this market for example several additional hard drive manufacturers have recently disclosed plans to expand into the external storage market and as these companies attempt to gain market share we may have difficulty in maintaining or growing our market share and there may be increased downward pressure on pricing we will continue to introduce new products in the retail market that incorporate our disk drives however there can be no assurance that these products will gain market acceptance and if they do not our operating results could suffer 

 

loss of market share with or by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base could harm our operating results 

 

during the year ended july 3 2009 a large percentage of our revenue 48 came from sales to our top 10 customers these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer is not generally obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and may be able to cancel an order or terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

additionally if there is consolidation among our customer base our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect our profitability in addition if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our products replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could harm our operating results 

 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes we may be at a competitive disadvantage to any companies that are able to gain these advantages 

further industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

 

the hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage additionally continued industry consolidation may lead to uncertainty in areas such as component availability which could negatively impact our cost structure 

 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken our operating results could suffer 

 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product if we fail to remain competitive in terms of our technology quality service and support our distribution customers may favor our competitors and our operating results could suffer we also face significant risk in the distribution market for hard drives if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference from white box to branded pcs or if we experience significant price declines due to oversupply in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

the hard drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by significant shifts in market share among the major competitors 

 

the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors taken together may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants in addition product recalls can lead to a loss of market share which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard drive industry may over extended periods of time sell hard drives at prices that we cannot profitably match 

 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to achieve profitability they may sell hard drives at lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss over an extended period of time while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonhard drive products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their hard drives at lower prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers or if product life cycles lengthen it may have a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins 

 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in delayed or reduced product sales reduced product margins caused by having to continue to offer a more costly current generation product or lost sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the storage markets likewise if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could reduce our profits because we expect declining gross margins on our current generation products as a result of competitive pressures 

 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability limitations 

 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our hard drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal latent 

defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product in addition a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 

a competitive cost structure is critical to our operating results and increased costs may adversely affect our operating margin 

 

a competitive cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is critical to the success of our business and our operating results depend on our ability to maintain competitive cost structures on new and established products if our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost structure that we are unable to match we could be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors 

 

shortages of commodity materials price volatility or use by other industries of materials used in the hard drive industry may increase our cost structure 

 

increases in the cost for certain commodity materials may increase our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives and key components shortages of materials such as stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium or platinum increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs for example perpendicular recording technology requires increased usage of precious metals such as ruthenium and platinum the price of which may continue to be volatile which could adversely affect our operating margins furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials such as these our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins the volatility in the cost of oil also affects our transportation costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs through to our customers 

 

if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our major component suppliers our supply of critical components may be at risk and our profitability could suffer 

 

we make most of our own heads and magnetic media for some of our product families however we do not manufacture many of the component parts used in our hard drives as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our major component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers each of which employs variations on technology which can impact for example feasible combinations of heads and magnetic media components for example in august 2003 we settled litigation with a supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard drives as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our profitability was at risk until another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

 

violation of labor or environmental laws and practices by our suppliers or subsuppliers could harm our business 

 

we expect our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or subsuppliers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or subsuppliers or divergence of a supplier’s or subsupplier’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us could harm our business by 

 

 23 

 

  

dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays lost revenue or increased costs 

 

certain components are available from a limited number of suppliers and we are sole sourced with some of these suppliers on certain products because we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain product components and manufacturing equipment each of the following could significantly harm our operating results 

 

  

if components and equipment that we use are available from only a limited number of suppliers or are in short supply it may negatively impact our production and cause us to lose revenue 

 

our future operating results may also depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines in addition some of the components or component types used in our products are used in other devices such as mobile telephones and digital cameras if there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component or component type from several high volume industries resulting in a supply reduction if a component is otherwise in short supply or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic components or other necessary components we may experience production delays which could cause us loss of revenue if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

in addition certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or testing processes is available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment uses materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components or may cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory 

 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components which may subject us to cancellation charges if we cancel orders as a result of technology transitions or changes in our component needs in addition we may from time to time enter into contractual commitments with component suppliers 

in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components furthermore as a result of the current negative worldwide economic conditions our ability to forecast our requirements for these components has become increasingly difficult therefore increasing the risk that our contractual commitments may not meet our actual supply requirements which could cause us to have inadequate or excess component inventory and adversely affect our operating results and increase our operating costs 

 

failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components technology or production equipment for our products may adversely affect our operations 

 

we rely on suppliers for various component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves such as semiconductors motors flex circuits and suspensions likewise we rely on suppliers for certain technology and equipment necessary for advanced development technology for future products some of these components and most of this technology and production equipment must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products or for developing and manufacturing our future products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers some of with whom we are sole sourced we are therefore dependent on these suppliers to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop components that can be successfully integrated with our products and technology and production equipment that can be used to develop and manufacture our nextgeneration products efficiently the failure of these suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components that can be integrated into our products or technology and production equipment that can be used to develop or manufacture next generation products may cause us to experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment of hard drive products our expansion into new technology and markets or our ability to remain competitive with alternative storage technologies therefore adversely affecting our business and financial results 

 

there are certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy to vertically integrate our operations 

 

our vertical integration of head and magnetic media manufacturing resulted in a fundamental change in our operating structure as we now manufacture heads and magnetic media for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture consequently we make more capital investments and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than we would if we were not vertically integrated if the overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or magnetic media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves 

 

in addition we may incur additional risks including 

 

  

if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or magnetic media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and magnetic media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

under our business plan we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media used in some of the hard drive products we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and magnetic media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and magnetic media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and magnetic media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or magnetic media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or magnetic media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or magnetic media we manufacture in addition we may not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs which would negatively impact our business and financial results 

 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to increase areal density we may fail to remain competitive 

 

new products in the hard drive market typically require higher areal densities than previous product generations posing formidable technical and manufacturing challenges higher areal densities require existing head and magnetic media technology to be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on a single disk in addition our introduction of new products during a technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns our failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results 

 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane “cpp” energy assisted magnetic recording patterned magnetic media and other similar potentially breakthrough technology that will represent revolutionary recording technologies if they can be implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry which could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads magnetic media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire for example new recording technology requires changes in the manufacturing process of heads and magnetic media which may cause longer production times and reduce the overall availability of magnetic media in the industry additionally the new technology requires a greater degree of integration between heads and magnetic media which may lengthen our time of development of hard drives using this technology 

 

furthermore as we attempt to develop and implement new technologies we may become more dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components technology and production equipment that accommodate the new technology for example advanced wafer and magnetic media manufacturing technologies have historically been developed for use in the semiconductor industry prior to the hard drive industry however successful implementation of the use of patterned magnetic media with hard drive magnetic media currently presents a significant technical challenge 

facing the hard drive industry but not the semiconductor industry therefore our suppliers may not be willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop manufacturing equipment for patterned magnetic media prior to a need for the equipment in the semiconductor industry we believe that if patterned magnetic media technology is not successfully implemented in the hard drive industry then alternative storage technologies like solidstate storage may more rapidly overtake hard drives as the preferred storage solution for higher capacity storage needs this result would put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our operating results 

 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however because increasing areal density has become more difficult in the hard drive industry such increases may require increases in component costs and other opportunities to reduce costs may not continue at historical rates additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gb per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we do not properly manage the technology transitions of our products our competitiveness and operating results may be negatively affected 

 

the storage markets in which we offer our products continuously undergo technology transitions which we must anticipate and adapt our products to address in a timely manner for example serial interfaces normally go through cycles in which their maximum speeds double we must effectively manage the transition of the features of our products to address these faster interface speeds in a timely manner in order to remain competitive and cost effective if we fail to successfully and timely manage the transition to faster interface speeds we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other companies that have successfully adapted their products in a timely manner and our operating results may suffer 

 

if we fail to develop and introduce new hard drives that are competitive against alternative storage technologies our business may suffer 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in order to keep pace with competing technologies alternative storage technologies like solidstate storage or flash memory technology have helped advance acceptance of “netbooks” in the pc market and have successfully served digital entertainment markets for products such as digital cameras mp3 players usb flash drives and mobile phones that require lower storage capacity devices that cannot be economically manufactured using hard drive technology typically storage needs for higher capacity and performance with lower costpergigabyte have been better served by hard drives however advances in semiconductor technology have resulted in flash memory emerging as a technology that is competitive with hard drives for niche high performance needs in advanced digital computing markets such as enterprise servers and storage in spite of the associated challenges in the attributes of cost capacity and reliability additionally solidstate storage is produced by large semiconductor companies who can sell their products at lower prices and operate their solidstate storage business unit at a loss while still remaining profitable overall in an attempt to gain market share there can be no assurance that we will be successful in anticipating and developing new products for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets in response to solidstate storage as well as other competing technologies if our hard drive technology fails to offer higher capacity performance and reliability with lower costpergigabyte than solidstate storage for the desktop mobile enterprise ce and external storage markets we will be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology to serve these markets and our business will suffer 

spending to improve our technology and develop new technology to remain competitive may negatively impact our financial results 

 

in attempting to remain competitive we may need to increase our capital expenditures and expenses above our historical runrate model in order to attempt to improve our existing technology and develop new technology increased investments in technology could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

 

our head manufacturing operations include a single wafer fabrication facility in california and a single slider fabrication and head gimbal assembly facility in thailand our magnetic media operations include three facilities in malaysia and our high volume hard drive manufacturing operations include facilities in thailand and malaysia which subjects us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and magnetic media required for the hard drives we manufacture approximately 8090 of our requirement for heads is satisfied by wafers fabricated in our fremont california facility wafers are then sent to our thailand facility for slider fabrication and wafer slicing and hga assembly and testing additionally we manufacture the majority of our magnetic media and substrates in three facilities in malaysia our high volume hard drive manufacturing facilities are in malaysia and thailand and the manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers are also in asia a fire flood earthquake or other disaster condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities would significantly affect supply of our heads or magnetic media and limit our ability to manufacture hard drives which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results similarly a localized health risk affecting our employees or the staff of our suppliers such as the spread of the influenza a h1n1 or a new pandemic influenza could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture which would result in substantial harm to our operating results 

 

our operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to optimize the overall quality timetomarket and timetovolume of new and established products 

 

to achieve consistent success with our customers we must balance several key attributes such as timetomarket timetovolume quality cost service price and a broad product portfolio our operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to 

 

  

manufacturing and marketing our products abroad subjects us to numerous risks 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations and foreign marketing efforts including 

 

 28 

 

  

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

 

we ship the majority of our products to our various customers via air freight the sudden unavailability of air cargo operations used to ship our products would impair our ability to deliver our products in a timely and efficient manner which could adversely impact our operating results we also ship a portion of our product via ocean freight and events or conditions at shipping ports such as labor difficulties or disputes could also impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver these products 

 

we are vulnerable to system failures which could harm our business 

 

we are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure among other functions to operate our factories sell our products fulfill orders manage inventory and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events our business is also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our business which could harm our reputation and financial condition 

 

if we fail to successfully integrate siliconsystems’ business and technology into our operations in a timely manner it may adversely affect our future results 

 

while we expect our recent acquisition of siliconsystems inc to have only a nominal positive impact on our results in the near term we believe that the acquisition may result in certain more significant future benefits including technology efficiencies and synergies however we may encounter difficulties in the complicated process of integrating siliconsystems’ business and technology into our existing operations if we are not able to quickly and costeffectively integrate siliconsystems’ business and technology into our operations our current operations may be disrupted and the future anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all consequently our future results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to retain or hire key staff and skilled employees our business results may suffer 

 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the data storage industry is intense and as we attempt to move to a position of technology leadership in the storage industry our business success becomes increasingly dependent on our ability to retain our key staff and skilled employees as well as attract integrate and retain new skilled employees volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the overall markets may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation this risk increases during periods of declining stock price which may cause many of our key staff and skilled employees to lose much of the value of the equity compensation that they have received as an incentive to remain in our employ and work towards the success of our operations additionally because a substantial portion of our key employees’ compensation is placed “at risk” and linked to the performance of our business when our operating results are negatively impacted by events such as the current global economic downturn we are at a competitive disadvantage for retaining and hiring key staff and skilled employees versus other companies that pay a relatively higher fixed salary if we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 

 

the data storage industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology if a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology despite the safeguards we have in place it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do us laws in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

 

the costs of compliance with environmental regulation and customers’ standards of corporate citizenship could cause an increase in our operating costs 

 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate for example the european union “eu” has 

enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to takeback and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products we will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our component suppliers also timely comply with such laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations as well as our compliance with industry environmental initiatives the standards of business conduct required by some of our customers and our commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of our business we could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliance with these initiatives or standards of conduct we could be subject to governmental fines liability to our customers and damage to our reputation and corporate brand which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

 

because we manufacture our products abroad our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the thai baht and of the malaysian ringgit may negatively impact our operating results the thai baht is a free floating currency while the malaysian ringgit exchange rate policy is one of a managed float we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place currently we hedge the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and british pound sterling with forward contracts 

 

if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated 

 

additionally we negotiate and procure some of our component requirements in us dollars from japanese and other nonus based vendors if the us dollar continues to weaken against other foreign currencies some of our component suppliers may increase the price which they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin if this occurs it would have a negative impact on our operating results 

 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs 

 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly results 

 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

  

rapidly changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to predict actual results 

 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

  

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock 

 

 32 

 

  

in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio 

 

our longterm investments consist of auctionrate securities totaling 18 million as of july 3 2009 the negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auctionrate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities if the credit market does not improve auctions for our invested amounts may continue to fail if an auction fails for securities in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auctionrate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities in the event we need or desire to access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par or current carrying value we may incur a loss beyond losses already recognized by us on these securities for example during the year ended july 3 2009 the market values of some of the auctionrate securities we owned were impacted by the macroeconomic credit market conditions and as a result we recognized 10 million of otherthantemporary losses to mark the investments to estimated market value further rating downgrades of the security issuer or the thirdparties insuring such investments may require us to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an additional impairment charge 

 

current economic conditions have caused us difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and shortterm investments from financial institution failures 

 

the negative global economic conditions and volatile investment markets have caused us to hold more cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments than we would hold under normal circumstances since there has been an overall increase in demand for lowrisk us government backed securities with a limited supply in the financial marketplace we face increased difficulty in adequately protecting our increased cash and shortterm investments from possible sudden and unforeseeable failures by banks and other financial institutions a failure of any of these financial institutions in which deposits exceed fdic limits could have an adverse impact on our financial position 

 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 

 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of july 3 2009 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods however if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective or if we identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in our financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price 

 

the outcome of our ongoing domestic and foreign tax audits may negatively impact our operating results 

 

as we have previously disclosed we are under examination of certain of our fiscal years by the us internal revenue service the “irs” separately our french subsidiary is under examination by the french tax authorities although we 

believe our tax positions for the years under review are reasonable the outcomes and timing of these audits are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in us having to pay amounts to the irs or french tax authorities in order to resolve examination of our tax positions which could result in an increase or decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits and may negatively impact our financial position results of operations net income or cash flows

results of operations 

 

on september 5 2007 we completed our acquisition of komag incorporated “komag” and on march 27 2009 we completed our acquisition of siliconsystems in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” operating results for komag and siliconsystems prior to the dates of their acquisitions are not included in our operating results which therefore affects our discussion of changes in our revenues and expenses for the periods prior to the acquisitions as compared to the periods after the acquisitions 

 

fiscal 2009 overview 

 

in 2009 our net revenue decreased by 8 to 75 billion on hard drive shipments of 146 million units as compared to 81 billion and 133 million units respectively in 2008 in 2009 62 of our hard drive revenue was derived from nondesktop sources including ce products enterprise applications notebook computers and retail sales as compared to 56 in 2008 hard drive average selling price decreased to 51 in 2009 from 59 in 2008 gross margin percentage decreased to 179 in 2009 from 215 in 2008 operating income decreased by 487 million to 519 million in 2009 which included a 14 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of siliconsystems 112 million of restructuring charges and an 18 million gain on the sale of assets from our media substrate manufacturing facility in sarawak malaysia operating income was 10 billion in 2008 which included a 49 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of komag as a percentage of net revenue operating income was 70 in 2009 compared to 124 in 2008 net income in 2009 was 470 million or 208 per diluted share compared to 867 million or 384 per diluted share in 2008 

 

during december 2008 our second fiscal quarter we announced a restructuring plan to realign our cost structure as a result of a softer demand environment this plan was completed during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2009 this resulted in the closure of one of our hard drive manufacturing facilities in thailand the disposal of our media substrate manufacturing facility in sarawak malaysia and headcount reductions throughout the world of approximately 3300 people restructuring costs totaled 112 million and consisted of 81 million of asset impairment charges 27 million of employee termination benefits and 4 million of contract termination and other exit costs total cash expenditures related to the restructuring activities were approximately 31 million during our fourth fiscal quarter we sold our media substrate manufacturing facility and related assets in sarawak malaysia for net proceeds of approximately 29 million resulting in a gain of 18 million the closure and disposal of our manufacturing facilities was to realign our manufacturing capacity with our expectations regarding demand at that time during our fourth fiscal quarter we experienced a much stronger demand than originally anticipated we expect continuing sequential growth in our first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result in our first quarter of fiscal 2010 we reopened the hard drive manufacturing facility in thailand that we previously closed as part of our restructuring plan 

we also completed our acquisition of siliconsystems resulting in a total acquisition cost of 66 million consisting of 65 million in cash paid to siliconsystems shareholders and 1 million of other direct acquisition costs

the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth for the periods presented summary information regarding volume shipments average selling prices “asps” and revenues by geography channel and product in millions except percentages and asps 

 

 

 

 

  

fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 

 

net revenue net revenue was 75 billion for 2009 a decrease of 8 from 2008 total unit shipments of hard drives increased to 146 million as compared to 133 million for the prior year the decrease in revenue primarily resulted from a decline in our asps which reflects a more competitive pricing environment particularly in the notebook and branded markets the decline in our asps was partially offset by an increase in unit shipments of 25inch drives we shipped 56 million 25inch drives in 2009 as compared to 37 million units in 2008 the increase in 25inch unit 

shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and netbook pc demand coupled with increased customer preference for our product offerings 

 

changes in revenue by geography and by channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as well as demand strength in asia which continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of mobile hard drives to oems 

 

we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for 2009 these programs represented 11 of gross revenues compared to 10 in 2008 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2009 was 13 billion a decrease of 402 million or 23 over the prior year gross margin percentage decreased to 179 in 2009 from 215 in 2008 this decrease is due to a more competitive pricing environment primarily resulting from an increase in product offerings in the mobile and branded markets 

 

operating expenses total research and development “rd” expense and selling general and administrative “sga” expense increased to 95 of net revenue in 2009 compared to 85 in 2008 rd expense was 509 million in 2009 an increase of 45 million or 10 over the prior year this increase in rd expense includes 76 million relating to product development to support new programs offset by a 31 million decrease in variable incentive compensation as a percentage of net revenue rd expense increased to 68 in 2009 compared to 57 in 2008 primarily due to continued investment in product development sga expense was 201 million in 2009 a decrease of 19 million or 86 as compared to 2008 this decrease in sga expense primarily resulted from a 19 million decrease in variable incentive compensation and a 6 million insurance recovery offset by a 6 million net increase in the expansion of our sales and marketing presence into new regions sga expense was 27 as a percentage of revenue in both 2009 and 2008 

 

during 2009 we recorded a 14 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of siliconsystems during 2008 we recorded a 49 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of komag these charges relate to projects that were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use and therefore the fair value of the development effort did not quality for capitalization and was immediately expensed during 2009 we also recorded 112 million in restructuring charges and an 18 million gain on the sale of assets from our media substrate manufacturing facility in sarawak malaysia 

 

other income expense net interest and other expense was 18 million in 2009 compared to 25 million in 2008 this change was primarily due to a decrease in the variable interest rate on our debt and a 3 million decrease in losses on our auctionrate securities 

 

income tax provision income tax expense was 31 million in 2009 compared to 114 million in 2008 tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 6 in 2009 compared to 12 for 2008 differences between the effective tax rates and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive programs and the current year generation of income tax credits we have tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various times through 2022 in 2009 income tax expense includes a provision of 42 million offset by 6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the us federal research and development tax credit enacted into law in october 2008 and a favorable adjustment of 5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits in 2008 tax expense included net charges of 60 million for taxes incurred upon the license of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary in our first fiscal quarter 

 

we recognized a 29 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2009 as of july 3 2009 we had approximately 136 million of unrecognized tax benefits which if recognized would decrease the effective tax rate in subsequent years 

 

fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 

 

net revenue net revenue was 81 billion for 2008 an increase of 48 from 2007 total unit shipments increased to 133 million as compared to 97 million for the prior year this unit increase resulted from an increase in higher overall 

demand for hard drives and our continuing diversification into nondesktop markets including mobile consumer electronics enterprise and branded products for example we shipped 37 million 25 inch drives to the mobile and branded markets in 2008 as compared to 12 million units in 2007 additionally we shipped 15 million units to the dvr market in 2008 as compared to 10 million units in 2007 asps increased to 59 due to an improved mix of revenues by market category improved product mix and more favorable demandsupply conditions changes in revenue by geography generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as well as an increase in mobile drives sold to asia changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of mobile hard drives to oems and an increase in sales of branded products due to the growing worldwide acceptance of our my passport ® and my book ® external digital storage appliances 

 

we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue for the year ended june 27 2008 these programs represented 10 in 2008 compared to 7 in 2007 these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2008 was 17 billion an increase of 839 million or 93 over 2007 gross margin percentage increased to 215 in 2008 from 165 in 2007 the factors contributing to this increase were an improved mix of revenues by market category improved product mix and more favorable demandsupply conditions our manufacturing throughput and costs also improved through operational efficiencies higher utilization and a higher mix of products based on newer more costeffective technologies and the contribution of media operations 

 

operating expenses total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” decreased to 85 of net revenue in 2008 compared to 89 in 2007 rd expense was 464 million in 2008 an increase of 158 million or 52 over the prior year this increase in rd expense includes 75 million relating to the acquired media operations 52 million related to product development to support new programs and 31 million in incentive and equity compensation as a percentage of net revenue rd expense remained consistent at 57 in 2008 compared to 56 in 2007 sga expense was 220 million in 2008 an increase of 41 million or 23 as compared to 2007 this increase in sga expense includes 28 million for the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and 13 million in higher incentive and equity compensation as a percentage of net revenue sga expense decreased to 27 in 2008 from 33 in 2007 primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

during 2008 we recorded a 49 million charge to operating expense related to an inprocess research and development project acquired from komag involving technology for higher recording densities on advanced perpendicular recording magnetic media as these advanced products were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use the fair value of the development effort did not qualify for capitalization and was immediately expensed 

 

other income expense net interest and other expense was 25 million in 2008 compared to net interest and other income of 28 million in 2007 this decrease is a result of higher debt balances and realized and recognized losses on investments of 13 million 

 

income tax provision income tax expense was 114 million in 2008 compared to an income tax benefit of 121 million in 2007 tax provision as a percentage of income before taxes was 12 in 2008 compared to tax benefit as a percentage of income of 27 for 2007 differences between the effective tax rates and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive programs and the current year generation of income tax credits we have tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various times through 2022 in 2008 income tax expense also includes net charges of 60 million for taxes incurred upon the license of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary in our first fiscal quarter in 2007 the tax provision was impacted by a favorable adjustment to the company’s valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 126 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 we reversed the remaining valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based upon a determination that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in future years the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or company conditions 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” as of june 30 2007 as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognized no adjustment in the net liability for unrecognized tax benefits the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption of fin 48 was 58 million all of which would affect our effective tax rate if realized during the year ended june 27 2008 we recognized a 17 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and recorded 32 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to komag as of june 27 2008 we had approximately 107 million of unrecognized tax benefits which included the 32 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to komag

we ended 2009 with total cash and cash equivalents of 18 billion an increase of 690 million from june 27 2008 the following table summarizes the results of our statements of cash flows for the three years ended july 3 2009 

 

 

 

our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds we believe our current cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the foreseeable future our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that are discussed in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was 13 billion as compared to 14 billion for 2008 and 618 million for 2007 cash flow from operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash provided by changes in working capital was 198 million for 2009 as compared to 22 million for 2008 and 78 million used to fund working capital for 2007 

 

our working capital requirements primarily depend upon the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the following table summarizes the cash conversion cycle for the three years ended 2009 

 

 

 

for the year ended july 3 2009 our days sales outstanding “dsos” increased by 1 day days in inventory “dios” decreased by 1 day and days payables outstanding remained consistent with 2008 

 

from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make these modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the 

payment modifications through negotiations with or by granting to or receiving from our vendors payment term accommodations 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities for 2009 was 551 million as compared to 13 billion for 2008 and 383 million for 2007 during 2009 cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of 519 million for capital expenditures and 63 million for the acquisition of siliconsystems net of cash acquired during 2008 cash used in investing activities consisted of 927 million for the acquisition of komag net of cash acquired and 615 million for capital expenditures partially offset by net cash provided by investments of 221 million the decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of the expected reduction in market demand due to the macroeconomic conditions capital expenditures in 2009 primarily consisted of the expansion of our head wafer fabrication facilities continued investment in advanced head technologies and increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio 

 

for 2010 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 600 million and depreciation and amortization to be approximately 530 million 

 

our cash equivalents are invested primarily in readily accessible aaa rated institutional money market funds which are invested in us treasury securities us treasury bills and us government agency securities we also have auctionrate securities that are classified as longterm investments as they are expected to be held until secondary markets become available these investments are currently accounted for as availableforsale securities and recorded at fair value within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet the estimated market values of these investments are subject to fluctuation the carrying value of our investments in auctionrate securities was reduced from 28 million as of june 27 2008 to 18 million as of july 3 2009 as a result of the recognition of 10 million in otherthantemporary losses that were recorded through earnings 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used by financing activities for 2009 was 64 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities for 2008 of 326 million net cash used in financing activities was 86 million for 2007 the net cash provided by financing activities in 2009 consisted of 28 million provided by the issuance of stock under employee plans offset by 36 million used to repurchase our common stock a 24 million decrease in excess tax benefits from employee stock plans 5 million in tax withholding obligations paid in connection with the vesting of stock awards under employee stock plans and 27 million used to repay longterm debt the net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 consisted of 500 million in net proceeds from debt 89 million provided by an increase in excess tax benefits from employee stock plans 65 million provided by the issuance of stock under employee stock plans offset by a 250 million repayment of convertible debentures assumed in the acquisition of komag 60 million used to repurchase our common stock 13 million used to repay other longterm debt and 5 million in tax withholding obligations paid in connection with the vesting of stock awards under employee stock plans the net cash used in financing activities in 2007 consisted of 73 million used for repurchases of our common stock 43 million used for repayments of longterm debt 9 million in tax withholding obligations paid in connection with the vesting of stock awards under employee stock plans offset by 39 million provided by the issuance of stock under employee plans 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

other than facility and equipment lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions see “contractual obligations and commitments” below we do not have any offbalance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities guarantee contracts retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity we do not have any majorityowned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements additionally we do not have an interest in or relationships with any specialpurpose entities 

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of july 3 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

longterm debt 

 

in february 2008 western digital technologies inc “wdti” a whollyowned subsidiary of the company entered into a fiveyear credit agreement “credit facility” that provides for a 750 million unsecured loan consisting of a 500 million term loan facility and a 250 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline in addition wdti may elect to expand the credit facility by up to 250 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments the 500 million term loan had a variable interest rate of 163 as of july 3 2009 and requires sixteen quarterly principal payments that began in june 2009 of approximately 19 million 25 million 31 million and 50 million per quarter for each four quarter increment the credit facility requires wdti to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio calculated on a consolidated basis for the company and its subsidiaries in addition the credit facility contains customary covenants including covenants that limit or restrict wdti’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens incur indebtedness make certain restricted payments merge or consolidate and enter into certain speculative hedging arrangements as of july 3 2009 wdti had 250 million available for future borrowings on the revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 

 

purchase orders 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment 

 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers which contain minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above we have also entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases contingent on certain conditions of performance quality and technology of the vendor’s components these arrangements are included under “purchase obligations” in the table above 

 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining 

competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to these commitments 

 

foreign exchange contracts 

 

we purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for our current forward exchange contract commitments 

 

indemnifications 

 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

our board of directors previously authorized us to repurchase 750 million of our common stock in open market transactions under a program through march 31 2013 since the inception of this stock repurchase program in 2005 through july 3 2009 we have repurchased 18 million shares for a total cost of 284 million including commissions we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

 

revenue and accounts receivable 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we provide resellers with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other sales incentive programs in accordance with current accounting standards we recognize revenue upon delivery to oems odms and resellers and record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers we base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period reseller’s sellthrough and inventory levels estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers historical pricing information and customer claim processing if customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differ from our expectations our operating results could be affected we also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” and such sales incentive and marketing programs are recorded 

as a reduction of revenue these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions seasonal demand competitor actions channel mix and overall availability of product since 2007 total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 7 to 12 of gross revenues per quarter changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to increase our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 02 of quarterly gross revenue since 2007 

 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could affect operating results 

 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could negatively affect operating results 

 

warranty 

 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected also during a period of declining revenue the percentage of warranty utilization to revenue may increase our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

inventory 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value we use the firstin firstout method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories while we use the weightedaverage method to value precious metal inventories weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production the weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a firstin firstout method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could negatively affect operating results 

litigation and other contingencies 

 

we apply sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies accordingly we disclose material contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when in consultation with our legal advisors we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss “nol” and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed in financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefit in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for all stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” under these provisions stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan “espp” shares are estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions under sfas 123r we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurement in february 2008 fasb issued fasb staff position 1572 “effective date of fasb statement 157” “fsp 1572” which delays the effective date of sfas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those years which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the partial adoption of sfas 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities in our first quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 157 will have on the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 

we chose not to elect the fair value option for eligible items and accordingly the adoption of sfas 159 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree sfas 141r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010 sfas 141r will impact the company’s consolidated financial statements for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activitiesan amendment of fasb statement no 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 updates guidance regarding disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities the adoption of sfas 161 in our third quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” “fsp fas 1423” which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fsp fas 1423 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of fsp fas 1423 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp fas 1071 and abp 281 “interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” “fsp fas 1071 and abp 281” which amends sfas no 107 “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” and abp opinion no 28 “interim financial reporting” to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual reporting periods fsp fas 1071 and abp 281 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 “recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments” “fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242” which amends the otherthantemporary impairment guidance in us gaap for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to modify the presentation and disclosure of otherthantemporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements the adoption of fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in may 2009 the fasb issued sfas 165 “subsequent events” “sfas 165” which establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued sfas 165 requires disclosure of the date through which the company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure sfas 165 also requires events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet and the related estimates to be recognized in the financial statements events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued should not be recognized but should be disclosed if material the adoption of sfas 165 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact 

of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase shortterm foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes currently we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and the british pound sterling malaysian ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges euro and british pound sterling contracts are designated as fair value hedges thai baht contracts are designated as both cash flow and fair value hedges see part ii item 8 note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

as of july 3 2009 we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

 

 

 

 

  

in 2009 2008 and 2007 total net realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

 

disclosure about other market risks 

 

variable interest rate risk 

 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of wdti either a a libor rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs the “eurocurrency rate” or b a base rate determined by reference to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 and ii the prime rate as announced by jpmorgan chase bank na the “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility ranges from 125 to 150 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margin for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 08 to 1125 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis if the federal funds rate prime rate or libor rate increases our interest payments could also increase a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the credit facility would increase interest expense by approximately 5 million annually 

 

credit market risk 

 

our longterm investments consist of auctionrate securities totaling 18 million as of july 3 2009 the negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented us from liquidating some of our holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities if the credit markets do not improve auctions for our invested amounts may continue to fail if this occurs we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auctionrate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities prior to maturity of the underlying assets in the event we need or desire to access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss the market values of some of the auctionrate securities we owned were impacted by the macroeconomic credit market conditions rating downgrades of the security issuer or the thirdparties insuring such investments may require us to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and cash generated from operations we do not anticipate these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see page 52 herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended july 3 2009 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving 

its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and original design manufacturers “odms” for use in computer systems subsystems or ce devices and to distributors resellers and retailers our hard drives are used in desktop computers notebook computers and enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage storage area networks and video surveillance equipment additionally our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” we also sell our hard drives as standalone storage products and integrate them into external casings embedding application software and presenting them as wd ® branded external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music photographs video and other data 

 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device our hard drives currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes “gb” to 1 terabyte “tb” nominal rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including both enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” and serial advanced technology attachment “sata” we also embed our hard drives into wd ® branded external storage appliances that utilize interfaces such as usb 20 external sata firewire tm and ethernet network connections in addition we recently announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives utilizing our green power tm technology 

 

we manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies “hsas” in malaysia and thailand we also design and manufacture most of our required magnetic heads in california and head gimbal assemblies “hgas” in thailand and we design in california and manufacture in malaysia most of our required media and substrates for geographical financial data see part ii item 8 note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

on september 5 2007 we completed our acquisition the “acquisition” of komag incorporated “komag” through a cash tender offer by state m corporation “state m” our indirect whollyowned subsidiary for all outstanding shares of komag’s common stock which was followed by a merger of state m and komag the “merger” whereby komag became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary and changed its name to wd media inc the acquisition has strengthened our production efficiencies and improved our access to and control of technology and competitive position in the worldwide hard drive industry while enhancing our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating media the aggregate purchase price for komag was approximately 1 billion consisting of cash paid for outstanding shares transaction fees severance and other employeerelated equity payments 

 

business strategy 

 

our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of reliable high quality hard drives at a low total cost of ownership and with high efficiency and speed we believe this strategy helps accomplish the following 

 

  

we have designed our business strategy to accommodate significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high asset utilization 

industry 

 

we design develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop and mobile pc enterprise ce and branded product retail markets we believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has continued to outpace the growth in the sales of all pcs as there were approximately 88 more hard drives sold in the market than pcs in calendar 2007 based on industry data we believe the following factors continue to drive this accelerating growth of hard drive sales in addition to pc applications 

 

  

additionally we believe that the demand for 25inch hard drives has grown from approximately 16 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2003 to 34 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2007 driven principally by the fastgrowing market for notebook computers 

 

these factors and our product expansion strategy have gradually increased our percentage of revenue derived from nondesktop sources in 2008 56 of our revenue was from nondesktop sources compared to 43 in 2007

desktop pc market 

 

the desktop pc market consists of the overall hard drive market for desktop computers individuals use desktop computers in homes businesses and multiuser networks desktop computers use software applications for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and for other needs hard drives store desktop computer operating system and application software as well as the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop pc market has grown in part due to 

 

  

we believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop computer unit growth including maturing desktop pc markets in north america and western europe an increase in firsttime buyers of desktop computers in asia eastern europe and latin america and the lengthening of desktop computer replacement cycles 

 

mobile pc market 

 

the mobile pc market consists primarily of notebook computers individuals use notebook computers both in and away from homes and businesses like desktop computers notebook computers use software applications for various needs and hard drives store notebook operating system and application software and the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile pc market has grown in part due to 

 

 5 

 

  

we expect the mobile pc market to continue to grow faster than the desktop or enterprise markets in the next three years as the mobile pc market continues to evolve to a higher volume market we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on attributes such as quality availability reliability execution flexibility and the competitive cost structures of their hard drive suppliers these are the same attributes that have been emphasized for many years by customers in the highvolume desktop pc market 

 

enterprise market 

 

the enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations servers network attached storage storage area networks other computing systems or subsystems and video surveillance historically hard drives for this market have utilized several interfaces including the small computer systems interface “scsi” and fibre channel arbitrated loop “fcal” beginning in 2003 these traditional enterprise interfaces have been supplemented or have been replaced in certain storage applications by hard drives featuring the sata interface technology which is supported by industry standards as well as by serial attached scsi “sas” sata hard drives typically cost customers less than scsi hard drives while offering higher capacities and maintaining similar reliability scalability and performance 

 

we believe that enterprise uses of sata hard drives will continue to increase during the past few years a new diskbased backup application has emerged with highcapacity sata hard drives augmenting scsi hard drives tape and optical media this new application popularly referred to as “nearline” storage has created a growth market because hard drives back up or access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions and quickly retrieve critical backup or nearline data the availability of sata hard drive solutions which are more cost effective than scsi hard drives promotes the increasing use of highcapacity hard drives in nearline storage applications the low price per capacity of sata drives has stimulated new applications such as video surveillance video editingbroadcasting and medical imaging these applications represent segments of a growing market for high capacity storage in noncomputing imaging and multimedia professions 

 

enterpriseclass sata drives are becoming commonplace for it infrastructure applications such as databases scientific computing web content web caching web search engines and electronic mail these applications have become an important market for highcapacity sata hard drives we believe that this market will consume a growing portion of the highest capacity hard drives in the next three years 

 

sas is the next generation scsi technology and is expected to replace scsi drives over the next few years sata technology is compatible with sas technology enabling customers the flexibility of incorporating sata hard drives in sas storage systems we believe the market transition from scsi to sas will add to the growth of the enterpriseclass sata market which currently is estimated to be approximately 40 of the enterprise hard drive market 

 

highperformance applications such as blade servers are increasingly using 25inch form factor hard drives supplanting traditional 35inch drives smaller form factors enable more drives per physical space for increased performance higher capacity per square foot and lower power consumption this trend demonstrates the fragmentation of the enterprise hard drive market and the need for applicationspecific enterpriseclass hard drives 

 

consumer electronics market 

 

the use of hard drives in ce products has been a major growth area in recent years currently the three largest segments of this market are 

 

 6 

 

since 1999 dvrs have been available for use in home entertainment systems and they offer enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program additionally digital video disk “dvd” recorders increasingly incorporate hard drives to allow for dvr functionality and faster recording of content onto removable dvds the market for these products favors larger capacity hard drives and continues to grow in japan north america and europe additionally the rest of asia pacific shows strong interest in this market we believe growth in this market will continue to build demand for higher capacity hard drives 

 

the proliferation in the ce market of more sophisticated mobile devices including cell phones and mp3 players is driving the delivery of diverse content from hard drive intensive hosts we believe this is one of the factors influencing increased sales of enterpriseclass sata drives we also believe that multimedia handheld devices such as video cameras and highresolution still cameras are enabling consumer production of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of small formfactor hard drive storage as well as highcapacity desktopclass hard drives for editing manipulation and longterm storage of such content 

 

hard drives with 18inch or 10inch form factors primarily address the consumer handheld device and portable external storage markets the majority of hard drives used in portable media players that play both digital audio and video content are 18inch form factors currently we believe the markets for these handheld devices are better served by flash memory as opposed to rotating magnetic storage 

 

external hard drive market 

 

most new pc systems include highspeed external interfaces such as usb 20 external sata firewire tm or ethernet network connections that permit users to supplement the storage space of their pc systems or home and small office networks with the use of external hard drives users store additional programs or multimedia content and back up internal hard drives with external hard drives as well as mobile external hard drives for mobility convenience although external hard drives are a small part of the overall hard drive market we believe that sales of external hard drives will continue to grow external storage can often be the easiest quickest or only way of adding additional storage capacity to either a desktop or notebook computer we believe there is an increasing consumer awareness of the need and value of securely storing personal digital content through backup applications and devices in addition there is opportunity for external storage as a way of expanding storage capacity in ce devices such as dvrs 

 

other market opportunities 

 

we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve based on significant investments we made over the last five years we believe we have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market penetration and be a fullline hard drive supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the recent past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions 

 

products 

 

we offer a broad line of hard drives designed for various markets we market our hard drives under brand names including wd caviar wd raptor wd velociraptor wd scorpio wd elements my passport my book my dvr expander and greenpower these hard drives service the desktop mobile enterprise ce and branded products markets and can be found in products including desktop computers notebook computers enterprise storage workstations video surveillance equipment networking products dvrs stbs and external storage appliances 

 

desktop hard drive products 

 

the hard drives we design for the desktop pc market currently consist of 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 40 gb to 1 tb these products utilize either the eide or sata interfaces providing high performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection the type of eide interface currently used in our hard drives is ata100 which signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second which is the maximum specified data transition that can be sustained under ideal conditions the sata interface available in the majority of our hard drives enable burst transfer rates of up to 300 megabytes per second 

mobile hard drive products 

 

our hard drives used in mobile products typically include 25inch form factor drives for notebook computers although the desktop pc market still accounts for a majority of hard drive sales unit shipments of hard drives for notebook computers represent a growing share of the total we entered the 25inch mobile market in september 2004 we are now shipping our fifth generation of the wd scorpio ® product family offering up to 320 gb of capacity our product expansion including a recently announced highperformance hard drive spinning at 7200 rpm has enabled us to provide customers with a fullline of 25inch mobile drives and helped us enhance our market position in this fastgrowing market 

 

enterprise hard drive products 

 

we offer multiple product lines to address enterprise market needs including 

 

  

both wd velociraptor tm and wd ® re drives may be used in but are not limited to applications such as databases ecommerce and super computing in life science oil and gas and similar industries business records management email file serving web serving nearline storage medical records engineering data management video broadcasting and video security the wd velociraptor tm also has been popular for use in the highend desktop pc market for applications including gaming and advanced cadcam “computer aided designcomputeraided manufacturing” systems

technology and product development 

 

hard drives record store and retrieve digital data performance attributes of hard drives such as their ability to access and transmit data and storage capacity are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical hard drives and tapes and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 

  

all of our hard drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard drive are a headdiskassembly “hda” and a printed circuit board assembly “pcba” the hda includes heads media “disks” head positioning mechanism “actuator” and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment the pcba includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector 

 

hda one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the diskpack assembly the disk is made up of a smooth substrate on which thin layers of magnetic materials are deposited the hsa is comprised of a magnetic positioner a pivotarm module on which the individual heads are mounted each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

 

pcba the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the host computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the host computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on 

logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the hsa pivots in an arc across the disk until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

 

industry standard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interfaces for pcs are eide and sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are scsi sata sas and fcal as computer performance continues to improve the hard drive will need to deliver information faster we believe this will continue to drive the pc industry transition to higher speed interfaces such as sata and sas to facilitate the higher data transfer rates we currently offer the sata interface on our wd caviar ®  wd scorpio ®  wd ® re wd velociraptor tm and wd ® av hard drive families and eide on wd caviar ®  wd scorpio ® and wd ® av families 

 

the number of disks and each disk’s areal density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk determines storage capacity of the hard drive the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter achieving a given drive capacity requires fewer disks and heads as the areal density increases potentially reducing product costs over time through reduced component requirements beginning in june 2007 we began shipping 35inch hard drives with 188 gb per platter areal density and 25inch hard drives with 125 gb per platter areal density in july 2007 we introduced the wd caviar ® greenpower tm 35inch hard drive which has 250 gb per platter areal density in october 2007 we introduced wd scorpio ® 25inch drives that employ 160 gb per platter technology in january 2008 we began shipping a 35inch hard drive platform with 320 gb per platter areal density and in june 2008 we began shipping our wd caviar ® family of drives at 333 gb per platter areal density in april 2008 we began shipping wd velociraptor tm hard drives 25inch 300 gb drives employing the highest shipping areal density in the industry at 290 gigabits per square inch 

 

head technology is one of the key components affecting areal density historically there have been rapid technological changes resulting in several generations of head technology in a relatively short time however in recent years the time has lengthened between changes in generations of head technology the hard drive industry has essentially transitioned from the use of longitudinal magnetic recording “lmr” head technology for the head writer function to perpendicular magnetic recording “pmr” technology which allows for significantly higher storage capacities in addition the industry has made the transition to tunneljunction magneto resistive “tmr” technology for the head reader function we have completed the transition to pmr and tmr in our 25inch products and in the majority of our 35inch products 

 

with the transition to pmr media plays a much more important role in achieving higher areal density pmr demands a much tighter interaction and matching between head and media designs the acquisition of komag has enabled us to be vertically integrated in the two most important technology components of hard drives heads and media and has enabled us to achieve a more optimum design and utilization of these components 

 

we invest considerable resources in research and development manufacturing infrastructure and capital equipment of head and media components in order to secure our competitive position and cost structure 

 

the wd ® product line generally leverages a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families and in some cases across product families which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models 

 

fiscal 2008 represented the sixth consecutive year of substantial growth in our research and development and capital spending to support our significant broadening of our product and technology portfolios over that sixyear period we have grown our investment spending 173 from 170 million in fiscal 2002 to 464 million in fiscal 2008 as a result of this investment activity we continue to expand our business beyond the desktop pc market into newer markets or markets in which we have not previously participated such investments have allowed us to execute against our strategic objective of revenue diversification to address the growth of new applications for hard drives and fastgrowing new market opportunities 

 

we are currently expanding our existing head wafer fabrication facilities in fremont california to accommodate our anticipated growth the expansion will involve a process change to utilize 8inch wafers from 6inch wafers and will cost an estimated 280 million in the fiscal 2009 to 2010 timeframe this will be in addition to our ongoing capital expenditures for hard drive and head assembly and our anticipated capital expenditures for media development and manufacturing following our planned acquisition of komag

sales and distribution 

 

we sell our products globally to oems odms distributors and retailers oems purchase our hard drives either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an odm and assemble them into the computer or ce systems they build distributors typically sell our hard drives to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers retailers typically sell our hard drive products directly to endusers through their storefront or online facilities 

 

original equipment manufacturers 

 

sales to oems which include sales through odms accounted for 51 48 and 54 of our hard drive revenue in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively during 2008 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue during 2007 and 2006 sales to dell inc accounted for 10 and 12 respectively of our revenue we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our strong relationships with the leading oems 

 

oems evaluate and select their hard drive suppliers based on a number of factors including quality and reliability storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability they typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of hard drives and once an oem has chosen its qualified hard drive vendors for a given product it generally will purchase hard drives from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with oem qualifications a hard drive supplier must consistently offer hard drives featuring leading technology quality and reliability at acceptable capacity per disk suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of each new generation of high quality and reliable hard drives requiring access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities 

 

many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” in which they do not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” in which the oem contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer such as an odm who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the oem’s instructions for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our need to adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

distributors 

 

we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors accounted for approximately 31 36 and 39 of our hard drive revenue for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories we grant our distributors limited price protection rights 

 

retailers 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers retailers accounted for approximately 18 16 and 7 of our hard drive revenue for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for wd and our products retailers supply endusers with products to upgrade their computers and externally store their data for backup or mobility purposes we grant our retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis we also sell our branded products through our web site 

sales and marketing 

 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific japan europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 76 68 and 68 of our revenue for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for an additional discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international customers see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and significant customer information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms we target advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and enduser categories we utilize both consumer media and trade publications we have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures we also maintain customer relationships by communicating with our resellers and providing endusers with information and support through our web site 

 

competition 

 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use in desktop notebook enterprise ce and external storage products our competitors in the hard drive market include excelstor technology fujitsu limited hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics incorporated seagate technology and toshiba corporation 

 

the hard drive industry is intensely competitive with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors 

 

we believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products therefore we believe that we cannot differentiate wd ® hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly we differentiate wd by focusing on operational excellence high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating into our hard drives desirable product performance attributes such performance attributes include seek times data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics error recovery low operating temperature low power consumption and optimized streaming capabilities 

 

in addition we differentiate wd by emphasizing nonproduct related attributes including rapid response to our customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction we also rely on the strength of the wd brand name with valueadded resellers retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive products directly and indirectly we believe that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation its execution track record and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard drive particularly in a rapidly changing technology environment 

 

advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products we monitor the advantages disadvantages and advances of the full array of storage technologies on an ongoing basis 

 

highspeed semiconductor memory competes with hard drive products in some applications such as consumer handheld devices and portable external storage semiconductor memory is much faster in some applications than magnetic hard drives but currently is not competitive in most applications using 35inch and 25inch form factor hard drives from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has 

higher “read” performance attributes than hard drives it has lower “write” performance attributes flash memory could become more competitive in the near future for additional applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives however we believe that the traditional highvolume computing markets will remain the domain of 35inch and 25inch hard drives based on the hard drive industry’s attributes of reliability availability and cost 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to competition see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

service and warranty 

 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive we have engaged third parties in various countries in multiple regions including africa asia pacific australia europe india latin america the middle east and north america to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned hard drives for our customers in addition we process test and recertify returned hard drives at our facility in the united states 

 

manufacturing 

 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and have the ability to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations to be competitive we must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products and highquality components that we manufacture ourselves while insisting that our suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key supplier relationships by establishing close relationships with our strategic component suppliers we believe we access bestofclass technology and manufacturing quality in addition we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

 

hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

 

we manufacture hard drives in malaysia and thailand we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

 

we use our wafer fabrication facilities in fremont california and our slider fabrication facility in bang pain thailand to design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and hgas we include in the hard drives we manufacture 

 

we are currently expanding our head wafer fabrication facilities in fremont california and expect to complete the expansion in calendar 2009 which will provide us with adequate wafer fabrication capacity for the foreseeable future 

 

following our acquisition of komag we also have media and substrate design and manufacturing facilities in malaysia we use these facilities to design and manufacture most of the media and substrates that we use in our products 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

materials and supplies 

 

the following products are the major components currently used in the manufacture of our hard drives 

 

 13 

 

  

we also use several other components in our hard drives such as seals filters plastic molded parts capacitors resistors connectors and cables 

 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads media and substrates required for the hard drives we manufacture we purchase a portion of these components from third party suppliers 

 

we acquire all of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons 

 

we solesource some components such as custom integrated circuit devices for certain products from suppliers like marvell technology stmicroelectronics and texas instruments because of their custom nature these products require significant designin periods and long lead times there has been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased integration of various separate circuits and we expect this trend to continue in custom integrated circuits for hard drives 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our component supplies see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

backlog 

 

historically a substantial portion of our orders have been for shipments of hard drives within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order we generally negotiate pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions before receiving a customer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition we make many of our sales to oems under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead we receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods 

 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

 

we own numerous patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states 

 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell wd products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard drive industry for additional discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

environmental regulation 

 

we are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with our operations we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations for additional discussion of risks related to environmental regulation see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

employees 

 

as of june 27 2008 we employed a total of 50072 employees worldwide this represents an increase in headcount of approximately 69 since june 29 2007 and an increase of approximately 102 since june 30 2006 many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors we and most of our competitors nevertheless have difficulty at times hiring and retaining certain skilled employees we have engaged consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited we consider our employee relations to be good for additional discussion of risks related to our skilled employees see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

 

declines in average selling prices “asps” in the hard drive industry could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the hard drive industry historically has experienced declining asps our asps tend to decline when competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share our asps also decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products when asps in the hard drive industry decline our asps are also likely to decline which adversely affects our operating results 

 

if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets for hard drives our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

over the past few years the consumer market for computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems if we are not able to continue to offer a competitively priced hard drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results 

 

the market for hard drives is also fragmenting into a variety of devices and products many industry analysts expect as do we that as content increasingly converts to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue to converge and hard drives will be found in many ce products other than computers in addition we expect that the consumer market for multimedia applications including audiovideo products incorporating high capacity and handheld consumer storage will continue to grow however because this market remains relatively new accurate forecasts for future growth remain challenging 

 

moreover some devices such as personal video recorders and digital video recorders or some new pc operating systems which allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality therefore allowing for greater market differentiation may require attributes not currently offered in our products resulting in a need to develop new interfaces form factors technical specifications or hard drive features increasing our overall operational expense without corresponding incremental revenue at this stage if we are not successful in continuing to deploy our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for the emerging ce market or if we are required to incur significant costs in developing such products it may harm our operating results 

 

our prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable enduser demand and oversupply of hard drives 

 

demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price competition if intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenue and gross margins 

 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

the hard drive industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts if our forecasts exceed actual market demand or if market demand decreases significantly from our forecasts then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if our forecasts do not meet actual market demand or if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts or beyond our ability to add 

manufacturing capacity then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

 

we also use forecasts in making decisions regarding investment of our resources for example as the hard drive industry transitions from the parallel advanced technology attachment “pata” interface to the sata interface we may invest more resources in the development of products using the sata interface if our forecasts regarding the replacement of the pata interface with the sata interface are inaccurate we may not have products available to meet our customers’ needs 

 

in addition although we receive forecasts from our customers they are not generally obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts in particular sales volumes in the distribution and retail channels are volatile and harder to predict than sales to our oem or odm customers we consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and our inventory requirements if we fail to accurately forecast our customers’ product demands we may have inadequate or excess inventory of our products or components which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

increases in areal density may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity which may lower the prices our customers are willing to pay for new products 

 

historically the industry has experienced periods of variable areal density growth rates when the rate of areal density growth increases the rate of increase may exceed the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity furthermore our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result of developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management or otherwise these factors could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with lower capacity hard drives at lower prices thereby decreasing our revenue as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity our asps could decline which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

expansion into new hard drive markets may cause our capital expenditures to increase and if we do not successfully expand into new markets our business may suffer 

 

to remain a significant supplier of hard drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch hard drives for the desktop enterprise ce and external storage markets and we also offer 25inch form factor hard drives for the mobile ce and external storage markets however demand for hard drives may shift to products in form factors or with interfaces that our competitors offer but which we do not expansion into other hard drive markets and resulting increases in manufacturing capacity requirements may require us to make substantial additional investments due in part because our operations are largely vertically integrated if we fail to successfully expand into new hard drive markets with products that we do not currently offer we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products 

 

if we fail to successfully manage our new product development or new market expansion or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with such development or expansion our business may suffer 

 

while we continue to develop new products and look to expand into other hard drive markets the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated with these new products and new markets such as 

 

 17 

 

further we need to identify how any of the hard drive markets into which we are expanding may have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently exist and properly address these differences these characteristics may include 

 

  

our business may suffer if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with our product development and market expansion for example our branded products are designed to attach to and interoperate with a wide variety of pc and ce devices and therefore their functionality is reliant on the manufacturer of such devices or the associated operating systems enabling the manufacturer’s devices to operate with our branded products if our branded products are not compatible with a wide variety of devices or if device manufacturers design their devices so that our branded products cannot operate with them and we cannot quickly and efficiently adapt our branded products to address these compatibility issues our business could suffer 

 

expanding into new hard drive markets exposes our business to different seasonal demand cycles which in turn could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the ce and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and volume demand cycles as compared to the pc market by expanding into these markets we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations that are different from and in addition to those of the pc market for example because the primary customer for products such as our branded products are individual consumers these markets experience a dramatic increase in demand during the winter holiday season if we do not properly adjust our supply to new demand cycles such as this we risk having excess inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient inventory during periods of high demand therefore adversely affecting our operating results 

 

if we do not predict the size and demands of the market for 25inch hard drives our business may suffer 

 

to continue to increase the sale of our 25inch hard drives in the mobile market we must predict and successfully adapt to the differences between the desktop and mobile markets such as different requirements features and competitors if we do not predict the size and demands of the markets for 25inch hard drives including the mobile market our business may suffer for example if a market that traditionally has used 35inch hard drives such as the desktop pc market shifts its volume demand to 25inch hard drives at a faster rate than we anticipate our ability to meet the demands of such market as well as the mobile market may be impaired which may cause our business to suffer 

 

selling to the retail market has become an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers for example computer superstores and ce stores and authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and online resellers our current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe we are facing increased competition from other companies for shelf space at a small number of major retailers that have strong buying power and pricing leverage if we fail to successfully maintain a customer preference for wd ® brand products or fail to successfully expand into multiple channels our operating results may be adversely affected we face strong competition in maintaining and trying to grow our market share in the retail market particularly because of the relatively low barriers to entry in this market for example several additional hard drive manufacturers have recently disclosed plans to expand into the external storage market and as these companies attempt to gain market share we may have difficulty in maintaining or growing our market share and there may be increased downward pressure on pricing we will continue to introduce new products in the retail market that incorporate our disk drives however there can be no assurance that these products will gain market acceptance and if they do not our operating results could suffer 

loss of market share with or by a key customer could harm our operating results 

 

during the year ended june 27 2008 a large percentage of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers which accounted for 47 of our revenue these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and may be able to cancel an order or terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship our operating results would likely be harmed in addition if customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue 

 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes 

 

higher capacity storage needs have typically been better served by magnetic hard drives than flash memory as hard drive manufacturers can offer better value at high capacities while lower capacity needs have been successfully served by solid state storage such as flash memory technology advances in magnetic optical semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products if we fail to be cost competitive against flash memory we could be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology 

 

further industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

 

the hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage additionally continued industry consolidation may lead to uncertainty in areas such as component availability which could negatively impact our cost structure 

 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken our operating results could suffer 

 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product if we fail to remain competitive in terms of our technology quality service and support our distribution customers may favor our competitors and our operating results could suffer we also face significant risk in the distribution market for hard drives if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference from white box to branded pcs or we experience significant price declines due to oversupply in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

the hard drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by significant shifts in market share among the major competitors 

 

the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence we also face competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory these factors taken together may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants in addition product recalls can lead to a loss of market share which could adversely affect our operating results 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard drive industry periodically sell hard drives at prices that we cannot profitably match 

 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to achieve profitability they periodically sell hard drives at lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss while still remaining profitable overall in addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonhard drive products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their hard drives at low prices our operating results may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers they may not purchase any units of a particular product line which would have a significant adverse impact on our sales 

 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the pc and ce markets if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could harm our competitive position these risks are increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current generation products 

 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability limitations 

 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our hard drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product in addition a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 

a low cost structure is critical to our operating results and increased costs may adversely affect our operating margin 

 

a low cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is critical to the success of our business and our operating results depend on our ability to maintain competitive cost structures on new and established products if our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost structure for manufacturing hard drives and we are unable to match their cost structure we could be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors 

 

shortages of commodity materials price volatility or use by other industries of materials used in the hard drive industry may increase our cost structure 

 

there are costs for certain commodity materials an increase of which increases our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives and key components shortages of materials such as stainless steel aluminum nickel neodymium ruthenium or platinum increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs for example in advance of the 2008 beijing summer olympics in seeking to minimize pollution the people’s republic of china shut down factories within a specified radius of beijing these factory shutdowns may cause a future shortage in materials we use in nickel plating of magnetic media causing prices to increase and adversely affecting our nickel plating costs additionally perpendicular recording technology requires increased usage of precious metals such as ruthenium and platinum the price of which may continue to be volatile which 

could adversely affect our operating margins furthermore if other high volume industries increase their demand for materials such as these our costs may further increase which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins the volatility in the cost of oil also affects our transportation costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass these increased costs through to our customers 

 

if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our major component suppliers our supply of critical components may be at risk and our profitability could suffer 

 

we make most of our own heads and media for some of our product families however we do not manufacture many of the component parts used in our hard drives as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our major component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers each of which employs variations on technology which can impact for example feasible combinations of heads and media components in august 2003 we settled litigation with a supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard drives as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our profitability was at risk until another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

 

violation of labor or environmental laws and practices by our suppliers or subsuppliers could harm our business 

 

we expect our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including labor and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct while our internal operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control our suppliers or subsuppliers or their labor or environmental practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by any of our suppliers or subsuppliers or divergence of a supplier’s or subsupplier’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us could harm our business by 

 

  

dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays lost revenue or increased costs 

 

certain components are available from a limited number of suppliers and we are sole sourced with some of these suppliers on certain products because we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain hard drive components and manufacturing equipment each of the following could significantly harm our operating results 

 

 21 

 

if components and equipment that we use are available from only a limited number of suppliers or are in short supply it may negatively impact our production and cause us to lose revenue 

 

our future operating results may also depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines in addition some of the components or component types used in our products are used in other devices such as mobile telephones and digital cameras if there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component or component type from several high volume industries resulting in a supply reduction or a component is otherwise in short supply or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic components or other necessary components we may experience production delays which could cause us loss of revenue if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

in addition certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or testing processes is available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment uses materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components 

 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components as a result we may be subject to cancellation charges if we cancel orders which may occur when we make technology transitions or when our component needs change in addition we have entered into contractual commitments with component suppliers and may enter into contractual commitments with other component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments require or may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components 

 

failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components for our products may adversely affect our operations 

 

we rely on suppliers for various component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves such as semiconductors motors flex circuits and suspensions some of these components must be specifically designed to be compatible for use in our products and are only available from a limited number of suppliers with whom we are sole sourced for certain products we are therefore dependent on the suppliers of these various components to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop technology that can be successfully integrated with our products and to manufacture these components efficiently the failure of component suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture technology that can be integrated into our products may cause us to experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment of hard drive products or our expansion into new technology and markets therefore adversely affecting our business and financial results 

 

there are certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy to vertically integrate our operations 

 

our vertical integration of head and media manufacturing resulted in a fundamental change in our operating structure as we now manufacture heads and media for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture consequently we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than assumed in our prior financial business model if the overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our operating results we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization 

including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves 

 

in addition we may incur additional risks including 

 

  

if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

 

if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and media with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

under our business plan we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads and media used in some of the hard drive products we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head and media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads or media we manufacture in addition we may not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs which would negatively impact our business and financial results 

 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

 

if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product if product life cycles shorten it may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results in addition shortening of product life cycles also make it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to increase areal density we may fail to remain competitive 

 

new products in the hard drive market typically require higher areal densities than previous product generations posing formidable technical and manufacturing challenges higher areal densities require existing head and media technology to be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on a single disk in addition our introduction of new products during a technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns our failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust its designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive there are some technologies such as currentperpendiculartoplane “cpp” and heat assisted magnetic recording “hamr” discrete track recording “dtr” and other similar potentially break through technology that will represent revolutionary recording technologies if they can be implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis ahead of the industry which could put us at a competitive disadvantage as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire for example new recording technology requires changes in the manufacturing process of heads and media which may cause longer production times and reduce the overall availability of media in the industry additionally the new technology requires a greater degree of integration between heads and media which may lengthen our time of development of hard drives using this technology furthermore as we attempt to develop and implement new technologies we may become more dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components that accommodate the new technology these results would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however because increasing areal density has become more difficult in the hard drive industry such increases may require increases in component costs and other opportunities to reduce costs may not continue at historical rates additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gb per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we do not properly manage the technology transitions of our products our operating results may be negatively affected 

 

many of the markets in which we offer our products are undergoing technology transitions for example in order to handle higher data transfer rates the pc and enterprise markets are transitioning from parallel interfaces such as pata and scsi to serial interfaces such as sata and sas respectively we must effectively manage the transition of the features of our products to serial interfaces in order to remain competitive and cost effective in the pc market we currently offer pata and sata products and must timely and efficiently manage both our manufacture of pata products through their end of life and our ramp of sata products and features if we fail to successfully manage the transition from parallel interfaces to serial interfaces our operating results may suffer 

 

our highvolume hard drive and media manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers are concentrated in asia which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of any of these facilities and localized risks to employees in these locations 

 

our highvolume hard drive and media manufacturing facilities are in malaysia and thailand and the manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers are in asia a condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage or a fire flood earthquake or other disaster that adversely affects any of these facilities or our ability to manufacture could limit the total volume of hard drives we are able to manufacture and result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results similarly a localized health risk affecting our employees or the staff of our suppliers such as a new pandemic influenza in asia could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture 

our head manufacturing operations include a single wafer fabrication facility in california and a single head gimbal assembly facility in thailand and our media operations include four facilities in malaysia which subjects us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at any of these facilities are disrupted 

 

as we have previously discussed in public statements our business plan presently contemplates that we will design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads and media required for the hard drives we manufacture we fabricate wafers in our fremont california facility and the wafers are then sent to our thailand facility for slider fabrication and wafer slicing and hga assembly and testing additionally we manufacture the majority of our media and substrates in four facilities in penang johor and sarawak malaysia a fire flood earthquake or other disaster condition or event such as a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities would significantly affect supply of our heads or media and limit our ability to manufacture hard drives which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results 

 

our operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to optimize the overall quality timetomarket and timetovolume of new and established products 

 

to achieve consistent success with our customers we must balance several key attributes such as timetomarket timetovolume quality cost service price and a broad product portfolio our operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to 

 

  

manufacturing and marketing our products abroad subjects us to numerous risks 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations and foreign marketing efforts including 

 

 25 

 

  

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

 

we ship the majority of our products to our various customers via air freight the sudden unavailability of air cargo operations used to ship our products would impair our ability to deliver our products in a timely and efficient manner which could adversely impact our operating results we also ship a portion of our product via ocean freight and events or conditions at shipping ports such as labor difficulties or disputes could also impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver these products 

 

we are vulnerable to system failures which could harm our business 

 

we are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure among other functions to operate our factories sell our products fulfill orders manage inventory and bill collect and make payments our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks and other events our business is also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees despite any precautions we may take such problems could result in among other consequences interruptions in our business which could harm our reputation and financial condition 

 

we may be unable to retain our key staff and skilled employees 

 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation if we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 

 

the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award 

equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology despite safeguards to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

 

environmental regulation costs could harm our operating results 

 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate for example the european union has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” directive which prohibits the use of certain substances in electronic equipment and the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive which obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to takeback and properly dispose of the equipment similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products we will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our component suppliers also timely comply with such laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations we could incur substantial costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws we could be subject to governmental fines and liability to our customers if we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws or if we are subject to significant expenses in connection with a violation of these laws our financial condition or operating results could suffer 

 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

 

because we manufacture our products abroad our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the thai baht and of the malaysian ringgit may negatively impact our operating results 

 

the thai baht is a free floating currency while the malaysian ringgit exchange rate policy is one of a managed float we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place currently we hedge the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and british pound sterling with forward contracts 

 

if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs 

 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately assess the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

negative conditions in the credit markets could result in a decrease in sales and lower revenue in the distribution channel 

 

many of our customers in the distribution channel rely on credit financing in order to purchase our products if the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit product orders in the distribution channel may decrease which could result in lower revenue 

 

inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly results 

 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

  

rapidly changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to predict actual results 

 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

 28 

 

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio 

 

our longterm investments consist of auctionrate securities totaling 28 million as of june 27 2008 the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auctionrate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities if the credit market does not improve auctions for our invested amounts may fail if an auction fails for securities in which we have invested we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auctionrate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities in the event we need or desire to access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss for example during the year ended june 27 2008 the market values of some of the auctionrate securities we owned were impacted by the macroeconomic credit market conditions and as a result we recognized 10 million of otherthantemporary losses to mark the remaining investments to estimated market value further rating downgrades of the security issuer or the thirdparties insuring such investments may require us to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an additional impairment charge 

 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 

 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 27 2008 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal control over financial reporting was effective we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods however if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which may adversely affect our financial results or our stock price

our company 

 

we design develop manufacture and sell hard drives a hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks “media” to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are key components of computers including desktop and notebook computers “pcs” data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic “ce” devices 

 

we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and original design manufacturers “odms” for use in computer systems subsystems or ce devices and to distributors resellers and retailers our hard drives are used in desktop computers notebook computers and enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage storage area networks and video surveillance equipment additionally our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” we also sell our hard drives as standalone storage products and integrate them into external casings embedding application software and presenting them as our own wd ® branded external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of music photographs video and other digital data 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device our hard drives currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes “gb” to 1 terabyte “tb” nominal rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including both enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” and serial advanced technology attachment “sata” we also embed our hard drives into wdbranded external storage appliances that utilize interfaces such as usb 20 external sata “esata” firewire tm and ethernet network connections in addition we recently announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives 

 

we manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies “hsas” in malaysia and thailand we also design and manufacture most of our required magnetic heads in california and head gimbal assemblies “hgas” in thailand and we design in california and manufacture in malaysia most of our required media and substrates 

 

on september 5 2007 we completed our acquisition the “acquisition” of komag incorporated “komag” through a cash tender offer by state m corporation “state m” our indirect whollyowned subsidiary for all outstanding shares of komag’s common stock which was followed by a merger of state m and komag the “merger” whereby komag became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary and changed its name to wd media inc the acquisition has strengthened our production efficiencies and improved our access to and control of technology and competitive position in the worldwide hard drive industry while enhancing our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating media the aggregate purchase price for komag was approximately 1 billion consisting of cash paid for outstanding shares transaction fees severance and other employeerelated equity payments 

 

results of operations 

 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles operating results for komag prior to the date of the acquisition september 5 2007 including the first two months of fiscal 2008 and the fiscal years 2007 and 2006 are not included in our operating results and are therefore not discussed accordingly 2008 revenues and expenses reflect the addition of results from our media operations since the date of the acquisition while the 2007 and 2006 results do not include operating results for komag prior to the date of the acquisition this affects our discussion of changes in our revenues and expenses comparing these periods in connection with the acquisition we incurred charges for inprocess research and development and transition costs which impacted our earnings in 2008 

 

fiscal 2008 overview 

 

in 2008 our net revenue increased by 48 to 81 billion on shipments of 133 million units as compared to 55 billion and 97 million units respectively in 2007 in 2008 56 of our hard drive revenue was derived from nondesktop sources including ce products enterprise applications notebook computers and retail sales as compared to 43 in 2007 gross margin percentage increased to 215 from 165 in 2007 and operating income increased by 591 million to 10 billion as a percentage of net revenue operating income was 124 in 2008 compared to 76 in 2007 net income in 2008 was 867 million or 384 per diluted share compared to 564 million or 250 per diluted share in 2007 we successfully completed our acquisition of komag and have completed the integration of the media operation which is generating technology and cost contributions to the overall business

fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 

 

net revenue net revenue was 81 billion for 2008 an increase of 48 from 2007 total unit shipments increased to 133 million as compared to 97 million for the prior year this unit increase resulted from an increase in higher overall demand for hard drives and our continuing diversification into nondesktop markets including mobile consumer electronics enterprise and branded products for example we shipped 37 million 25 inch drives to the mobile and branded markets in 2008 as compared to 12 million units in 2007 additionally we shipped 15 million units to the dvr market in 2008 as compared to 10 million units in 2007 asps increased to 59 due to an improved mix of revenues by market category improved product mix and more favorable demandsupply conditions changes in revenue by geography generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as well as an increase in mobile drives sold to asia changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of mobile hard drives to 

oems and an increase in sales of branded products due to the growing worldwide acceptance of our my passport ® and my book ® external digital storage appliances 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2008 was 17 billion an increase of 839 million or 93 over the prior year gross margin percentage increased to 215 in 2008 from 165 in 2007 the factors contributing to this increase were an improved mix of revenues by market category improved product mix and more favorable demandsupply conditions our manufacturing throughput and costs also improved through operational efficiencies higher utilization and a higher mix of products based on newer more costeffective technologies and the contribution of media operations 

 

operating expenses total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” decreased to 85 of net revenue in 2008 compared to 89 in 2007 rd expense was 464 million in 2008 an increase of 158 million or 52 over the prior year this increase in rd expense includes 75 million relating to the acquired media operations 52 million related to product development to support new programs and 31 million in incentive and equity compensation as a percentage of net revenue rd expense remained consistent at 57 in 2008 compared to 56 in 2007 sga expense was 220 million in 2008 an increase of 41 million or 23 as compared to 2007 this increase in sga expense includes 28 million for the expansion of sales and marketing to support new products and 13 million in higher incentive and equity compensation as a percentage of net revenue sga expense decreased to 27 in 2008 from 33 in 2007 primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

during 2008 we recorded a 49 million charge to operating expense related to an inprocess research and development project acquired from komag involving technology for higher recording densities on advanced perpendicular recording media as these advanced products were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use the fair value of the development effort did not qualify for capitalization and was immediately expensed for additional information regarding acquired inprocess research and development see part ii item 8 note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

interest and other income expense net interest and other expense was 25 million in 2008 compared to net interest and other income of 28 million in 2007 this decrease is a result of higher debt balances and realized and recognized losses on investments of 13 million 

 

income tax expense benefit income tax expense was 114 million in 2008 compared to an income tax benefit of 121 million in 2007 tax provision as a percentage of income before taxes was 12 in 2008 compared to tax benefit as a percentage of income of 27 for 2007 differences between the effective tax rates and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive programs and the current year generation of income tax credits we have tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various times through 2022 in 2008 income tax expense also includes net charges of 75 million for taxes related to the license of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary in 2007 the tax provision was impacted by a favorable adjustment to the company’s valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 126 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 we reversed the remaining valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based upon a determination that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in future years the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or company conditions 

 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” as of june 30 2007 as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognized no adjustment in the net liability for unrecognized tax benefits the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption of fin 48 was 58 million all of which would affect our effective tax rate if realized during the year ended june 27 2008 we recognized a 17 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and recorded 32 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to komag as of june 27 2008 we had approximately 107 million of unrecognized tax benefits which included the 32 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to komag 

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

 

net revenue net revenue was 55 billion for 2007 an increase of 26 from 2006 total unit shipments increased to 97 million as compared to 73 million for the prior year this unit increase resulted from an increase in our desktop pc market share stronger overall demand for hard drives in the desktop pc market and our increasing focus on the nondesktop market including mobile ce enterprise and branded products for example we shipped 12 million drives to the mobile market in 2007 as compared to 5 million units in 2006 additionally we shipped 10 million units to the dvr market in 2007 as compared to 7 million units in 2006 asps declined to 57 due to normal technology price declines and a more competitive pricing environment in the notebook desktop and consumer electronics markets changes in revenue by geography generally reflect overall market demand fluctuations for hard drives changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of branded products due to the growing worldwide acceptance of our my passport ® and my book ® external digital storage appliances 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2007 was 900 million an increase of 71 million or 9 over the prior year gross margin percentage decreased to 165 in 2007 from 191 in 2006 the factors contributing to this decrease include normal technology price declines and a more competitive pricing environment in the notebook desktop and consumer electronics markets in addition gross margin in 2006 benefited from a more favorable supplydemand balance 

 

operating expenses total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses decreased to 89 of net revenue in 2007 compared to 107 in 2006 rd expense was 306 million in 2007 an increase of 9 million or 3 over the prior year the increase in rd expense was primarily related to the development of new product platforms in support of our entry into new markets and expenditures for advanced head technologies partially offset by a decrease of 2 million in variable incentive compensation programs sga expense was 179 million in 2007 an increase of 13 million or 8 as compared to 2006 the increase in sga expense was primarily due to an increase of 19 million in stock based compensation expense and other longterm employee incentive programs offset by a 5 million decrease in software writeoffs that occurred in 2006 

 

interest and other income net interest and other income was 28 million and 16 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash and shortterm investment balances 

 

income tax benefit income tax benefit was 121 million and 13 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes was 27 and 3 for 2007 and 2006 respectively differences between the effective tax rates and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive programs and reductions to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we have tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various times through 2022 in addition to the tax holidays the tax provision was impacted by favorable adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 126 and 22 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively these adjustments were based upon a determination that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized in the fourth quarter of 2007 we reversed the remaining valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence including our history of cumulative pretax income and the increased likelihood of our ability to generate profits in the future in 2006 we released a portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets due to the difficulty at the time in accurately projecting income for periods of longer than two years given the cyclical nature of our industry the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in future years the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or company conditions 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we ended 2008 with total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 11 billion an increase of 200 million from june 29 2007 our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and 

liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds the following table summarizes the results of our statements of cash flows for the three years ended june 27 2008 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 was 14 billion as compared to 618 million for 2007 and 368 million for 2006 cash flow from operations consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash provided by changes in working capital was 22 million for 2008 as compared to 78 million and 207 million used to fund working capital for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

our working capital requirements primarily depend upon the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales the following table summarizes the cash conversion cycle for the three years ended 2008 

 

 

 

the decrease in the cash conversion cycle for 2008 was primarily due to our days in inventory “dios” which increased by 7 days from 2007 this increase was primarily due to an increase in our inventory onhand as a result of our acquisition of komag which requires us to hold precious metals to be used in the production of recording media the 1 day increase in days sales outstanding “dsos” is primarily a result of changes in customer mix 

 

from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make these modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment modifications through negotiations with or by granting to or receiving from our vendors payment term accommodations 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities for 2008 was 13 billion as compared to 383 million for 2007 and 303 million for 2006 during 2008 cash used in investing activities consisted of 927 million for acquisitions and 615 million for capital expenditures partially offset by cash provided by investments of 221 million during 2007 cash used in investing activities consisted of 324 million for capital expenditures and 59 million for investments the increase in capital expenditures in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily consisted of the ongoing conversion of our head wafer fabrication facilities to utilizing 8inch wafers from 6inch wafers continued investment in advanced head technologies increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio and continued investment in media equipment as a result of the acquisition the increase in capital expenditures in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily a result of equipment purchased to support our investments in advanced head technologies new product platforms and capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio 

for 2009 we expect capital additions to be approximately 800 million depreciation and amortization for 2009 is expected to be approximately 475 million

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of june 27 2008 in millions 

 

 

longterm debt 

 

on february 11 2008 western digital technologies inc “wdti” a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into a fiveyear credit agreement the “credit facility” with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent citigroup global markets inc as syndication agent jp morgan securities inc and citigroup global markets inc as arrangers and bank of america na hsbc bank usa national association and the royal bank of scotland plc as codocumentation agents and lenders party thereto 

 

the credit facility provides for a 750 million unsecured loan consisting of a 500 million term loan facility and a 250 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline in addition wdti may elect to expand the credit facility by up to 250 million if existing or new lenders provide additional term or revolving commitments 

 

the 750 million available under the credit facility was borrowed on february 11 2008 and was used together with additional cash from the accounts of wdti to repay in full the 760 million previously borrowed under a bridge facility that had been used to fund the acquisition as of june 27 2008 the company repaid the amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility leaving 250 million available for future borrowings 

 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of wdti either a a libor rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs the “eurocurrency rate” or b a base rate determined by reference to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 and ii the prime rate as announced by jpmorgan chase bank na the “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility ranges from 125 to 150 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margin for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 08 to 1125 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis the interest rate at june 27 2008 was 375 

 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the credit facility wdti is required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the aggregate revolving commitments thereunder the facility fee rate ranges from 020 to 0375 per annum and is determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis wdti is also required to pay letter of credit fees a to the revolving credit facility lenders on the aggregate face amount of all outstanding letters of credit equal to an applicable margin in effect with respect to the eurocurrency rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility and b to the letter of credit issuer computed at a rate equal to 0125 per annum on the face amount of the letter of credit plus such letter of credit issuer’s customary documentary and processing fees and charges 

 

beginning on june 30 2009 wdti is required under the term loan facility to make regularly scheduled payments of principal in quarterly installments equal to a percentage of the original principal amount of the term loan as follows 375 per quarter for each of the four quarters ended june 30 2009 september 30 2009 december 31 2009 and march 31 2010 5 per quarter for each of the four quarters ended june 30 2010 september 30 2010 december 31 2010 and march 31 2011 625 per quarter for each of the four quarters ended june 30 2011 september 30 2011 december 31 2011 and march 31 2012 and 10 per quarter for each of the three quarters ended june 30 2012 september 30 2012 and december 31 2012 with the balance due and payable at maturity on february 11 2013

the obligations of wdti under the credit facility are guaranteed by the company and wdti’s whollyowned subsidiary wd media 

 

purchase orders 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or workinprocess 

 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers which contain minimum quantity requirements however the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered achievement of predefined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above 

 

we enter into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to these commitments 

 

forward exchange contracts 

 

we purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for our current forward exchange contract commitments 

 

indemnifications 

 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements products or services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

as announced on november 21 2005 our board of directors previously authorized us to repurchase 250 million of our common stock in open market transactions since the inception of this stock repurchase program through june 27 2008 we have repurchased 17 million shares for a total cost of 248 million including commissions in april 2008 our board of directors authorized a 500 million increase to repurchase our common stock in open market transactions through march 31 2013 we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow 

 

we believe our current cash cash equivalents and other sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the foreseeable future our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

 

revenue and accounts receivable 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other incentive programs in accordance with current accounting standards we recognize revenue upon delivery to oems odms and resellers and record a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers we base these adjustments on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers as well as historical pricing information if endmarket demand for hard drives declines significantly we may have to increase sellthrough incentive payments to resellers resulting in an increase in our allowances which could adversely impact operating results 

 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could affect operating results 

 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could negatively affect operating results 

 

warranty 

 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for periods of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help with our estimates and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

inventory 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout and weighted average methods or net realizable value weightedaverage cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us we have determined that it is less practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metal and as such we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weightedaverage cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in 

production the weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a firstin firstout method we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require a write down of inventory that could negatively affect operating results 

 

litigation and other contingencies 

 

we apply sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies accordingly we disclose contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when in consultation with our legal advisors we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable refer to part ii item 8 note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss “nol” and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed in fin 48 to the extent a tax position does not meet a morelikelythannot level of certainty no benefit is recognized in the financial statements if a position meets the morelikelythannot level of certainty it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes the actual liability for unrealized tax benefit in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for all stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” under these provisions stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the fair values of all stock options granted are estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all employee stock purchase plan “espp” shares are estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions under sfas 123r we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities it also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies whenever other standards 

require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances but provides clarification on acceptable fair valuation methods and applications sfas 157 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years which is the first quarter of our fiscal year 2009 on november 14 2007 the fasb provided a one year deferral for the adoption of sfas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 which is the first quarter of our fiscal year 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 which is the first quarter of our fiscal year 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 141r will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activitiesan amendment of fasb statement no 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 updates guidance regarding disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities it responds to constituents’ concerns that fasb statement no 133 does not provide adequate information about how derivative and hedging activities affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the disclosure of fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format as required by sfas 161 should provide a more complete picture of the location in an entity’s financial statements of both the derivative positions existing at period end and the effect of using derivatives during the reporting period sfas 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim period beginning after november 15 2008 which is the first quarter of our fiscal year 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 161 will have on our consolidated financial statements

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

 

although the majority of our transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies we purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations the contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months we do not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes currently we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and the british pound sterling malaysian ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges euro and british pound sterling contracts are designated as fair value hedges thai baht contracts are designated as both cash flow and fair value hedges see part ii item 8 note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

as of june 27 2008 we had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

 

 

 

 

  

in 2008 2007 and 2006 total net realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

 

disclosure about other market risks 

 

variable interest rate risk 

 

borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to at the option of wdti either a a libor rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs the “eurocurrency rate” or b a base rate determined by reference to the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 and ii the prime rate as announced by jpmorgan chase bank na the “base rate” in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility ranges from 125 to 150 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margin for revolving loan borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 08 to 1125 with respect to borrowings at the eurocurrency rate and 00 to 0125 with respect to borrowings at the base rate the applicable margins for borrowings under the credit facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis if either the base rate or libor rate increase our interest payments would also increase a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the credit facility would increase interest expense by approximately 5 million annually 

 

credit market risk 

 

our longterm investments consist of auctionrate securities totaling 28 million as of june 27 2008 the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented us from liquidating some of our holdings of auctionrate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities if the credit market does not improve auctions for our invested amounts may continue to fail if this occurs we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auctionrate securities at par should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities prior to maturity of the underlying assets in the event we need or desire to access these funds we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par we may incur a loss the market values of some of the auctionrate securities we owned were impacted by the macroeconomic credit market conditions rating downgrades of the security issuer or the thirdparties insuring such investments may require us to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge based on our ability to access our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting see page 48 herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 27 2008 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our chief executive officer and its chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

general 

 

we design develop manufacture and sell hard drives a hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are key components of computers including desktop and notebook computers “pcs” data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic “ce” devices 

 

we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and original design manufactures “odms” for use in computer systems subsystems or ce devices and to distributors resellers and retailers our hard drives are used in desktop computers notebook computers and enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage storage area networks and video surveillance equipment additionally our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” we also sell our hard drives as standalone storage products and integrate them into our own wdbranded external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music photography video and other data 

 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device our hard drives currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes “gb” to 1 terabyte “tb” nominal rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including both enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” and serial advanced technology attachment “sata” we also embed our hard drives into wdbranded external storage appliances that utilize interfaces such as usb 20 external sata firewire tm and ethernet network connections in addition we recently announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than previous designs 

 

we manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies “hsas” in malaysia and thailand we also design and manufacture a substantial portion of our required magnetic heads in california and head gimbal assemblies “hgas” in thailand following our planned acquisition of komag incorporated “komag” a leading media manufacturer and one of our current suppliers we will also design in california and manufacture in malaysia most of our required media and substrates for geographical financial data see part ii item 8 note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

on june 28 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of komag for a value of approximately 10 billion the planned acquisition of komag is intended to strengthen our production efficiencies and enhance our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating media the planned acquisition is structured as a cash tender offer at 3225 per share for all the outstanding shares of komag common stock followed by a merger of our indirect whollyowned subsidiary into komag in which the remaining shareholders of komag will receive 3225 in cash per share the planned acquisition is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2007 we intend to fund the planned acquisition including the expected repurchase of komag’s convertible notes due 2014 and related fees and expenses through a combination of cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term bridge loan facility of up to 13 billion 

 

business strategy 

 

our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of reliable high quality hard drives at a low total cost of ownership and with high efficiency we believe this strategy helps accomplish the following 

 

  

we have designed our business strategy to accommodate significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high asset utilization 

industry 

 

we develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop mobile pc enterprise ce and branded product retail markets we believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has outpaced growth in the sales of all pcs over the past five years based on industry data in calendar 2001 there were approximately 50 more hard drives sold in the market than pcs in contrast in calendar 2006 there were approximately 79 more hard drives sold in the market than pcs we believe the following factors primarily drive this accelerating growth of hard drive sales in addition to pc applications 

 

  

additionally we believe that the demand for 25inch hard drives has grown from approximately 16 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2003 to 34 of the overall hard drive market in calendar 2006 

 

these factors and our product expansion strategy in the last three years have gradually increased our percentage of revenue derived from nondesktop sources in 2007 57 of our revenue was from desktop computers and 43 was from nondesktop sources compared to 71 of our revenue from desktop computers and 29 from nondesktop sources in 2006

desktop market 

 

the desktop market consists of the overall hard drive market for desktop computers individuals use desktop computers in homes businesses and multiuser networks desktop computers use software applications for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and for other needs hard drives store desktop computer operating system and application software as well as the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop market has grown in part due to 

 

  

we believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop computer unit growth including maturing desktop markets in north america and western europe an increase in firsttime buyers of desktop computers in asia eastern europe and latin america and the lengthening of desktop computer replacement cycles 

 

mobile pc market 

 

the mobile pc market consists primarily of notebook computers individuals use notebook computers both in and away from homes and businesses like desktop computers notebook computers use software applications for various needs and hard drives store notebook operating system and application software and the data used by the applications 

 

we believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile pc market has grown in part due to 

 

 5 

 

  

we expect the mobile pc market to continue to grow faster than the desktop or enterprise markets in the next three years as the mobile pc market continues to evolve to a higher volume market we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on attributes such as quality reliability execution flexibility and competitive cost structures of their hard drive suppliers these are the same attributes that have mattered for many years to customers in the highvolume desktop market 

 

enterprise market 

 

the enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations servers network attached storage storage area networks other computing systems or subsystems and video surveillance historically hard drives for this market have utilized several interfaces including the small computer systems interface “scsi” and fibre channel arbitrated loop “fcal” beginning in 2003 these traditional enterprise interfaces have been supplemented or have been replaced in certain storage applications by hard drives featuring the sata interface technology which is supported by industry standards as well as by serial attached scsi “sas” sata hard drives typically cost customers less than scsi hard drives while offering higher capacities and maintaining similar reliability scalability and performance 

 

we believe that enterprise uses of sata hard drives will continue to increase during the past few years a new diskbased backup application has emerged with highcapacity sata hard drives augmenting scsi hard drives tape and optical media this new application popularly referred to as “nearline” storage has created a growth market because hard drives backup or access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions and quickly retrieve critical backup or nearline data the availability of sata hard drive solutions which are more cost effective than scsi hard drives promotes the increasing use of highcapacity hard drives in nearline storage applications the low price per capacity of sata drives has stimulated new applications such as video surveillance video editingbroadcasting and medical imaging these applications represent segments of a growing market for high capacity storage in noncomputing imaging and multimedia professions 

 

enterpriseclass sata drives are becoming commonplace for it infrastructure applications such as databases scientific computing web content web caching web search engines and electronic mail these applications have become an important market for highcapacity sata hard drives we believe that this market will consume a growing portion of the highest capacity hard drives in the next three years 

 

sas is the next generation scsi technology and is expected to replace scsi drives over the next few years sata technology is compatible with sas technology enabling customers the flexibility of incorporating sata hard drives in sas storage systems we believe the market transition from scsi to sas will add to the growth of the enterpriseclass sata market which currently is estimated to be more than 30 of the enterprise hard drive market 

 

highperformance applications such as blade servers are increasingly using 25inch form factor hard drives supplanting traditional 35inch drives smaller form factors enable more drives per physical space for increased performance high capacity per square foot and low power consumption this trend demonstrates the fragmentation of the enterprise hard drive market and the need for applicationspecific enterpriseclass hard drives 

 

consumer electronics market 

 

the use of hard drives in ce products has been a major growth area in recent years currently the three largest segments of this market are 

 

 6 

 

since 1999 dvrs have been available for use in home entertainment systems and they offer enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program additionally digital video disk “dvd” recorders increasingly incorporate hard drives to allow for dvr functionality and faster recording of content onto removable dvds the market for these products favors larger capacity hard drives and continues to grow in japan north america and europe additionally the rest of asia pacific shows strong interest in this market we believe growth in this market will continue to build demand for higher capacity hard drives 

 

the proliferation in the ce market of more sophisticated mobile devices including cell phones and mp3 players is driving the delivery of diverse content from hard drive intensive hosts we believe this is one of the factors influencing increased sales of enterpriseclass sata drives we also believe that multimedia handheld devices such video cameras and highresolution still cameras are enabling consumer production of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of small formfactor hard drive storage 

 

hard drives with 18inch or 10inch form factors primarily address the consumer handheld device and portable external storage markets the majority of hard drives used in portable media players that play both digital audio and video content are 18inch form factors currently we believe the markets for these handheld devices are better served by flash memory as opposed to rotating magnetic storage 

 

external hard drive market 

 

most new pc systems include highspeed external interfaces such as usb 20 external sata firewire tm or ethernet network connections that permit users to supplement the storage space of their pc systems or home and small office networks with the use of external hard drives users store additional programs or multimedia content and back up internal hard drives with external hard drives as well as mobile external hard drives for mobility convenience although external hard drives are a small part of the overall hard drive market we believe that sales will continue to grow external storage can often be the easiest quickest or only way of adding additional storage capacity to either a desktop or notebook computer we believe there is an increasing consumer awareness of the need and value of securely storing personal digital content through backup applications and devices in addition there is opportunity for external storage as a way of expanding storage capacity in ce devices such as dvrs 

 

other market opportunities 

 

we regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve based on significant investments we made over the last four years we believe we now have the technology building blocks to increase our overall market penetration and be a fullline hard drive supplier consistent with our measured and deliberate approach to new market entries in the recent past our approach to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment of the risks rewards requirements and profit potential of such actions 

 

products 

 

we offer a broad line of hard drives designed for various markets we market our hard drives under brand names including wd caviar ®  wd raptor ®  wd scorpio ®  wd passport ®  my book tm  my dvr expander tm and greenpower tm  these hard drives service the desktop mobile enterprise ce and branded products markets and can be found in products including desktop computers notebook computers enterprise storage workstations video surveillance equipment networking products dvrs stbs and external storage appliances 

 

desktop hard drive products 

 

our hard drives designed for the desktop market currently consist of 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 40 gb to 1 tb these products utilize either the eide or sata interfaces providing high performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection the type of eide interface currently used in our hard drives is ata100 which signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second which is the maximum specified data transition that can be sustained under ideal conditions the sata interface available in many of our hard drives enable burst transfer rates of up to 300 megabytes per second 

mobile hard drive products 

 

our hard drives used in mobile products typically include 25inch form factor drives for notebook computers although the desktop market accounts for a majority of hard drive sales unit shipments of hard drives for notebook computers represent a growing share of the total we entered the 25inch mobile market in september 2004 we are now shipping our fourth generation of the wd scorpio ® product family offering up to 250 gb of capacity our product expansion has enabled us to provide customers with a fullline of 25inch mobile drives and helped us enhance our market position in this fastgrowing market 

 

enterprise hard drive products 

 

we offer multiple product lines to address enterprise market needs including 

 

  

both wd raptor ® and wd re drives may be used in but are not limited to applications such as databases ecommerce and super computing in life science oil and gas and similar industries business records management email file serving web serving nearline storage medical records engineering data management video broadcasting and video security 

 

consumer electronics products 

 

we offer a line of hard drives under the wd av brand that are designed for use in products such as dvrs stbs karaoke systems multifunction printers and gaming systems wd av drives deliver the characteristics ce manufacturers seek most which are quiet operation low temperature low power consumption specifications high reliability and optimized streaming capabilities 

 

branded products 

 

we sell a broad line of wdbranded hard drivebased storage appliances which are internal drives embedded into pc peripheralstyle enclosures that have usb 20 external sata firewire tm and ethernet network connections and include software that assists customers with back up remote access and management of digital content we sell these branded storage appliances as well as related adapters through retail store fronts online stores and distributors these include 

 

  

research and development 

 

we devote substantial resources to development of new products and improvement of existing products we focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses totaled 306 million 297 million and 240 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

for further discussion of risks related to our development of new products see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

technology and product development 

 

hard drives record store and retrieve digital data performance attributes of hard drives such as their ability to access and transmit data and storage capacity are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical hard drives and tapes and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard drive performance include 

 

  

all of our hard drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard drive are a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board the head disk assembly includes heads media disks head positioning mechanism actuator and spindle motor a rigid base and top cover contain these components in a contaminationcontrolled environment the printed circuit board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector 

 

one or more disks positioned around a motordriven spindle hub that rotates the disks comprise the head disk assembly a thin coating of magnetic materials applied to a smooth substrate make the disk each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

 

the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks divided into sectors the computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the head stack assembly pivots and swings across the disk by a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

 

industry standard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interfaces for pcs are eide and sata and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems are scsi sata sas and fcal as computer performance continues to improve the hard drive will need to deliver information faster we believe this will continue to drive the pc industry transition to higher speed interfaces such as sata to handle the higher data transfer rates we currently offer our wd caviar ® and wd caviar ® greenpower tm “gp” drives with the sata interface featuring capacities as large as 750 gb and 1 tb respectively we design these products for the pc workstation and external storage markets we currently offer our wd raptor ®  a 10000 rpm enterpriseclass drive with the sata interface and the wd re 7200 rpm drives manufactured to enterpriseclass standards and available with a sata interface 

 

the number of disks and each disk’s areal density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk determines storage capacity of the hard drive the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter achieving a given drive capacity requires fewer disks as the areal density increases potentially reducing product costs over time through reduced component requirements beginning in june 

2007 we began shipping 35inch hard drives with 188 gb per platter areal density and 25inch hard drives with 125 gb per platter areal density in july 2007 we introduced the wd cavier ® gp 35inch hard drive which has 250 gb per platter areal density 

 

head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density historically there have been rapid technological changes resulting in several generations of head technology in a relatively short time however in recent years the time has lengthened between changes in generations of head technology the hard drive industry is in the midst of a transition from the use of giant magnetoresistive head technology for the head writer function to perpendicular recording “pmr” technology which allows for significantly higher storage capacities in addition the industry is making the transition to tunnel injunctive magneto resistive “tmr” technology for the head reader function we have essentially completed the transition to pmr and tmr in our 25inch products and we are in the midst of these transitions in our 35inch products 

 

the wd product line generally leverages a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families and in some cases across product families which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower costs through purchasing economies this platform strategy also enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models 

 

in addition to the development of hard drives we invest considerable resources in the development of head technology used in the majority of our hard drive products and we anticipate investing considerable resources in the development of media technology following our planned acquisition of komag the design and manufacturing of wd heads consists of engineering and fabricating a read element for reading data from media a write element for writing data to media and slider the slider functions like an airplane wing and allows the read and write elements to fly over the surface of media and to land on either the media or a special ramp when power is not applied to the hard drive 

 

fiscal 2007 represented the fifth consecutive year of substantial growth in our research and development and capital spending to support our significant broadening of our product and technology portfolios over that fiveyear period we have grown our investment spending over 270 from 170 million in fiscal 2002 to approximately 630 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of this investment activity we continue to expand our business beyond the desktop market into newer markets or markets in which we have not previously participated such investments have allowed us to execute against our strategic objective of revenue diversification to address the growth of new applications for hard drives and fastgrowing new market opportunities 

 

we are currently expanding our existing head wafer fabrication facilities to accommodate our anticipated growth the expansion will involve a process change to utilize 80inch wafers from 60inch wafers and will cost an estimated 400 million in the fiscal 2008 to 2010 timeframe this will be in addition to our ongoing capital expenditures for hard drive and head assembly and our anticipated capital expenditures for media development and manufacturing following our planned acquisition of komag

sales and distribution 

 

we sell our products globally to oems odms distributors and retailers oems purchase our hard drives either directly or through a contract manufacturer such as an odm and assemble them into the computer or other ce systems they build distributors typically sell our hard drives to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers retailers typically sell our hard drive products directly to endusers through their storefront or online facilities 

 

original equipment manufacturers 

 

sales to oems which include sales through odms accounted for 48 54 and 58 of our revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively during 2007 our largest oem customer was dell during 2007 2006 and 2005 sales to dell accounted for 10 12 and 16 respectively of our revenue we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our strong relationships with the leading oems 

oems evaluate and select their hard drive suppliers based on a number of factors including quality and reliability storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability they typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of hard drives and once an oem has chosen its qualified hard drive vendors for a given product it generally will purchase hard drives from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with oem qualifications a hard drive supplier must consistently offer hard drives featuring leading technology quality and reliability at acceptable capacity per disk suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of each new generation of high quality and reliable hard drives requiring access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities 

 

many of our oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” in which they do not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” in which the oem contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer such as an odm who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the oem’s instructions for certain oems we maintain a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our need to adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

distributors 

 

we use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to nondirect customers such as small computer and ce manufacturers dealers systems integrators online retailers and other resellers distributors accounted for approximately 36 39 and 36 of our revenue for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories we grant our distributors limited price protection rights 

 

retailers 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs online retailers and computer electronics stores and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers retailers accounted for approximately 16 7 and 6 of our revenue for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe the retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for wd and our products retailers supply endusers with products to upgrade their computers and externally store their data for backup or mobility purposes we grant our retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis we also sell our branded products at our web site 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific japan europe and the middle east our international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 68 68 and 65 of our revenue for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations for further discussion regarding the risks related to sales to international customers see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and significant customer information see part ii item 8 notes 1 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

we perform our marketing and advertising functions internally and through outside firms we target advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and enduser categories we utilize both consumer media and trade publications we have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures we also maintain customer relationships by communicating with our resellers and providing endusers with information and support through our web site 

competition 

 

we compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use in desktop notebook enterprise ce and external storage products our competitors in the hard drive market include excelstor technology fujitsu limited hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics incorporated seagate technology and toshiba corporation in 2006 seagate completed the acquisition of maxtor corporation which at the time of the acquisition was one of the hard drive industry’s four largest suppliers 

 

the hard drive industry is intensely competitive with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies by customer and market we believe that we are generally competitive in all of these factors 

 

we believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products therefore we believe that we cannot differentiate wd hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly we differentiate wd by focusing on operational excellence high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating into our hard drives desirable product performance attributes such performance attributes include seek times data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics error recovery low operating temperature low power consumption and optimized streaming capabilities in addition we emphasize nonproduct related attributes including rapid response to our customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction we also rely on the strength of the wd brand name with valueadded resellers retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive products directly and indirectly we believe that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation its execution track record and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard drive particularly in a rapidly changing technology environment 

 

advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products with better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products highspeed semiconductor memory could compete with our hard drive products in the future semiconductor memory is much faster in some applications than magnetic hard drives but currently is not competitive from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance attributes than hard drives it has lower “write” performance attributes flash memory could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives we believe that the traditional highvolume computing markets will remain the domain of 35inch and 25inch hard drives based on the hdd industry’s attributes of reliability availability and cost 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to competition see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

service and warranty 

 

we generally warrant our newly manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from the date of manufacture depending on the type of product our warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive we have engaged third parties in australia brazil canada china germany hungary india korea russia singapore thailand and the united arab emirates to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned hard drives for our customers in addition we process test and recertify returned hard drives at our facility in the united states 

 

manufacturing 

 

we believe that we have significant knowhow unique product manufacturing processes execution skills and human resources to continue to be successful and have the ability to grow as necessary our manufacturing operations to be competitive we must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs we strive to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields reliable products 

and highquality components that we manufacture ourselves while insisting that our suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of our hard drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key supplier relationships by establishing close relationships with our strategic component suppliers we believe we access bestofclass manufacturing quality in addition we believe that our sourcing strategy currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

 

hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs of this manufacturing environment our clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

 

we manufacture hard drives in malaysia and thailand we continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs we continually evaluate which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

 

in july 2003 we purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite corporation formerly one of our suppliers of heads including its wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and its slider fabrication facility in bang pain thailand we upgraded and enhanced these facilities to meet the demands of new technologies consistent with our hard drive production facilities we use these facilities to design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads hgas we include in the hard drives we manufacture 

 

we are currently expanding our head wafer manufacturing facilities in fremont california and expect to complete the expansion in calendar 2009 which will provide us with adequate wafer fabrication capacity for the foreseeable future 

 

following our planned acquisition of komag we will also have media and substrate design and manufacturing facilities in malaysia we plan to use these facilities to design and manufacture most of the media and substrates that we use in our products 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

materials and supplies 

 

the following products are the major components currently used in the manufacture of our hard drives 

 

  

we also use several other components in our hard drives such as seals filters plastic molded parts capacitors resistors connectors and cables 

 

we design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads required for the hard drives we manufacture we purchase a portion of these components from third party suppliers following our planned acquisition of komag we intend to follow a similar operational strategy of internally supplying the majority of our media and substrate requirements and purchasing the remainder from independent media suppliers 

 

we acquire all of the remaining components for our products from third party suppliers we generally retain multiple suppliers for each of our component requirements but in some instances use sole sources for business reasons 

we solesource some components such as custom integrated circuit devices for certain products from suppliers like marvell technology stmicroelectronics and texas instruments because of their custom nature these products require significant designin periods and long lead times there has been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased integration of various separate circuits we expect this trend to continue in custom integrated circuits for hard drives 

 

for an additional discussion of risks related to our component supplies see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

backlog 

 

historically a substantial portion of our orders have been for shipments of hard drives within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order we generally negotiate pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions before receiving a computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition we make many of our sales to oems under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead we receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods 

 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

 

we own numerous patents and have many patent applications in process we believe that although our patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff accordingly the patents held and applied for do not ensure our future success 

 

in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we believe that our nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of our process technology is an important factor in our success we rely upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states 

 

we rely on certain technology that we license from other parties to manufacture and sell wd products we believe that we have adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard drive industry for additional discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of intellectual property see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

environmental regulation 

 

we are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with our operations we believe that we have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our operations for additional discussion of risks related to environmental regulation see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

employees 

 

as of june 29 2007 we employed a total of 29572 employees worldwide this represents an increase in headcount of approximately 20 since july 2 2006 and an increase of approximately 28 since july 1 2005 many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly we offer employee benefit programs which we believe are in the aggregate competitive with those offered by our competitors we and most of our competitors nevertheless have difficulty at times in hiring and retaining certain skilled employees we have engaged consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited we consider our employee relations to be good

declines in average selling prices “asps” in the hard drive industry adversely affect our operating results 

 

the hard drive industry historically has experienced declining asps our asps tend to decline when competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share our asps also decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products if asps in the hard drive industry continue to decline then our asps will also likely decline which would adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets for hard drives our operating results could be adversely affected 

 

over the past few years the consumer market for computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems if we are not able to continue to offer a competitively priced hard drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results 

 

the market for hard drives is also fragmenting into a variety of devices and products many industry analysts expect as do we that as content increasingly converts to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue to converge and hard drives will be found in many ce products other than computers in addition we expect that the consumer market for multimedia applications including audiovideo products incorporating high capacity and handheld consumer storage will continue to grow however because this market remains relatively new accurate forecasts for future growth remain challenging 

 

moreover some devices such as personal video recorders and digital video recorders or some new pc operating systems which allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality therefore allowing for greater market differentiation may require attributes not currently offered in our products resulting in a need to expend capital to develop new interfaces form factors technical specifications or hard drive features increasing our overall operational expense without corresponding incremental revenue at this stage if we are not successful in continuing to deploy our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for the emerging ce market or if we are required to incur significant costs in developing such products it may harm our operating results 

 

our prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable enduser demand and oversupply of hard drives 

 

demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price competition if intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenue and gross margins 

 

our failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

the hard drive industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts if our forecasts exceed actual market demand or if market demand decreases significantly from our forecasts then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if our forecasts do not meet actual market demand of if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

 

we also use forecasts in making decisions regarding investment of our resources for example as the hard drive industry transitions from the parallel advanced technology attachment “pata” interface to the sata interface we may invest more resources in the development of products using the sata interface if our forecasts regarding the replacement of the pata interface with the sata interface are inaccurate we may not have products available to meet our customers’ needs 

in addition although we receive forecasts from our customers they are not obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts in particular sales volumes in the distribution channel are volatile and harder to predict than sales to our oem or odm customers we consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and our inventory requirements if we fail to accurately forecast our customers’ product demands we may have inadequate or excess inventory of our products or components which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

increases in areal density may outpace customers’ demand for storage capacity which may lower the prices our customers are willing to pay for new products 

 

historically the industry has experienced periods of variable areal density growth rates when the rate of areal density growth increases the rate of increase may exceed the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity furthermore our customers’ demand for storage capacity may not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result of developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital rights management or otherwise these factors could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with lower capacity hard drives at lower prices thereby decreasing our revenue as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity our asps could decline which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

a low cost structure is critical to our operating results and increased costs may adversely affect our operating margin 

 

a low cost structure for our products including critical components labor and overhead is critical to the success of our business and our operating results depend on our ability to maintain competitive cost structures on new and established products if our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost structure for manufacturing hard drives and we are unable to match their cost structure we could be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors 

 

shortages of commodity materials or use by other industries of materials used in the hard drive industry may increase our cost structure 

 

there are costs for certain commodity materials an increase in which increases our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard drives and key components for example shortages of materials such as steel aluminum and precious metals increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to find ways to mitigate these increased costs the variability in the cost of oil also affects our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass increased costs through to our customers 

 

additionally there are certain limited supply materials such as raw materials like nickel and steel as well as metals like neodymium and ruthenium which are used in the manufacturing of hard drive components if other high volume industry demands for any of these materials increase our costs may increase which could have an adverse affect on our operating margins 

 

changes in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial results 

 

product life cycles lengthened over the four years beginning in calendar year 2002 due in large part to a decrease in the rate of hard drive areal density growth however with the use of perpendicular recording in hard drives beginning in calendar year 2006 we anticipate that the life cycle of these products may shorten if product life cycles lengthen we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that product this may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results if product life cycles shorten it may be more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to increase areal density we may fail to remain competitive 

 

new products in the hard drive market typically require higher areal densities than previous product generations posing formidable technical and manufacturing challenges higher areal densities require existing head and media technology to be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on a single disk in addition our introduction of new products during a technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns our 

failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results 

 

a fundamental change in recording technology could result in significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

the industry is developing and now implementing new recording technologies that enable greater recording densities than currently available using magnetoresistive head technology including perpendicular and tunneling junction technology each of which represent a significant change in fundamental recording technology this shift in technology is difficult to implement and historically when the industry experiences a fundamental change in technology any manufacturer that fails to successfully and timely adjust their designs and processes to accommodate the new technology fails to remain competitive 

 

there are some technologies such as current perpendiculartoplane and heat assisted magnetic recording that if they can be implemented by a competitor on a commercially viable basis will represent a revolutionary recording technology that could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

as a result of these technology shifts we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies such as heads media and tools to remain competitive if we fail to successfully implement these new technologies or if we are significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new technologies we may not be able to offer products with capacities that our customers desire for example new recording technology requires changes in the manufacturing process of media which may cause longer production times and reduce the overall availability of media in the industry additionally the new technology requires a greater degree of integration between heads and media which may lengthen our time of development of hard drives using this technology furthermore as we attempt to develop and implement new technologies we may become more dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components that accommodate the new technology these results would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

the difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost reduction 

 

storage capacity of the hard drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however because increasing areal density has become more difficult in the hard drive industry such increases may require increases in component costs and other opportunities to reduce costs may not continue at historical rates additionally increases in areal density may require us to make further capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment needed as a result of an increased number of gb per platter our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to maintain effective relationships with our major component suppliers our supply of critical components may be at risk and our profitability could suffer 

 

under our business model we do not manufacture many of the component parts used in our hard drives however for some of our product families we do make most of our own heads and we intend to make most of our own media following our planned acquisition of komag as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our major component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers each of which employs variations on technology which can impact for example feasible combinations of heads and media components in august 2003 we settled litigation with a supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard drives as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our profitability was at risk until another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and manufacturing equipment could lead to delays lost revenue or increased costs 

 

certain components are available from a limited number of suppliers because we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain hard drive components and manufacturing equipment each of the following could significantly harm our operating results 

 

  

our future operating results may also depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines in addition some of the components or component types used in our products are used in other devices such as mobile telephones and digital cameras if there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component or component type from several high volume industries resulting in a supply reduction or a component is otherwise in short supply or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component for example in the last year the hard drive industry faced a tightness in the availability of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic components such as heads media and magnets if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of materials used in the manufacture of magnetic components or other necessary components we may experience production delays which could cause us loss of revenue if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

in addition certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or testing processes is available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment uses materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

contractual commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying increased charges and cash advances for such components 

 

to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying components as a result we may be subject to cancellation charges if we cancel orders which may occur when we make technology transitions or when our component needs change in addition we have entered into contractual commitments with component suppliers such as suppliers of media and may enter into contractual commitments with other component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices some of these commitments require or may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier however these commitments may not result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply of such components 

 

our highvolume hard drive manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers are concentrated in asia and our planned media manufacturing facilities will be located in asia which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of any of these facilities and localized risks to employees in these locations 

 

our highvolume hard drive manufacturing facilities are in malaysia and thailand and the manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers are in asia following our planned acquisition of komag we will also have media and substrate manufacturing facilities in malaysia a condition or event such as political instability civil unrest or a power outage or a fire flood earthquake or other disaster that adversely affects any of these facilities or our ability to manufacture could 

limit the total volume of hard drives we are able to manufacture and result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results similarly a localized health risk affecting our employees or the staff of our suppliers such as a new pandemic influenza in asia could impair the total volume of hard drives that we are able to manufacture 

 

our head manufacturing operations include a single wafer fabrication facility in fremont california and a single head gimbal assembly facility in bang pain thailand and our planned media operations will include four facilities in malaysia which subjects us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations at either of these facilities are disrupted 

 

as we have previously discussed in public statements our business plan presently contemplates that we plan to design and manufacture approximately 70 to 80 of the heads required for the hard drives we manufacture we fabricate wafers in our fremont california facility and the wafers are then sent to our thailand facility for slider fabrication and wafer slicing and hga assembly and testing additionally following our planned acquisition of komag we will manufacture the majority of our media and substrates in malaysia facilities a fire flood earthquake or other disaster condition or event such as a power outage that adversely affects our facilities in fremont california or bang pain thailand or in malaysia following our planned acquisition of komag would significantly affect supply of our heads or media respectively and limit our ability to manufacture hard drives which would result in a substantial loss of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating results 

 

following our planned acquisition of komag if we fail to successfully integrate komag’s business into our operations in the expected time frame or at all it may adversely affect our future results 

 

we believe that our planned acquisition of komag will result in certain benefits including certain cost operational and other efficiencies and synergies the success of our planned acquisition will be dependent on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from vertically integrating komag’s business into our operations and komag’s media technology with our head technology following the planned acquisition we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits on a timely basis or at all for a variety of reasons including the following 

 

  

if we are not able to successfully integrate komag’s business and technology into our operations the anticipated benefits and efficiencies of the planned acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and our ability to compete our profit margins and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

the successful completion of our planned acquisition of komag is subject to risks and uncertainties and in the event we fail to complete the acquisition our stock price could suffer and our relationship with vendors and customers may be adversely impacted 

 

our ability to complete the planned acquisition of komag is subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risk that a condition to closing of the transaction may not be satisfied and the risk that we fail to obtain the financing necessary to complete the transaction there is also no assurance that an adequate number of komag shares will be validly tendered and not withdrawn in the tender offer sufficient to satisfy our minimum tender offer condition in the event that the tender offer or merger is not completed or is delayed the current market price of our common stock may decline if based on an assumption that the merger will occur as contemplated during the third calendar quarter of 2007 additionally these uncertainties regarding the merger may adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and customers 

there are certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy to vertically integrate our operations 

 

our vertical integration of head manufacturing resulted in a fundamental change in our operating structure as we now manufacture heads for use in many of the hard drives we manufacture similarly our planned integration of komag’s media business into our overall operations will allow us to manufacture media components to work with our heads consequently we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than assumed in our prior financial business model if the overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head or planned media manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our results of operations we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components that we do not manufacture ourselves 

 

in addition we may incur additional risks including 

 

  

if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head or planned media manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

 

our operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to optimize the overall quality timetomarket and timetovolume of new and established products 

 

to achieve consistent success with our customers we must balance several key attributes such as timetomarket timetovolume quality cost service price and a broad product portfolio if we fail to 

 

  

our operating results will be adversely affected 

 

if we are unable to timely and costeffectively develop heads and media following our planned acquisition of komag with leading technology and overall quality our ability to sell our products may be significantly diminished which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

under our business plan we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads used in some of the hard drives products we manufacture and following our planned acquisition of komag we intend to develop and manufacture a substantial portion of the media used in some of the hard drive products we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head technologies and will be less able to take advantage of media technologies developed by other manufacturers technology transition for head and media designs is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and media there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads or media for products using future technologies we also may not effectively transition our head or planned media design and technology to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads we manufacture or media we plan to manufacture in addition we may not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs for example we recently began using perpendicular recording heads in certain of our products we face various challenges in ramping the manufacturing volume of these products and if we do not adequately address these challenges or if we encounter quality problems with the heads we manufacture or media we plan to manufacture for these products our continued shipment of these products may be delayed impairing our ability to realize revenue from these products 

 

failure by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture components for our products may adversely affect our operations 

 

we rely on suppliers for various component parts that we integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves such as semiconductors motors flex circuits and suspensions we are dependent on the suppliers of these various components to be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources to develop technology that can be successfully integrated with our products and to manufacture these components efficiently the failure of component suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and manufacture technology that can be integrated into our products may cause us to experience inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment of hard drive products or our expansion into new technology and markets therefore adversely affecting our business and financial results 

 

if we fail to qualify our products with our customers they may not purchase any units of a particular product line which would have a significant adverse impact on our sales 

 

we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume oems which continue to consolidate their share of the pc and ce markets if product life cycles lengthen we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could harm our competitive position these risks are increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current generation products 

 

we are subject to risks related to product defects which could result in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability limitations 

 

we warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to five years we test our hard drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product in addition a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers including our oem and odm customers 

 

our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than us we 

record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

current or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match 

 

it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes 

 

higher capacity storage needs have typically been better served by magnetic hard drives than flash memory as hard drive manufacturers can offer better value at high capacities while lower capacity needs have been successfully served by solid state storage such as flash memory technology advances in magnetic optical semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products if we fail to be cost competitive against flash memory we could be at a competitive disadvantage to companies using semiconductor technology 

 

further industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 

 

the hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity abilities and resources and lower their cost structure causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage additionally continued industry consolidation may lead to uncertainty in areas such as component availability which could negatively impact our cost structure 

 

sales in the distribution channel are important to our business and if we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if distribution markets for hard drives weaken our operating results could suffer 

 

our distribution customers typically sell to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers we face significant competition in this channel as a result of limited product qualification programs and a significant focus on price and availability of product if we fail to remain competitive in terms of our technology quality service and support our distribution customers may favor our competitors and our operating results could suffer we also face significant risk in the distribution market for hard drives if the distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing pc growth rate technology transitions or a significant change in consumer buying preference from white box to branded pcs or we experience significant price declines due to oversupply in the distribution channel then our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

the hard drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by significant shifts in market share among the major competitors 

 

the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence we also face competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory these factors taken together may result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants in addition product recalls can lead to a loss of market share which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

some of our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard drive industry periodically sell disk drives at prices that we cannot profitably match 

 

some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to achieve profitability they periodically sell hard drives at lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a loss while still remaining profitable overall in 

addition if these competitors can increase sales of nonhard drive products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their hard drives at low prices our results of operations may be adversely affected if we can not successfully compete with the pricing by these companies 

 

if we do not successfully expand into new hard drive markets and manage the issues associated with new products and new markets our business may suffer 

 

to remain a significant supplier of hard drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch hard drives for the desktop enterprise ce and external storage markets and we also offer 25inch form factor hard drives for the mobile ce and external storage markets however demand for hard drives may shift to products in smaller form factors which our competitors may already offer expansion into other hard drive markets and resulting increases in volume capacity requirements may require us to make substantial additional capital investments due in part because our operations are vertically integrated 

 

while we continue to develop new products and look to expand into other hard drive markets the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated with these new products and new markets such as difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp market acceptance effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand quality problems or other defects in the early stages of new product introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products and higher return rates of external storage products due to more lenient return policies in the retail market further we need to identify how any of the hard drive markets that we are expanding into may have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently exist such as demand volume growth rates demand seasonality product generations development rates customer concentrations and cost and performance requirements and we must properly address these differences if we fail to successfully develop and manufacture new products and expand into new hard drive markets customers may decrease the amount of our products that they purchase and we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products 

 

if we do not properly manage the technology transitions of our products our operating results may be negatively affected 

 

many of the markets in which we offer our products are undergoing technology transitions for example in order to handle higher data transfer rates the pc and enterprise markets are transitioning from parallel interfaces such as pata and scsi to serial interfaces such as sata and sas respectively we must effectively manage the transition of the features of our products to serial interfaces in order to remain competitive and cost effective in the pc market we currently offer pata and sata products and must timely and efficiently manage both our manufacture of pata products through their end of life and our ramp of sata products and features if we fail to successfully manage the transition from parallel interfaces to serial interfaces our operating results may suffer 

 

expanding into new hard drive markets exposes our business to different seasonal demand cycles which in turn could adversely affect our operating results 

 

the ce and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and volume demand cycles as compared to the pc market by expanding into these markets we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations that are different from and in addition to those of the pc market for example because the primary customer for products such as our branded products are individual consumers these markets experience a dramatic increase in demand during the winter holiday season if we do not properly adjust our supply to new demand cycles such as this we risk having excess inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient inventory during periods of high demand therefore adversely affecting our operating results 

 

if we do not successfully continue to expand into the mobile market or if we do not accurately predict the growth and demands of the mobile market our business may suffer 

 

we began shipping 25inch form factor hard drives for the mobile market during calendar year 2004 if we are unable to successfully continue to expand into the mobile market we would have a competitive disadvantage to companies that are successful in this regard and our business and financial results could suffer to increase the sale of our products in the mobile market we must adapt to the differences between the desktop and mobile markets such as different requirements features and competitors in addition if we continue to incur significant costs in manufacturing 

and selling the 25inch hard drives and if we are unable to recover those costs from sales of the products then we may not be able to compete successfully in this market and our operating results may suffer 

 

furthermore if we do not accurately predict the future growth and demands of the mobile market our business may suffer for example if the volume demand of the pc market shifts from desktop computers to notebook computers at a faster rate than we anticipate we would be at a more significant competitive disadvantage to companies who have been more successful in the mobile market 

 

selling to the retail market has become an important part of our business and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share or gain market acceptance of our branded products our operating results could suffer 

 

we sell our branded products directly to a select group of major retailers for example computer superstores and ce stores and authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and online resellers our current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe we are facing increased competition from other companies for shelf space at a small number of major retailers that have strong buying power and pricing leverage if we fail to successfully maintain a customer preference for western digital brand products or fail to successfully expand into multiple channels our operating results may be adversely affected we face strong competition in maintaining and trying to grow our market share in the retail market particularly because of the relatively low barriers to entry in this market we will continue to introduce new products in the retail market that incorporate our disk drives however there can be no assurance that these products will gain market acceptance and if they do not our operating results could suffer 

 

loss of market share with or by a key customer could harm our operating results 

 

during 2007 a large percentage of our revenue came from sales to our top 10 customers which accounted for 47 of our revenue one of these customers dell accounted for more than 10 of our revenue these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and may be able to cancel an order or terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs if a customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key customer suffers financial hardship then our operating results would likely be harmed in addition if customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue 

 

we may be unable to retain our key staff and skilled employees 

 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key staff and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who have received equity compensation if we are unable to retain our existing key staff or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key staff or skilled employees or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

manufacturing and marketing our products abroad subjects us to numerous risks 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations and foreign marketing efforts including 

 

 25 

 

  

while neither the 2006 thai coup d’état nor terrorist bombings in bangkok had any appreciable impact on our manufacturing operations these events illustrate the risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations and foreign marketing efforts and the importance to our business of stability in the countries in which we operate 

 

terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate additionally it is uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will have on shipping costs acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

sudden disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an impact on our operations 

 

we ship the majority of our products to our various customers via air freight the sudden unavailability of air cargo operations used to ship our products would impair our ability to deliver our products in a timely and efficient manner which could adversely impact our operating results we also ship our product via ocean freight and events or conditions at shipping ports such as labor difficulties or disputes could also impact our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver these products 

 

we face litigation risks relating to our historical stock option grants that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

 

several purported derivative actions were filed nominally on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical stock option granting practices see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for a more detailed description of these proceedings we are and may in the future be subject to other litigation or government investigations arising in connection with such option practices these proceedings may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and the outcome of any such proceeding is difficult to predict the defense of such lawsuits or investigations could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives some or all of the amount we may be required to pay to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these proceedings may not be covered by insurance 

 

under indemnification agreements we have entered into with our current and former officers and directors we are required to indemnify them and advance expenses to them in connection with their participation in proceedings arising out of their service to us these payments may be material 

 

the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 

 

the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may 

result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to time if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 

 

our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology despite safeguards to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

 

environmental regulation costs could harm our operating results 

 

we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries for example the european union has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment “rohs” and the waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directives rohs prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including hard drives put on the market after july 1 2006 the weee directive obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to takeback and properly dispose of the equipment there is still some uncertainty in certain eu countries as to which party involved in the manufacture distribution and sale of electronic equipment will be ultimately responsible for registration reporting and disposal similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products such as asia we will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our component suppliers also timely comply with such laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with the legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations we could incur substantial costs and be subject to disruptions to our operations and logistics in addition if we were found to be in violation of these laws we could be subject to governmental fines and liability to our customers if we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws or if we are subject to significant expenses in connection with a violation of these laws our financial condition or operating results could suffer 

 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations may negatively affect our operating results 

 

because we manufacture our products abroad our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the thai baht and of the malaysian ringgit may negatively impact our operating results 

the thai baht is a free floating currency while the malaysian ringgit exchange rate policy is one of a managed float we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place currently we hedge the thai baht malaysian ringgit euro and british pound sterling with forward contracts 

 

if the us dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most foreign currencies the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated 

 

increases in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses and an increase in our operating costs 

 

some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies such as odms that provide manufacturing services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk additionally as we attempt to expand our oem and distribution channel sales into emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china the customers in these regions may have relatively short operating histories making it more difficult for us to accurately access the associated credit risks any credit losses we may suffer as a result of these increased risks or as a result of credit losses from any significant customer would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly results 

 

we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

  

rapidly changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to predict actual results 

 

we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions these changes have impacted our financial results in the past and may continue to do so in the future key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

 28 

 

  

the market price of our common stock is volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

 

securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

we may be unable to raise future capital through debt or equity financing 

 

due to the risks described herein in the future we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital expenditures expansion or acquisition activity working capital and research and development if we decide to increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development efforts or if results of operations do not meet our expectations we could require additional debt or equity financing however we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available to us or available on acceptable terms an equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

 

if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected 

 

our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of june 29 2007 in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods however if our internal controls are found to be ineffective our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected

our company 

 

we design develop manufacture and sell hard drives a hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks to store and allow fast access to data hard drives are key components of computers including desktop and notebook computers “pcs” data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic “ce” devices 

 

we sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and original design manufactures “odms” for use in computer systems subsystems or ce devices and to distributors resellers and retailers our hard drives are used in desktop computers notebook computers and enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage storage area networks and video surveillance equipment additionally our hard drives are used in ce applications such as digital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” we also sell our hard drives as standalone storage products and integrate them into our own wdbranded external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music photography video and other data 

hard drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device our hard drives currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes “gb” to 1 terabyte “tb” nominal rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including both enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” and serial advanced technology attachment “sata” we also embed our hard drives into wdbranded external storage appliances that utilize interfaces such as usb 20 external sata firewire tm and ethernet network connections in addition we recently announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than previous designs 

 

we manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies “hsas” in malaysia and thailand we also design and manufacture a substantial portion of our required magnetic heads in california and head gimbal assemblies “hgas” in thailand following our planned acquisition of komag incorporated “komag” a leading media manufacturer and one of our current suppliers we will also design in california and manufacture in malaysia most of our required media and substrates for geographical financial data see part ii item 8 note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

on june 28 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of komag for a value of approximately 10 billion the planned acquisition of komag is intended to strengthen our production effeciencies and enhance our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating media the planned acquisition is structured as a cash tender offer at 3225 per share for all the outstanding shares of komag common stock followed by a merger of our indirect whollyowned subsidiary into komag in which the remaining shareholders of komag will receive 3225 in cash per share the planned acquisition is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2007 we intend to fund the planned acquisition including the expected repurchase of komag’s convertible notes due 2014 and related fees and expenses through a combination of cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term bridge loan facility of up to 13 billion

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated summary information regarding volume shipments average selling prices “asps” and revenues by geography channel and product in millions except percentages and asps 

 

 

 

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

 

net revenue net revenue was 55 billion for 2007 an increase of 26 from 2006 total unit shipments increased to 97 million as compared to 73 million for the prior year this unit increase resulted from an increase in our desktop market share stronger overall demand for hard drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the nondesktop market including mobile ce enterprise and branded products for example we shipped 12 million drives to the mobile market in 2007 as compared to 5 million units in 2006 additionally we shipped 10 million units to the dvr market in 2007 as compared to 7 million units in 2006 asps declined to 57 due to normal technology price declines and a more competitive pricing environment in the notebook desktop and consumer electronics markets changes in revenue by geography generally reflect overall market demand fluctuations for hard drives changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of branded products due to the growing worldwide acceptance of our wd my book tm and wd passport ® external digital storage appliances 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2007 was 900 million an increase of 71 million or 9 over the prior year gross margin percentage decreased to 165 in 2007 from 191 in 2006 the factors contributing to this decrease include normal technology price declines and a more competitive pricing environment in the notebook desktop and consumer electronics markets in addition gross margin in 2006 benefited from a more favorable supplydemand balance 

 

operating expenses total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses decreased to 89 of net revenue in 2007 compared to 107 in 2006 rd expense was 306 million in 2007 an increase of 9 million or 3 over the prior year the increase in rd expense was primarily related to the development of new product platforms in support of our entry into new markets and expenditures for advanced head technologies partially offset by a decrease of 2 million in variable incentive compensation programs sga expense was 179 million in 2007 an increase of 13 million or 8 as compared to 2006 the increase in sga expense was primarily due to an increase of 19 million in stock based compensation expense and other longterm employee incentive programs offset by a 5 million decrease in software writeoffs that occurred in 2006 

 

interest and other income net interest and other income was 28 million and 16 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively this increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash and shortterm investment balances 

 

income tax benefit income tax benefit was 121 million and 13 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes was 27 and 3 for 2007 and 2006 respectively differences between the effective tax rates and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive programs and reductions to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we have tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2022 in addition to the tax holidays the tax provision was impacted by favorable adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 126 and 22 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively these adjustments were based upon determination that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized in the fourth quarter of 2007 we reversed the remaining valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence including our history of cumulative pretax income and the increased likelihood of our ability to generate profits in the future in 2006 we released a portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets due to the difficulty at the time in accurately projecting income for periods of longer than two years given the cyclical nature of our industry the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in future years the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or company conditions 

 

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

 

net revenue net revenue was 43 billion for 2006 an increase of 19 from 2005 total unit shipments increased to 73 million as compared to 61 million for the prior year this unit increase resulted from an increase in our desktop market share stronger overall demand for hard drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the nondesktop market including mobile ce and branded products for example we shipped 5 million drives to the mobile market in 2006 as compared to 1 million units in 2005 additionally we shipped 7 million units to the dvr market in 2006 as compared to 4 million units in 2005 asps remained at a relatively constant level of 59 due to an increase in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold offset by moderate price declines revenue contribution by geographic region for 2006 as compared to 2005 reflects our focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic markets primarily in asia changes in revenue by channel reflect overall market demand fluctuations for hard drives 

 

gross margin gross margin for 2006 was 829 million an increase of 239 million or 41 over the prior year gross margin percentage increased to 191 in 2006 from 162 in 2005 gross margin in 2006 benefited from a more favorable supplydemand balance in addition gross margin was favorably impacted in 2006 by the following factors 1 manufacturing efficiencies 2 lower customer returns resulting from ongoing quality improvements that favorably impacted warranty obligations and 3 an increase in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold moderate price declines somewhat offset the favorable impact of the aforementioned factors during 2006 and 2005 our warranty accrual for prior quarters’ shipments was favorably adjusted by approximately 30 million and 1 million respectively as a result of improvements in quality and customer return rates and their expected impact on future levels of customer returns under warranty 

 

operating expenses total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses were 107 of net revenue in 2006 as compared to 109 in 2005 rd expense was 297 million in 2006 an increase of 57 million or 24 over the prior year the increase in rd expense was primarily related to the development of new product platforms in support of our entry into new markets expenditures for advanced head technologies and an increase of 18 million in employee incentive compensation programs of which 12 million related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123r sga expense was 166 million in 2006 an increase of 11 million or 7 as compared to 2005 this increase in sga expense was primarily due to an expansion of sales resources to support increasing desktop computer demand in certain geographic regions the growing mobile and ce markets an increase of 15 million in employee incentive compensation programs of which 7 million related to the adoption of sfas no 123r and a 5 million software writeoff the 2005 fiscal period included a 19 million charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit 

 

interest and other income net interest and other income was 16 million and 5 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively this increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash and shortterm investment balances as well as increases in the rates of return on investments 

 

income tax expense benefit income tax benefit expense was 13 million and 4 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively tax benefit expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 3 and 2 for 2006 and 2005 respectively differences between the effective tax rates and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2022 in addition to the tax holidays the tax provision for 2006 was favorably impacted by 22 million given the partial reduction of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets upon determination that it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realized the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 a twoyear period was used due to the difficulty at the time in accurately projecting income for longer periods of time given the cyclical nature of our industry the 2005 effective tax rate benefited by approximately 07 from the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we ended 2007 with total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 907 million an increase of 208 million from june 30 2006 our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds a portion of our available funds is invested in auction rate securities which are shortterm investments in bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days the following table summarizes the results of our statements of cash flows for the three years ended june 29 2007 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was 618 million as compared to 368 million during 2006 and 421 million for 2005 cash flow from operations consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents our principal source of cash net cash used to fund working capital was 78 million for 2007 as compared to 207 million for 2006 and net cash provided by changes in working capital of 89 million for 2005 

 

our working capital requirements depend upon the effective management of our cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly a company can convert its products into cash through sales the following table summarizes the cash conversion cycle for the three years ended 2007 

 

 

 

the increase in the cash conversion cycle for 2007 was primarily due to our days sales outstanding “dsos” which increased by six days from 2006 this increase was primarily due to the discontinuance of an early pay program with one of our larger customers and increasing sales to branded products’ customers and other customers who have longer payment terms 

from time to time we modify the timing of payments to our vendors we make these modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows including our cash balances generally we make the payment modifications through negotiations with or by granting to or receiving from our vendors’ payment term accommodations 

 

investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities for 2007 was 383 million as compared to 303 million for 2006 and 274 million for 2005 during 2007 cash used in investing activities consisted of 324 million for capital expenditures and 59 million for shortterm investments during 2006 cash used in investing activities consisted of 268 million for capital expenditures and 35 million for shortterm investments the increase in capital expenditures in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily consists of equipment purchased to support our investments in advanced head technologies new product platforms and capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio the increase in capital expenditures in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily a result of assets purchased to upgrade our head manufacturing capabilities increased desktop and mobile hard drive production capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets additionally during 2006 we purchased our previously leased head wafer manufacturing facility in fremont california for 27 million for 2008 we expect capital additions to be between 600 million and 650 million of which approximately 200 million will be utilized for the expansion of our head wafer fabrication capacity depreciation and amortization for 2008 is expected to be between 270 and 290 million 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities for 2007 was 86 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1 million for 2006 and net cash used in financing activities of 7 million for 2005 the net cash used in financing activities in 2007 consisted of 73 million used for repurchases of our common stock and 43 million used for repayments of longterm debt offset by 30 million received through the exercise of common stock options and our employee stock purchase plan the net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 consisted of 78 million received through the exercise of common stock options and our employee stock purchase plan offset by 54 million used in repurchases of our common stock and 23 million used for repayments of longterm debt the net cash used in financing activities in 2005 consisted of 45 million used for repurchases of our common stock and 20 million for debt repayments offset by 58 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans

capital commitments 

 

the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of june 29 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 38 

 

in anticipation of our planned acquisition of komag we intend to fund the transaction including the expected repurchase of komag’s convertible notes due 2014 and related fees and expenses through a combination of our cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term bridge loan facility of up to 13 billion 

 

longterm debt 

 

we maintained a 125 million credit facility “senior credit facility” with a termination date of september 20 2009 the facility provided for a revolving credit line subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation and a term loan the term loan was paid in full as of march 30 2007 a letter of termination was submitted for the senior credit facility on june 28 th  2007 and termination was finalized during the first quarter of 2008 

 

purchase orders 

 

in the normal course of business we issue purchase orders to suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process 

 

we have entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers the commitments are subject to minimum quality requirements in addition the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered and future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above 

 

from time to time we enter into other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above please see item 1a of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of risks related to these commitments 

 

forward exchange contracts 

 

we purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for our current forward exchange contract commitments 

 

indemnifications 

 

in the ordinary course of business we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers we maintain director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances 

 

it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase 250 million of our common stock in open market transactions the term of the program is a fiveyear period from november 17 2005 to november 17 2010 we expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows during 2007 we repurchased 40 million shares of 

common stock at a total cost of 73 million subsequent to the end of 2007 we purchased 08 million shares for approximately 16 million during 2006 we repurchased 35 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 54 million since the inception of the program and through august 16 2007 we have repurchased 151 million shares for a total cost of 204 million subject to any limitations that may be set forth in our proposed bridge loan facility to be entered into with our planned acquisition of komag we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow 

 

we believe our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the foreseeable future our ability to sustain our working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that we discuss in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

we have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets liabilities and shareholders’ equity we have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

 

revenue and accounts receivable 

 

in accordance with standard industry practice we have agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other incentive programs in accordance with current accounting standards we recognize revenue upon delivery to oems odms and resellers and record a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers we base these adjustments on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers as well as historical pricing information if endmarket demand for hard drives declines significantly we may have to increase sellthrough incentive payments to resellers resulting in an increase in our allowances which could adversely impact operating results 

 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if our overall loss history changes significantly an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could affect operating results 

 

we establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized we base these provisions on existing product return notifications if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return accrual would be required which could negatively affect operating results 

 

warranty 

 

we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues if any we use a statistical warranty tracking model to help with our estimates and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability such as factory test data historical field return rates and costs to repair by product type if actual product return trends costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates our future results of operations could be materially affected our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty any 

changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

inventory 

 

we value inventories at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value we record inventory writedowns for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

 

we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require an increase in inventory balance adjustments that could negatively affect operating results 

 

litigation and other contingencies 

 

we apply sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies accordingly we disclose contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when in consultation with our legal advisors we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable refer to part ii item 8 note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss “nol” and tax credit carryforwards we record a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 

 

we record estimated liabilities for tax uncertainties to the extent a tax position does not meet a probable level of certainty a liability is established based on the best estimate of the amount that will not be sustained however the actual liability in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially adjust previously recorded tax liabilities 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for all stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” under these provisions stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period under sfas no 123r we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we accounted for stockbased employee compensation plans including shares issued under our stock option plans and espp in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and its related interpretations “apb no 25” and followed the pro forma net income pro forma income per share and stockbased compensation plan disclosure requirements set forth in sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” all other types of equity awards were previously accounted for in accordance with sfas no 123 

the fair values of all stock options granted on and subsequent to january 1 2005 were estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all options granted on and prior to december 31 2004 and all espp shares were estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model both the binomial and the blackscholesmerton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the interpretation applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 109 fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin 48 and the amounts reported after adoption should be accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of fin 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities it also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances but provides clarification on acceptable fair valuation methods and applications sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas statement no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently assessing the impact sfas 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

as required by sec rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k kpmg llp our independent registered public accounting firm which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting see page 48 herein 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june 29 2007 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations of effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our chief executive officer and its chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving 

its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business tableend general 

  western digital corporation the “company” or “western digital” or “wd” designs develops manufactures and sells hard disk drives a hard disk drive is a device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks to allow fast access to data hard disk drives are one of the key components found in most computers and data storage subsystems 

  the company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop personal computers “pcs” notebook computers enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage and storage area networks and in consumer electronics “ce” products such as personaldigital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” in addition the company’s hard disk drives are used in external hard disk drive products that feature high speed buses such as 1394 firewireilink tm  universal serial bus “usb” and ethernet 

  hard disk drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data is not lost when power is no longer applied to the device the company’s hard disk drive products currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives the 35inch form factor drives have capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes “gb” to 400 gb nominal rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” and serial advanced technology attachment “sata” the 25inch form factor drives have capacities ranging from 40 gb to 80 gb nominal rotation speed of 5400 rpms and offer the eide interface in addition the company has plans to enter the 10inch hard disk drive market in the future the company anticipates that 10 inch hard disk drive products could be used in a variety of handheld consumer devices such as mp3 players cameras and cell phones 

  the company sells its products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” for inclusion in computer systems or subsystems and to distributors resellers and retailers the company’s hard disk drive products are currently manufactured in malaysia and thailand for geographical financial data see the company’s consolidated financial statements and note 9 thereto included in this annual report on form 10k 

industry 

  western digital’s primary business focus is the design development manufacture and sale of hard disk drives to the desktop pc mobile enterprise and consumer electronics markets 

  the company believes based on industry data that historically the sale of personal computers and hard disk drives were similar in volume however during the last five years the company believes the growth in hard disk drive sales has outpaced growth in personal computer sales for example based on industry data the company believes in calendar 2001 there were approximately 34 more hard disk drives sold in the market than personal computers in contrast in calendar 2004 there were approximately 61 more hard disk drives sold in the market than personal computers the company believes that this accelerating growth of hard disk drive sales is driven primarily by the following 

   desktop pc market 

  desktop pcs are used in a number of environments ranging from homes to businesses and multiuser networks software applications are used on desktop pcs for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and other related applications hard disk drives store both software applications 

3   and the data used by these software applications the company believes that the demand for hard disk drives in the pc market has grown in part due to 

   in addition the company believes the rate of pc unit growth is affected by several factors including maturing pc markets in north america and western europe an increase in firsttime buyers of pcs in eastern europe and asia and the lengthening of pc replacement cycles for an additional discussion of changes in the pc market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

  mobile computing market 

  the company expects the mobile computing market which is primarily notebook computers to grow faster than the desktop pc or enterprise markets in the next three years the company entered this market in october 2004 with the introduction of its wd scorpio tm product a 25inch form factor hard disk drive 

  the company believes that the demand for mobile drives has grown from approximately 16 of the overall hard disk drive market in 2002 to 24 of the overall hard disk drive market in 2004 the company believes that this growth trend will continue as people continue to buy notebook computers in increasing numbers 

  enterprise market 

  the enterprise market for hard disk drives focuses on customers that make workstations servers network attached storage storage area networks and other computing systems or subsystems this market has been traditionally served by hard disk drives that use the smallcomputersystemsinterface “scsi” standard recently however scsi hard disk drives are being supplemented by sata hard disk drives in certain enterprise storage applications sata is an interface technology supported by industry standards in most applications sata hard disk drives cost less than scsi while maintaining reliability scalability and performance necessary for many mainstream enterprise applications 

  the company believes that the use of sata hard disk drives in the enterprise hard disk drive market will continue to increase for example during the past few years a new diskbased backup application has emerged with highcapacity sata hard disk drives augmenting scsi tape and optical media this new trend popularly referred to as “nearline” storage has created a growth market due to the ability of hard disk drives to backup or access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions and to quickly retrieve critical backup or nearline data the increasing use of hard disk drives in nearline storage applications is also being enhanced by the availability of sata hard disk drive solutions which are more cost competitive as compared to scsi hard disk drives 

  in addition sata drives are also being used in unique clustering applications for databases scientific computing web caching and electronic mail these applications have become an important market for large capacity sata hard disk drives and the company believes that this market will continue to consume a growing portion of the company’s highest capacity hard disk drives in the next three years 

  consumer electronics market 

  the use of hard disk drives in consumer electronic products has been a new growth area in recent years currently the three largest uses for hard disk drives in this area are as follows 

   since 1999 hard disk drivebased recorders of audio and video content have been available for use in home entertainment systems commonly called personal video recorders “pvrs” or digital video recorders “dvrs” these 

4   consumer devices offer the enduser enhanced features such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program in addition hard disk drives are being increasingly incorporated into dvd recorders to allow for pvr dvr functionality and faster recording of content onto removable dvds in general the market for these products favor large capacity hard disk drives and there is a growing market for these products in japan and north america and strong interest in europe and the rest of asia pacific the company believes that growth in this market may increase the demand for higher capacity hard disk drives 

  the company has plans to enter the 10inch hard disk drive market in the future and anticipates offering 10inch hard disk drives for use in ce products to store and play audio content in addition the company believes that there may be opportunities for growth in sales of 10inch hard disk drives for use in future versions of cameras and cell phones the strong growth in demand for hard disk drive storage in ce products to store and play audio content increased significantly in the third calendar quarter of 2004 the company believes based on industry data that a total over 2 million hard disk drive based mp3 players were sold in the market for the third calendar quarter of 2004 the majority of hard disk drives used in mp3 players are either 10inch or 18inch products sales of hard disk drive based mp3 players featuring 10inch or 18inch products continued with strong growth into calendar 2005 

  for further discussion of the audiovideo market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

  hard disk drives continue to be used in game consoles although game console sales have fallen over the last four years although the company has provided hard disk drives for game consoles in the past the overall market growth for hard disk drives in game consoles continues to be challenged 

  for an additional discussion of the video game market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

  the external hard disk drive market 

  most new desktop pc systems are equipped with highspeed external interfaces such as 1394 firewireilink usb or ethernet as a result end users are able to supplement the storage space of their pc systems with the use of external hard disk drive products that connect via these highspeed interfaces external hard disk drive products are commonly used for storing additional programs or multimedia content or for backing up internal hard disk drives while the external hard disk drive market continues to be a small part of the overall hard disk drive market the company believes that sales of external hard disk drives will continue to grow in general external storage may often be the easiest quickest or only way of adding additional storage capacity to either a notebook or desktop computer in addition the company believes that in the future there is opportunity for acceptance of external storage in ce products as a way or expanding storage in these devices 

  other market opportunities 

  the company continuously evaluates opportunities to apply its knowledge of data storage technology beyond current markets for hard disk drives new business opportunities are evaluated for their direct impact on the company’s ability to increase the sale of hard disk drives the company monitors the development of new markets related to data or content storage and may from time to time offer new products or services to address appropriate new form factors interfaces or markets conversely depending on the development of such markets and the company’s ability to achieve its goals the company may from time to time withdraw from certain markets 

products 

  the company offers a broad line of hard disk drives designed for various markets western digital’s hard disk drives are marketed under the wd caviar® wd raptor® and wd scorpio tm brand names these hard disk drives service the desktop enterprise external hard disk drive and consumer electronics markets and can be found in products including but not limited to advanced performance desktop and workstations gaming consoles video surveillance equipment networking products enterprise storage and notebook computers 

  consumer electronics products the company offers design capabilities and hard disk drive technologies for consumer applications the company currently offers hard disk drive products designed for use in digital video recording 

5   products such as personal video recorders pvrs digital video recorders dvrs and satellite and cable settop boxes stbs these products are designed to meet the unique requirements of this specialized storageenabled market and the hard disk drives deliver the characteristics ce manufacturers seek most — quiet operation low temperature and power consumption specifications high reliability and optimized streaming capabilities the company also offers products for the video game console market in addition the company has plans to enter the 10inch hard disk drive market in the future the company anticipates that 10inch hard disk drive products could be used in a variety of handheld consumer devices such as mp3 players cameras and cell phones 

  mobile hard disk drive products hard disk drives used in mobile products typically include 25inch form factor drives for notebook computers although the desktop pc market accounts for a majority of hard disk drive sales unit shipments of hard disk drives for notebook computers are increasing in 2005 the company introduced its wd scorpio hard disk drive family consisting of 25inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 40 gb to 80 gb and a nominal rotation speed of 5400 rpm these products utilize the eide interface 

  desktop pc hard disk drive products wd hard disk drives designed for the desktop pc market currently consist of 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 40 gb to 400 gb and nominal rotation speeds of 7200 rpm these products utilize either the eide or sata interfaces providing high performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection the type of eide interface currently used in the company’s hard disk drives is ata100 which signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second which is the maximum specified data transition that can be sustained under ideal conditions the sata interface available in certain of the company’s hard disk drives enable transfer rates of up to 300 megabytes per second 

  enterprise hard disk drive products western digital currently offers multiple products to address enterprise market needs including the wd raptor and caviar raid edition re hard disk drive lines the wd raptor line is a 10000 rpm enterpriseclass drive with the sata interface for enterprise applications requiring high performance and high reliability the wd caviar re hard disk drive is a 7200 rpm drive with capacities ranging from 120 gb to 400 gb the wd caviar re hard disk drive includes both sata and eide interfaces and has enhanced reliability features and ratings when contrasted to our desktop products both wd raptor and wd caviar re drives may be used in but not limited to applications such as databases ecommerce and super computing in life science oil and gas and similar industries business records management email file serving web serving nearline storage medical records engineering data management video broadcasting and video security 

  external hard disk drive products western digital also sells a line of external hard disk drive products and related adapters that are designed to accommodate external storage interfaces including 1394 firewireilink usb and ethernet in general these interfaces provide a highspeed interface that can be used to add additional external portable storage capacity to desktop and laptop computers most new computers sold today include one or multiple of these high speed external interfaces thereby supporting the ability to quickly add external hard disk drive storage one of western digital’s external hard disk drive products now shipping is the wd passport a 80gb 5400 rpm portable 25inch hard disk drive 

technology and product development 

  hard disk drives are used to record store and retrieve digital data performance attributes of hard disk drives such as their ability to access and transmit data and storage capacity are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical hard disk drives and tapes and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard disk drive performance include 

 6   

   all of the company’s hard disk drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard disk drive are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board the head disk assembly includes the head media disks head positioning mechanism actuator and spindle motor these components are contained in a hard base plate protective package in a contaminationcontrolled environment the printed circuit board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector 

  the head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spindle motor disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 

  the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks that are divided into sectors the computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on logical track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

  industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the hard disk drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interface for desktop pcs is eide and the primary interface for enterprise systems is scsi as computer performance continues to improve the hard disk drive will need to deliver information faster than these interfaces can handle the company believes that the desktop pc industry plans to transition to higher speed interfaces such as sata to handle the higher data transfer rates the company currently offers its wd caviar products 7200 rpm drives with the sata interface and featuring capacities as large as 400 gb these products are designed for the pc workstation server and external storage markets the company believes that sata is also becoming a more popular interface in the enterprise market western digital currently offers its wd raptor hard disk drive a 10000 rpm enterpriseclass drive with the sata interface and the wd caviar re2 and re hard disk drives 7200 rpm drives manufactured to enterpriseclass standards and available with a sata interface 

  storage capacity of the hard disk drive as manufactured by western digital is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter as the areal density increases fewer disks andor heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity thus reducing product costs through reduced component requirements 

  head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density historically there have been rapid technological changes resulting in several generations of head technology in a relatively short period of time however in recent years the time has lengthened between changes in generations of head technology currently the desktop hard disk drive industry uses giant magnetoresistive head technology which allows significantly higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thinfilm head technology all of the company’s hard disk drive product offerings currently employ giant magnetoresistive head technology in addition significant development efforts have been undertaken across the industry to implement perpendicular recording technology the company anticipates using perpendicular recording heads in certain products in the future 

  the western digital product line generally leverages a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve the differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families and in some cases across product families which reduces 

7   exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows the company to achieve lower costs through economies of scale purchasing this platform strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models the company expects to continue to utilize this platform strategy as it continues to develop products for the mobile market and the emerging markets for hard disk drives specifically designed for handheld applications such as digital music players and audiovideo applications such as digital video recording devices 

  in addition to the development of the overall hard disk drive wd also spends considerable effort and expense in the development of wd head technology used in the majority of its hard disk drive products in general the design and manufacturing of wd heads consists of engineering and fabricating a read element for reading data from a disk a write element for writing data to a disk and slider the slider functions similar to an airplane wing and allows the read and write elements to fly over the surface of the disk drive and to land on either the disk substrate or a special ramp when power is not applied to the hard disk drive

  the company sells its products globally to original equipment manufacturers or “oems” distributors and retailers oems purchase the company’s hard disk drives and assemble them into the computer or other consumer electronic systems they build distributors typically sell the company’s hard disk drives to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers retailers typically sell the company’s hard disk drive products directly to endusers 

  original equipment manufacturers sales to oems accounted for 58 51 and 52 of the company’s revenue in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively during 2005 the company’s major oem customers included dell and hewlettpackard during 2005 and 2004 sales to dell accounted for 16 and 14 respectively of the company’s revenue during 2003 sales to dell and hewlettpackard accounted for 20 and 13 of revenue respectively the company believes that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve its strong relationships with the leading oems 

  oems evaluate and select their hard disk drive suppliers based on a number of factors including overall quality and reliability storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability they typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of hard disk drives and once an oem has chosen its qualified hard disk drive vendors for a given product it generally will purchase hard disk drives from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with oems qualifications a hard disk drive supplier must consistently offer hard disk drives featuring leading technology quality reliability and acceptable capacity per disk suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of each new generation of high quality and reliable hard disk drives to quickly achieve high volume production a hard disk drive supplier must have access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities 

  many of the company’s oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” in which the oem does not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” in which the oem contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the oem’s instructions for certain oems the company maintains a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations 

  for an additional discussion of the need to adapt to customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

  distributors the company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products to small computer manufacturers resellers dealers and systems integrators distributors accounted for approximately 36 42 and 40 of the company’s revenue for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with the company for purchase and redistribution of product the company grants its distributors limited price protection rights 

8     retailers the company sells its retailpackaged products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores and authorizes sales through distributors to smaller retailers retailers accounted for approximately 6 7 and 8 of the company’s revenue for each of 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the company’s current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe the retail channel complements the company’s other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for the company and its products retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade” and data backup sectors in which endusers purchase and install products to upgrade their computers and externally store their data for backup purposes the company grants its retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis the company also sells its retailpackaged products through the internet at its web site 

  the company maintains sales offices in selected parts of the world including the major geographies of the americas asia pacific europe and the middle east field application engineering is provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts and localized enduser technical support services are provided within the united states canada europe and asia the company’s localized enduser technical support is currently supplied by employees and third party providers through telephone support and via the company’s web site 

  the company’s international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 65 63 and 59 of the company’s revenue for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

  for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and significant customer information see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  the company’s marketing and advertising functions are performed both internally and through outside firms advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials are targeted to various reseller and enduser categories western digital utilizes both consumer media and to a lesser extent trade publications the company has programs under which qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain marketing expenditures western digital also maintains customer relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing endusers with information and support through its web site 

competition 

  the company competes primarily with manufacturers of hard disk drives for desktop pc mobile enterprise and ce products the company’s competitors in the hard disk drive market include seagate technology maxtor corporation fujitsu limited hitachi global storage technologies samsung electronics incorporated and toshiba corporation 

  the hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive with hard disk drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard disk drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard disk drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies between different customer and market segments the company believes that it is generally competitive in all of these factors 

  the company believes that there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products therefore the company believes that it cannot differentiate its hard disk drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly the company differentiates itself by focusing on high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating into its hard disk drives desirable product performance attributes such performance attributes focus on seek times data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics and data recovery in addition the company emphasizes nonproduct related attributes including rapid response with its customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction the company also relies on the strength of the western digital brand name with valueadded resellers and solution providers to whom the 

9   company sells its hard disk drive products directly and indirectly the company believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard disk drive particularly in a rapidly changing technology environment 

  advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than the company’s hard disk drive products highspeed semiconductor memory could compete with the company’s hard disk drive products in the future semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic hard disk drives but currently is not competitive from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance attributes than hard disk drives it has lower “write” performance attributes flash memory could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard disk drives 

  for an additional discussion of competition see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

service and warranty 

  western digital generally warrants its newly manufactured hard disk drives against defects in materials and workmanship for periods of from one to five years from the date of sale depending on the type of product the company’s warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the hard disk drive the company has engaged third parties in australia brazil canada china germany hungary india korea russia singapore thailand and the united arab emirates to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned hard disk drives for the company’s customers in addition the company processes tests and recertifies returned hard disk drives at its own facility in the united states 

manufacturing 

  western digital believes that it has significant knowhow unique product manufacturing process and human resources to continue to be successful and have the ability to grow as necessary its manufacturing operations to be competitive western digital must manufacture high quality hard disk drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs the company strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields and reliable products while insisting that its suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of western digital’s hard disk drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key supplier relationships by establishing close relationships with its strategic component suppliers the company believes it is able to access bestofclass manufacturing quality in addition the company believes that its sourcing strategy currently enables it to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve 

  hard disk drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient utilization of the “clean room” layout in order to reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing environment the company’s clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells 

  the company manufactures hard disk drives in malaysia and thailand the company continually evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs for example during 2002 in response to an increase in demand and in order to capitalize on the local supplier base the company completed the acquisition of a thailand manufacturing facility the company continually evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs 

  in july 2003 the company purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite corporation formerly one of the company’s suppliers of heads including its wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and its slider fabrication facility in bang pain thailand these assets are upgraded and enhanced as necessary to meet the demands of newer technologies consistent with the company’s hard disk drive production facilities the company uses these facilities to 

10   design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads head gimbal assemblies “hgas” and head stack assemblies “hsas” for use in hard disk drives it manufactures 

  for an additional discussion of manufacturing see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

research and development 

  the company devotes substantial resources to development of new products and improvement of existing products the company focuses its engineering efforts on coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in order to bring its products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses totaled 239 million 201 million and 135 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  for further discussion of product development see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

materials and supplies 

  the principal components currently used in the manufacture of the company’s hard disk drives are magnetic heads and related hsas media controllers spindle motors and mechanical parts used in the head disk assembly in addition to custom semiconductor devices the company also uses standard semiconductor components such as logic memory and microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a wide variety of other parts including printed circuit boards connectors cables and other interconnect technology 

  the company designs and manufactures a substantial portion of the heads required for the hard disk drives it manufactures the company also purchases a portion of these components from third party suppliers during 2005 the company bought giant magnetoresistive heads from alps electric co ltd and tdk corporation’s subsidiary sae magnetics ltd 

  the company acquires all of the remaining components for its products from third party suppliers the company generally obtains multiple suppliers for each of its component requirements however in some instances for business reasons the company is sole sourced for example during 2005 the company’s media requirements were purchased from several outside vendors including fuji electric hoya corp komag inc and showa denko kk the company has volume purchase agreements with komag inc and showa denko kk under which the company is obligated to purchase from each supplier and each supplier is obligated to sell to the company certain specified media volumes in accordance with the terms in the agreements 

  some components are currently solesourced for example some custom integrated circuit devices for certain products are currently solesourced from stmicroelectronics and marvell semiconductor inc because of their custom nature these products require significant designin periods and long lead times there has been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased integration of various separate circuits the company expects this trend to continue in the area of custom integrated circuits for hard disk drives 

  for an additional discussion of component supplies see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

backlog 

  historically a substantial portion of the company’s orders has been for shipments of hard disk drives within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order the company generally negotiates pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to the company with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition many of the company’s sales to oems are made under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead the company receives a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and the customer is invoiced upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse 

11   therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the company’s revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods 

patents licenses and proprietary information 

  the company owns numerous patents and has many patent applications in process the company believes that although its patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of its products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of its personnel accordingly the patents held and applied for do not assure the company’s future success 

  in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights the company considers elements of its product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential the company believes that its nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of its process technology is an important factor in its success western digital relies upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect its proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the company conducts business also may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states 

  the company relies on certain technology that is licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its products the company believes that it has adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to its own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard disk drive industry 

  for additional discussion of intellectual property see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

environmental regulation 

  the company is subject to a variety of regulations in connection with its operations it believes that it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for its operations 

employees 

  as of july 1 2005 the company employed a total of 23161 employees worldwide this represents an increase in headcount of approximately 33 since july 2 2004 and an increase of approximately 101 since june 27 2003 the increase is primarily the result of increased production in the company’s manufacturing facilities the company’s expansion of its product offerings and the company’s acquisition of readrite’s assets in july 2003 

  many of the company’s employees are highly skilled and the company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly the company offers employee benefit programs which it believes are in the aggregate approximately comparable to those offered by its competitors despite these programs the company has along with most of its competitors experienced difficulty at times in hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel in addition the company has utilized consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited the company has never experienced a work stoppage none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor organization and the company considers its employee relations to be good

the company 

  western digital corporation designs develops manufactures and sells hard disk drives a hard disk drive is a device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks to allow fast access to data hard disk drives are one of the key components found in most computers and data storage subsystems 

  the company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop personal computers “pcs” notebook computers enterprise applications such as servers workstations network attached storage and storage area networks and in consumer electronics “ce” products such as personaldigital video recorders “dvrs” and satellite and cable settop boxes “stbs” in addition the company’s hard disk drives are used in external hard disk drive products that feature high speed buses such as 1394 firewireilink tm  universal serial bus “usb” and ethernet 

  hard disk drives provide nonvolatile data storage which means that the data is not lost when power is no longer applied to the device the company’s hard disk drive products currently include 35inch and 25inch form factor drives the 35inch form factor drives have capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes “gb” to 400 gb nominal rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” and serial advanced technology attachment “sata” the 25inch form factor drives have capacities ranging from 40 gb to 80 gb nominal rotation speed of 5400 rpms and offer the eide interface in addition the company has plans to enter the 10inch hard disk drive market in the future the company anticipates that 10 inch hard disk drive products could be used in a variety of handheld consumer devices such as mp3 players cameras and cell phones 

  the company sells its products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers “oems” for inclusion in computer systems or subsystems and to distributors resellers and retailers the company’s hard disk drive products are currently manufactured in malaysia and thailand for geographical financial data see the company’s consolidated financial statements and note 9 thereto included in this annual report on form 10k 

market overview 

  for calendar year 2004 the company believes that the total market for hard disk drives was more than 300 million units or almost 24 billion over half of these unit shipments were to the desktop pc market thus total hard disk drive unit growth depends greatly on developments in the pc market wd believes that the demand for hard disk drives in the pc market will continue to grow in part due to 

 17     the company believes the rate of hard disk drive unit growth in the desktop pc market is affected by several factors including maturing pc markets in north america and western europe an increase in firsttime buyers of pcs in eastern europe and asia the lengthening of pc replacement cycles and an increasing preference for notebook systems 

  the company expects that the mobile computing market which is primarily notebook computers to grow faster than the desktop pc market due to customer preference in the next three years western digital entered the mobile hard disk drive market in october 2004 commencing volume production of its wd scorpio tm family of 25inch hard disk drives for notebooks 

  as the market for consumer applications expands additional investments by the company will be required for example ce products such as handheld digital audio players currently utilize sub25inch form factor hard disk drives in january 2005 western digital announced it has plans to enter the miniature hard disk drive market with a 10inch 6gigabyte product in addition while ce products may require hard disk drives that are similar in nature to desktop hard disk drives these products have often required specialized features or functions driving additional development versus desktop products 

  the enterprise market for hard disk drives focuses on customers that make workstations servers network attached storage devices storage area networks and other computing systems or subsystems western digital serves this market through its application of the sata interface the sata interface contains many of the same benefits of the smallcomputersystemsinterface or scsi — the predominant interface currently used in most enterprise hard disk drive applications the company believes that the use of the sata interfaces in enterprise hard disk drives is growing 

results of operations 

   in 2005 western digital’s net revenue increased by 19 to 36 billion on unit shipments of 614 million as compared to 483 million in 2004 in 2005 21 of wd’s revenue was derived from nondesktop pc sources including ce products enterprise applications notebook pcs and retail sales as compared to 14 in 2004 gross margin increased to 162 from 152 in 2004 operating income increased by 42 million to 197 million which included the impact of a 19 million charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit operating margins increased to 54 as a percentage of net revenue in 2005 compared with 51 in 2004 western digital generated 461 million in cash flow from operations in 2005 compared with 190 million in 2004 finishing the year with 598 million in cash and shortterm investments an increase of 221 million from the prior year 

  historically industry unit shipments have increased 5 to 10 between the june and september quarters the company anticipates traditional seasonal demand trends for the hard disk drive industry in the september 2005 quarter wd also expects to continue to benefit from its growing participation in the ce market and the ongoing volume ramp of its scorpio 25inch hard disk drives 

   the following table sets forth for the periods indicated summary information from the company’s statements of income in millions 

 18   

   net revenue was 36 billion for 2005 an increase of 19 or 592 million from 2004 total unit shipments increased to 614 million for the year as compared to 483 million for the prior year this unit increase resulted from the company’s higher desktop market share stronger overall demand for hard disk drives in the desktop pc market and wd’s increasing focus on the nondesktop pc market for example wd shipped 66 million units to the ce market in 2005 as compared to 28 million units in 2004 the growth in total unit shipments was partially offset by a 4 per unit decline in average selling prices “asps” to 59 per unit for 2005 

  revenue contribution by geographic region for 2005 was 38 from the americas 29 from europe and 33 from asia compared to 41 30 and 29 respectively for 2004 and 48 30 and 22 respectively for 2003 these changes reflect the company’s continued focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic markets primarily in asia 

  revenue contribution by sales channel for 2005 was 58 from oems 36 from distributors and 6 from the retail channel compared to 51 42 and 7 respectively for 2004 and 52 40 and 8 respectively for 2003 wd’s revenue contribution from oem’s increased in 2005 due to higher sales to the nondesktop pc markets which are serviced primarily by oem’s 

  net revenue increased 328 million or 12 in 2004 from 2003 this increase in net revenue was primarily due to the company’s improved market share as well as an increase in demand for hard disk drives in the pc market unit shipments increased to 483 million in 2004 from 397 million in 2003 while asps decreased to 63 per unit in 2004 from 68 per unit in 2003 

   gross margin percentage increased to 162 for 2005 from 152 for 2004 the company’s 2004 gross margin was impacted by startup expenses and other charges totaling 18 million relating to the company’s head manufacturing operations acquired in july 2003 the increase in gross margin percentage over the prior year was also impacted by continuing improvements in quality manufacturing cost efficiencies and product mix partially offset by unit price declines the gross margin percentage for 2003 was 163 which included the impact of a 19 million charge for the settlement of litigation the decrease in gross margin percentage from 2003 to 2004 was primarily a result of the 18 million of startup expenses incurred in 2004 relating to the acquisition of the company’s head manufacturing operations as well as aggressive pricing pressures wd was able to partially offset the 2004 impact of these pricing conditions and startup related costs with the ongoing accretive benefit of its head manufacturing operations 

   total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” were 108 of net revenue in 2005 as compared to 101 of net revenue in 2004 and 94 of net revenue in 2003 operating expenses are expected to increase slightly for the first fiscal quarter of 2006 as a result of the company’s continued investment in the expansion of its product and technology portfolio and the costs associated with expensing stock options 

  rd expense was 239 million 201 million and 135 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase of 38 million in rd expense in 2005 over 2004 was primarily related to development of new product platforms in support of wd’s entry into new markets expenditures for advanced head technologies and an increase of 26 million in employee incentive compensation programs the increase of 66 million in rd in 2004 over 2003 was due to headdesign mobile and enterprise platform development as well as a 26 million charge for acquired inprocess research and development related to the readrite asset acquisition 

  sga expense was 154 million 106 million and 121 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the 48 million increase in sga expense in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to an expansion of sales resources to support increasing pc demand in certain geographic regions and the growing mobile and ce markets an increase of 15 million in employee incentive compensation programs and a 19 million charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit the 15 million decrease in sga expense in 2004 from 2003 was primarily related to a reduction in employee incentive compensation programs and continuing cost reductions

   net interest and other income was 5 million 0 and 3 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this includes net investment gains of 4 million in 2003 excluding these net gains net interest and other income expense was 5 million 0 and 1 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in net interest income in 2005 over 2004 was primarily due to a higher average cash and shortterm investments balance as well as an increase in the rates of return on investments yielding higher interest income in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase in net interest income in 2004 over net interest expense in 2003 was primarily due to the company’s redemption of its convertible debentures during the third quarter of 2003 resulting in lower interest expense in 2004 

   income tax expense was 4 million 4 million and 8 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 19 25 and 40 for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively differences between the effective tax rates and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2019 the 2005 effective tax rate benefited by approximately 07 from the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies the decrease in income tax expense from 2003 to 2004 is primarily related to lower overall earnings in 2004 and a more favorable mix of earnings within certain tax jurisdictions 

liquidity and capital resources 

  western digital ended fiscal 2005 with total cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 598 million an increase of 220 million from july 2 2004 the company’s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds a large portion of western digital’s available funds is invested in auction rate securities which are shortterm investments in bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days the following table summarizes the results of the company’s statements of cash flows for the threeyear periods ended july 1 2005 july 2 2004 and june 27 2003 

 

   net cash provided by operating activities during 2005 was 461 million as compared to 190 million during 2004 and 258 million for 2003 cash flow from operations consists of net income adjusted for noncash charges plus or minus working capital changes this represents the company’s principal source of cash net cash provided by working capital changes was 128 million for 2005 as compared to net cash used to fund working capital of 89 million for 2004 and net cash provided by working capital of 45 million for 2003 

20     western digital’s working capital requirements depend upon the effective management of its cash conversion cycle which measures how quickly a company can convert its products into cash through sales the cash conversion cycles for 2005 2004 and 2003 were as follows 

   the improvement in the cash conversion cycle for 2005 was primarily due to better alignment in the timing of the company’s inventory build and sales schedules cash flow from operations for 2005 also benefited from an increase in other expenses that did not require the use of cash in 2005 the decrease in the 2004 cash conversion cycle as compared to 2003 was primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance associated with changes in the company’s mix of customers and higher work in process inventory associated with the head manufacturing operations cash flow from operations for 2004 was also impacted by the payment of a 45 million litigation settlement 

   net cash used in investing activities for 2005 was 314 million as compared to 259 million for 2004 and 59 million for 2003 during 2005 cash used in investing activities consisted of 233 million for capital expenditures and 81 million for shortterm investments the net cash used in investing activities for 2004 consisted of 132 million for capital expenditures 95 million for the readrite asset acquisition and 32 million for shortterm investments the increase in capital expenditures in 2005 was primarily a result of assets purchased to upgrade the company’s head manufacturing capabilities increased desktop and mobile hard disk drive production capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets the increase in shortterm investments in 2005 was a result of additional investments in auction rate securities the 2003 investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures the increase in capital expenditures in 2004 was primarily for assets purchased to upgrade the company’s head manufacturing capabilities increase desktop hard disk drive production capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets for 2006 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 275 million to 300 million this increase in capital expenditures is expected to consist primarily of investments in advanced head technologies new product platforms and capacity for wd’s broadening and growing product portfolio 

   net cash used in financing activities for 2005 was 7 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 21 million for 2004 and net cash used in financing activities of 30 million for 2003 the net cash used in financing activities in 2005 consisted of 45 million used for common stock repurchases and 20 million for debt payments partially offset by 58 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans the net cash provided by financing activities for 2004 consisted primarily of 24 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans and 14 million in net proceeds from longterm debt partially offset by 16 million used for common stock repurchases the net cash used by financing activities for 2003 consisted primarily of 68 million used for redemption of the company’s remaining convertible debentures partially offset by 44 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans 

21   capital commitments 

  the following is a summary of the company’s significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at july 1 2005 in millions 

  

 

   the company has a 125 million credit facility “senior credit facility” consisting of a revolving credit line subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation and a term loan of 38 million both the revolving credit facility and the term loan mature on september 19 2008 and are secured by the company’s accounts receivable inventory 65 of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets for the year ended july 1 2005 the company had no borrowings on the revolving credit line and the average variable rate on the company’s term loan was 45 

  the senior credit facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains specific financial covenants the company is required to maintain an available liquidity level of 300 million at the end of each quarter available liquidity is defined as cash plus eligible trade receivables as of july 1 2005 the company was in compliance with this covenant should the company’s available liquidity be less than 300 million the company would then be subject to minimum ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization requirements and capital expenditure limitations 

  the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of approximately 3 million principal payments made on the term loan increase the amount of revolving credit available at july 1 2005 85 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line and the company had 3 million in outstanding letters of credit 

   in the normal course of business the company enters into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard disk drive components used to manufacture the company’s products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components in some cases the company may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process 

  the company has entered into longterm purchase agreements with various component suppliers the commitments are subject to minimum quality requirements in addition the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered and future price negotiations the estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in “purchase obligations” in the table above 

  the company enters into from time to time other longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors generally future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on the company’s overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above see below under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” for a discussion of these commitments 

22   

   the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for the company’s current forward exchange contract commitments 

   in the ordinary course of business the company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers vendors lessors business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to losses arising out of our breach of such agreements services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers the company maintains director and officer insurance which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to indemnify its directors and officers in certain circumstances 

  it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically the company has not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 

   wd announced a stock repurchase program on may 5 2004 under the program the company may purchase on the open market up to 100 million of its common stock depending on market conditions and other corporate considerations stock repurchases are expected to be funded principally by operating cash flow during 2005 wd repurchased 48 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 45 million in addition between july 2 2005 and september 9 2005 the company repurchased 04 million shares of common stock at a cost of 6 million since the inception of the program and through september 9 2005 the company has repurchased 71 million shares for a total cost of 67 million including commissions wd may continue to repurchase its stock as it deems appropriate and market conditions allow 

  western digital believes its current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that the senior credit facility will continue to be available to the company also wd’s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” the company currently anticipates that it will continue to utilize its liquidity and cash flows to improve the efficiency and capability of its existing hard disk drive and head manufacturing operations 

critical accounting policies 

  the company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities the company has adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve management’s judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

   in accordance with standard industry practice western digital has agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other incentive programs in accordance with current accounting standards the company recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery 

23   to resellers and records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers adjustments are based on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers as well as historical pricing information if endmarket demand for hard disk drives declines significantly the company may have to increase sellthrough incentive payments to resellers resulting in an increase in price protection allowances which could adversely impact operating results 

  western digital establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition the company routinely analyzes the different receivable aging categories and its bad debt loss history and establishes reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on the company’s historical levels of bad debt losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due or if the overall loss history of the company changes significantly an adjustment in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could affect operating results 

  western digital records provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized the company bases these provisions on existing product return notifications as well as historical returns by product type see “warranty” if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return provision would be required which could negatively affect operating results 

   western digital records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized warranty covers costs of repair or replacement of the hard disk drive over the warranty period which generally ranges from one to five years the company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty which include specific detail on hard disk drives in the field by product type historical field return rates and costs to repair if actual product return rates or costs to repair returned products differ significantly from current expectations a change in the warranty provision would be required for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to preexisting warranty provisions refer to part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 5 “commitments and contingencies” included in this annual report on form 10k 

   inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value inventory writedowns are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances 

  the company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and reduces inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the company’s products which may require an increase in inventory balance adjustments that could negatively affect operating results 

   western digital applies statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies accordingly the company accrues loss contingencies when management in consultation with its legal advisors concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable refer to part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 “legal proceedings” included in this annual report on form 10k the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates 

24   

   western digital’s deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are fully reserved due to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized this determination is based on the weight of available evidence the most significant of which is the company’s loss history in the related tax jurisdictions should this determination change in the future some amount of deferred tax assets could be recognized resulting in a tax benefit or a reduction of future tax expense the company records estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies are probable and can be reasonably estimated however the actual liability in any such tax contingencies may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially adjust previously recorded tax liabilities 

   in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the definition of “so abnormal” sfas no 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 151 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued revised statement sfas no 123 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which supersedes apb opinion no 25 and replaces the current sfas no 123 sfas no 123r requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards and provides guidance on the valuation methods used in determining the estimated fair value the provisions of sfas no 123r will be effective beginning with the company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2006 under sfas no 123r compensation expense for existing awards where the requisite service period has not been completed by the effective date will be charged to expense over the remaining service period using the same fair value currently calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 123 for fiscal year 2005 the proforma net impact of stock option expense as reported in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements was approximately 25 million the company is currently in the process of determining the impact of sfas 123r on its 2006 financial statements the actual effect of adopting sfas 123r will be dependent on several factors including the levels and timing of future sharebased payment grants the assumed award forfeiture rate and the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the service period 

  in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated fin 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of fin 47 to have a material impact on its financial statements 

risk factors that may affect future results 

   the hard disk drive industry historically has experienced declining asps although the rate of decline has moderated in recent years there can be no assurance that this trend will continue our asps tend to decline when competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share our asps also decline when there is a shift in the mix of product sales and sales of lower priced products increase relative to those of higher priced products 

25   

   to achieve consistent success with our customers who manufacturer computers systems and consumer electronic products we must balance several key attributes such as timetomarket timetovolume quality cost service price and a broad product portfolio if we fail to 

 our operating results could be adversely affected 

   product life cycles have been extending since the middle of calendar year 2002 due in large part to a decrease in the rate of hard disk drive areal density growth however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue if longer product life cycles continue we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product in order to maintain competitive pricing for such product this may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results if product life cycles shorten it may be more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

   new products in the desktop hard disk drive market may require higher areal densities than previous product generations posing formidable technical and manufacturing challenges higher areal densities require existing head technology to be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on a single disk in addition our introduction of new products during a technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns our failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results in addition technology improvements may require us to reduce the price on existing products to remain competitive 

   storage capacity of the hard disk drive as manufactured by us is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk generally the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter historically we have been able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through increases in areal density increases in areal 

26   density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore may result in a lower component cost however because increases in areal density have become more difficult in the hard disk drive industry such increases may require increases in component costs in addition other opportunities to reduce costs may not continue at historical rates our inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our operating results 

   historically the industry has experienced periods of increased areal density growth rates although in recent years there has been a decrease in the rate of areal density growth if industry conditions return to periods of increased growth rates the rate of increase in areal density may exceed the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity this could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with more lowercost singlesurface drives thereby decreasing our revenue as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity our asps could decline which could adversely affect our results of operations 

   over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems if we are not able to offer a competitively priced hard disk drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results 

  the market for hard disk drives is also fragmenting into a variety of devices and products many industry analysts expect as do we that as communications are increasingly converted to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue to converge and hard disk drives will be found in many ce products other than computers 

  in addition we expect that the consumer market for multimedia applications including audiovideo products incorporating a hard disk drive will continue to grow however because this market remains relatively new accurate forecasts for future growth remain challenging moreover some of the devices such as personal video recorders and digital video recorders or other products outside of the ce market may require attributes not currently offered in our products which have resulted in a need to expend capital to develop new interfaces form factors technical specifications or hard disk drive features increasing our overall operational expense without corresponding incremental revenue at this stage if we are not successful in using our hard disk drive technology and expertise to develop new products for the emerging ce market or if we are required to incur significant costs in developing such products it may harm our operating results 

   to remain a significant supplier of hard disk drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard disk drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch hard disk drives for the desktop computer and ce markets and we also offer 25inch form factor hard disk drives for the mobile market however demand for hard disk drives may shift to products in smaller form factors which our competitors may already offer we recently announced our entry into the sub25inch hard disk drive market with a family of 10inch drives which we expect to ship in the future we face various challenges in manufacturing a 10inch hard disk drive because it requires the development of new manufacturing technologies and processes if we are not able to adequately address these challenges our expected shipment of this product may be delayed resulting in a delay in our ability to realize revenue from this product 

  in addition the enterprise and desktop pc markets are transitioning from the pata interface to higher speed interfaces such as sata to handle higher data transfer rates we currently offer sata products however the transition of technology and the introduction of new products are challenging and create risks for example acceptance of the sata interface may not continue to grow or customers may choose to purchase alternative interfaces that may not be compatible with future generations of sata hard disk drives moreover our customers may require new sata features that we may not be able to deliver in a timely and cost effective manner 

  while we continue to develop new products and look to expand into other applications the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp market acceptance effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new 

27   products may have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products if we fail to successfully develop and manufacture new products customers may decrease the amount of our products that they purchase and we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products or who use their dominance in the enterprise or mobile market to encourage sales of hard disk drives 

   we began shipping 25inch form factor hard disk drives for the mobile market during calendar year 2004 although many of our customers who purchase 35inch form factor hard disk drives also purchase the 25inch form factor drives the markets are characterized by different competitors different sales channels and different overall requirements if we are unable to adapt to these differences we would have a competitive disadvantage to companies that are successful in this regard and our business and financial results could suffer in addition if we incur significant costs in manufacturing and selling the 25inch and sub25inch form factor hard disk drives and if we are unable to recover those costs from sales of the products then we may not be able to compete successfully in this market and our operating results may suffer 

   we sell our retailpackaged products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores and ce stores and authorize sales through distributors to other retailers our current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe we are facing increased competition from other companies for shelf space at major retailers which could result in lower gross margins if we fail to successfully maintain our market share in north america our operating results may be adversely affected in certain markets we are trying to grow market share and in the process may face strong competition which could result in lower gross margins we will continue to introduce new products in the retail market that incorporate our disk drives there can be no assurance that these products gain market acceptance and if they do not our operating results could suffer 

   under our business model we do not manufacture any of the component parts used in our hard disk drives other than heads as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our major component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers each of which employs variations on technology which can impact for example feasible combinations of heads and media components in august 2003 we settled litigation we were engaged in with a supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard disk drives as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our profitability was at risk until another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

   because we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain hard disk drive components and manufacturing equipment an increase in the cost of such components or equipment an extended shortage of required components or equipment failure of a key supplier’s business process or the failure of key suppliers to remain in business adjust to market conditions or to meet our quality yield or production requirements could significantly harm our operating results our future operating results may also depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and their ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements a number of the components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers and may be used across multiple product lines in addition some of the components or component types used in our products are used in other devices such as mobile telephones and digital cameras if there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component or component type from several high volume industries resulting in a supply reduction or a component is otherwise in short supply or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component for 

28   example the hard disk drive industry is currently facing a tightness in the availability of media rotating magnetic disks components we may experience production delays if we are unable to obtain the necessary components or sufficient quantities of components if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

  to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these components as a result we may be subject to cancellation charges if we cancel orders which may occur when we make technology transitions in addition we may enter into contractual commitments with certain component suppliers in an effort to increase and stabilize the supply of those components and enable us to purchase such components at favorable prices these commitments may require us to buy a substantial number of components from the supplier or make significant cash advances to the supplier 

  in addition certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or testing processes is available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment uses materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

   the cost and availability of certain commodity materials used to manufacture hard disk drives and key components is critical to our success shortages of such materials such as steel and aluminum and the rising cost of oil increase our costs and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to pass such increased costs through to our customers 

   currently the hard disk drive industry uses giant magnetoresistive head technology which allows significantly higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thinfilm head technology however the industry is developing new recording technologies that may enable greater recording densities than currently available using magnetoresistive head technology including perpendicular current perpendiculartoplane and tunneling junction technology if the industry experiences a fundamental shift in recording technology hard disk drive manufacturers would need to timely adjust their designs and processes to accommodate the new technology in order to remain competitive as a result we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies media and tools to remain competitive we may also become more dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components that accommodate the new technology these results would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

   our vertical integration of head manufacturing has resulted in a fundamental change in our operating structure as we are now manufacturing heads for use in the hard disk drives we manufacture consequently we make more capital investments than we would if we were not vertically integrated and carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than assumed in our prior financial business model if the overall level of production decreases for any reason and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match sales our head manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our results of operations we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components especially hard disk drive media that is optimized to work with our heads 

  in addition we may incur additional risks including 

 29   

   if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

   as a result of our head manufacturing operations we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads used in the hard disk drives we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head technologies developed by other head manufacturers there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads for products using perpendicular recording technology or other future technologies we also may not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using such technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads we manufacture in addition we may not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs for example the company anticipates using perpendicular recording heads in certain products in the future if we fail to develop new technologies such as perpendicular recording in a timely manner or if we encounter quality problems with the heads we manufacture and if we do not have access to external sources of supply that incorporate new technologies we would have a competitive disadvantage to companies that are successful in this regard and our business and financial results could suffer 

   our hard disk drives are manufactured in facilities in malaysia and thailand in addition we operate a head wafer fabrication and research and development facility in fremont california and a slider fabrication head gimbal assembly head stack assembly and research and development facility in thailand a fire flood earthquake or other disaster condition or event such as a power outage that adversely affects any of these facilities or our ability to manufacture could result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results 

   we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations including 

   because we manufacture our products abroad our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the thai baht and of the malaysian ringgit may negatively impact our operating results 

30     the thai baht is a free floating currency while the malaysian ringgit exchange rate policy recently defined by the malaysian government is one of a managed float we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward contracts however these contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place currently we hedge the thai baht euro and british pound sterling with forward contracts 

  there has been a trend toward a weakening us dollar relative to most foreign currencies if this trend continues the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated 

   we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers to be considered for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with our new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume computer manufacturers most of which continue to consolidate their share of the pc market if product life cycles continue to be extended due to a decrease in the rate of areal density growth we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could harm our competitive position these risks are increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current generation products 

   the price of hard disk drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence we also face competition from other companies that produce alternative storage technologies like flash memory these factors taken together may result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants in addition product recalls can lead to a loss of market share which could adversely affect our operating results 

   it may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology manufacturing technology or process technology which may allow them to offer products or services that have a significant advantage over the products and services that we offer advantages could be in capacity performance reliability serviceability or other attributes if we are unable to match these technology advantages due to the proprietary nature of the technology limitations on process capability or other factors we could be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors 

  advances in magnetic optical semiconductor or other data storage technologies also could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products highspeed semiconductor memory could compete with the company’s hard disk drive products in the future semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic hard disk drives but currently is not competitive from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance than hard disk drives it has lower “write” performance flash memory could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard disk drives if these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity we could be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those products 

  in addition if our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost structure for manufacturing hard disk drives by moving manufacturing facilities to advantageous locations or through other restructuring activities and we are unable to 

31   match their cost structure we could be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors as they may be able to sell hard disk drives at lower margins while remaining profitable 

   some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their revenue from business units outside the hard disk drive industry because they do not depend solely on sales of hard disk drives to achieve profitability they may be able to sell hard disk drives at lower margins and still remain profitable in addition if these competitors can increase sales of non hard disk drive products to the same customers they may benefit from selling their hard disk drives at low margins our results of operations may be adversely affected if we can not successfully compete with these companies 

   the hard disk drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  we are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would likely increase our costs and harm our operating results 

   our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology despite safeguards to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

   our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard disk drive industry is intense volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel or skilled employees who have been granted stock options if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key personnel or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed 

32   

   demand for our hard disk drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard disk drives in any given period as a result the hard disk drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price competition if intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenue and gross margins 

   the hard disk drive industry faces difficulties in accurately forecasting market and customer demand for its products the variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part on these forecasts if our forecasts exceed actual market demand or if market demand decreases significantly from our forecasts then we could experience periods of product oversupply and price decreases which could impact our financial performance if our forecasts do not meet actual market demand of if market demand increases significantly beyond our forecasts then we may not be able to satisfy customer product needs which could result in a loss of market share if our competitors are able to meet customer demands 

  we also use forecasts in making decisions regarding investment of our resources for example as the hard disk drive industry transitions from the pata interface to the sata interface we may invest more resources in the development of products using the sata interface if our forecasts regarding the replacement of the pata interface with the sata interface are inaccurate we may not have products available to meet our customers’ needs 

  in addition although we receive forecasts from our customers they are not obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts we consider these forecasts in determining our component needs and our inventory requirements if we fail to accurately forecast our customers’ product demands we may have inadequate or excess inventory of our products or components which could adversely affect our operating results 

   a majority of our revenue comes from a few customers for example during 2005 one customer dell accounted for 16 of our revenue and sales to our top 10 customers including dell accounted for 46 of revenue these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs or if a key customer suffers financial hardship then our operating results would likely be harmed in addition if customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue 

   we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries for example the european union has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive “rohs” rohs prohibits the use of certain substances including lead in certain products including hard disk drives put on the market after july 1 2006 similar legislation may be enacted 

33   in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products we will need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted and that our component suppliers also timely comply with such laws and regulations if we fail to timely comply with such legislation our customers may refuse to purchase our products which would have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we could incur substantial costs in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations and we could also be subject to governmental fines and liability to our customers if we were found to be in violation of these laws if we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws or if we are subject to significant capital expenses in connection with a violation of these laws our financial condition or operating results could suffer 

   we warrant our products for up to five years we test our hard disk drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product in addition a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers including our oem customers 

  our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for misuse improper installation alteration accident or mishandling while in the possession of someone other than the company we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

   some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies that provide manufacturing services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk any credit losses we may suffer as a result of this increased risk would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

   the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility including the war in iraq have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

   we use enterprise resource planning software in the operation of our business and maintenance of business and financial data related to our daily operations we are in the process of upgrading this software and we anticipate transitioning to new enterprise resource planning software during the next year we may experience unexpected 

34   difficulties in transitioning to the new software including difficulties related to the failure or inefficient operation of the new software such difficulties or failures could result in our inability to access business and financial information stored on the system or the loss of such information any inability to access or loss of such information as a result of the transition or otherwise could affect our daily operations including our ability to ship products and invoice our customers which could have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

   we often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results prior to the end of the quarter in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

   we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions key estimates and assumptions for us include 

 

   the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock 

 35   

   in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 

  securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

   due to the risks described herein in the future we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital expenditures expansion or acquisition activity working capital and research and development we have a credit facility which matures on september 19 2008 if we decide to increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development efforts or if results of operations do not meet our expectations we could require additional debt or equity financing however we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available to us or available on acceptable terms an equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

disclosure about foreign currency risk 

  although the majority of the company’s transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations the resulting impact from these hedge contracts is to offset a majority of the currency gains and losses in the company’s local currency expenses the contract maturity dates do not exceed six months the company does not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes currently the company focuses on hedging its foreign currency risk related to the thai baht the euro and the british pound sterling thai baht contracts are designated as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” while all other contracts are designated as fair value hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 52 “foreign currency translation” 

36     as of july 1 2005 the company had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate 

  

   in 2005 2004 and 2003 total realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to the consolidated financial statements 

disclosure about other market risks 

   at the option of the company borrowings under the senior credit facility would bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin if libor or the base rate increases the company’s interest payments would also increase at july 1 2005 the company had a 38 million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the senior credit facility would increase interest expense by approximately 04 million annually

 item 1 business tableend general   western digital corporation the “company” or “western digital” designs develops manufactures and markets hard disk drives one of the key components found in most computers and data storage subsystems hard disk drives are also found in a number of consumer electronics “ce” devices a hard disk drive is a device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks to allow fast access to nonvolatile data for computing needs the company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop personal computers “pcs” enterprise servers network attached storage devices an expanding list of ce products such as video game consoles personaldigital video recorders satellite and cable settop boxes and as external storage devices the company’s hard disk drive products currently include 35inch form factor drives with capacities ranging from 8 gigabytes “gb” to 250 gb nominal rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” serial advanced technology attachment “sata” 1394 firewire ilink tm and universal serial bus “usb” the company sells its products worldwide to computer manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems or subsystems to ce manufacturers for inclusion into their devices and to distributors resellers and retailers the company’s hard disk drive products are currently manufactured in malaysia and thailand for geographical financial data see the company’s consolidated financial statements and note 9 thereto included in this annual report on form 10k in this annual report on form 10k the company refers to market data available from trendfocus inc “trendfocus” and gartner dataquest inc “gartner” both of which are leading market research and analysis firms that provide data regarding the hard disk drive industry industry   western digital’s primary business focus is the sale of hard disk drives to the desktop pc enterprise and ce markets   desktop pc market   desktop pcs are used in a number of environments ranging from homes to businesses and multiuser networks software applications are used on desktop pcs for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and other related applications hard disk drives store both software applications and the data used by these software applications the company believes that the demand for hard disk drives in the pc market has grown in part due to    trendfocus estimates that the aggregate number of desktop pcs sold during calendar year 2003 was 115 million units and will increase to 152 million units in calendar year 2008 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7 the company believes the rate of pc unit growth is being influenced by several factors including maturing markets in north america and western europe an increase in firsttime buyers in eastern europe and asia the lengthening of pc replacement cycles and an increasing preference for notebook systems for an additional discussion of changes in the pc market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   according to trendfocus quarterly reports for 2004 and calendar year 2003 the desktop pc segment is the largest market for hard disk drives accounting for approximately 65 of global hard disk drive shipments in 2004 approximately 90 of western digital’s hard disk drive unit shipments in 2004 were to this market trendfocus estimates that worldwide unit shipments of hard disk drives into this market will grow from approximately 178 million units in calendar year 2003 to approximately 232 million units in calendar year 2007 and that revenue will grow from 3 approximately 12 billion to approximately 14 billion during this period this reflects compound annual growth rates for unit shipments and revenues of approximately 7 and 4 respectively revenue growth is expected to be lower than unit growth due to the ongoing trend for lower cost pcs and competition within the industry although the average selling prices “asps” of hard disk drives are expected to continue to decline the demand for overall product quality and reliability continues to increase 

  most new desktop pc systems are equipped with highspeed external interfaces such as 1394 firewire ilink or usb as a result end users are able to supplement the storage space of their pc systems with the use of external hard disk drive products that connect via these highspeed interfaces these products are commonly used for storing additional programs or multimedia content or for backing up internal hard disk drives   mobile computing market   the mobile computing market which includes notebook computers is expected to grow faster than any other pc segment as performance and price continue to improve trendfocus estimates that sales of notebook systems comprised approximately 28 of the combined market for desktop pcs and notebook systems in 2003 and will increase to approximately 39 of the combined market in 2008 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 22 western digital did not ship any hard disk drives to the mobile pc market during 2004 however the company has announced intentions to enter the mobile pc market with new 25inch form factor product offerings before the end of calendar year 2004   enterprise market   the enterprise market for hard disk drives focuses on customers that make workstations servers network attached storage devices storage area networks and other computing systems or subsystems this market has been traditionally served by hard disk drives that use the smallcomputersystemsinterface “scsi” standard recently however scsi hard disk drives are being replaced by sata and eide hard disk drives in certain enterprise storage applications sata is an interface technology supported by industry standards sata hard disk drives cost less than scsi but offer improved reliability scalability and performance over eide hard disk drives in enterprise environments trendfocus estimates that in calendar year 2004 approximately 30 of the enterprise hard disk drive market will utilize eide or sata hard disk drives and that this percentage will increase to 43 by 2007   one example of growth in the enterprise market is “nearline” storage during the past few years a new diskbased backup market has emerged with highcapacity eide hard disk drives augmenting scsi tape and optical media this new trend popularly referred to as “nearline” storage has become a growth market due to the ability of hard disk drives to backup or access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions and to quickly retrieve critical backup or nearline data the increasing use of hard disk drives in nearline storage applications is also being enhanced by the availability of eide hard disk drive solutions which are more cost competitive as compared to scsi hard disk drives   in addition eide drives are also being used in unique clustering applications for databases scientific computation web caching and electronic mail this segment has become a significant market for large capacity eide hard disk drives and the company believes that this segment will continue to consume a significant and growing portion of the company’s highest capacity hard disk drives   according to a may 2004 report published by trendfocus the market for enterprise and other nondesktop pc applications of 35inch form factor hard disk drives is forecasted to grow from approximately 33 million units in calendar year 2003 to approximately 83 million units in calendar year 2007 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 26 for an additional discussion of the nondesktop pc hard disk drive market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   consumer electronics market   since 1999 hard disk drivebased recorders of audio and video content have been available for use in home entertainment systems commonly called personal video recorders “pvrs” or digital video recorders “dvrs” these consumer devices offer the enduser enhanced features such as pausing live television simplifying the process of recording and cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or rewinding to any section of a recorded television program in addition hard disk drives are being increasingly incorporated into dvd recorders to allow for pvrdvr functionality and faster recording of content onto removable dvds new devices are being developed that generate store 4 and play audio video graphic images and other multimedia content gartner forecasts that unit shipments of hard disk drives into the audiovideo market will grow from approximately 10 million units in calendar year 2003 to approximately 58 million units in calendar year 2008 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 42 for further discussion of the audiovideo market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

  another segment of the ce market is the inclusion of hard disk drives in electronic game devices according to trendfocus home electronic game devices that include hard disk drives had sales of approximately 10 million units in calendar year 2003 with an expected compound annual growth rate of approximately 14 through calendar year 2008 for an additional discussion of the video game market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   other market opportunities   the company continuously evaluates opportunities to apply its knowledge of data storage technology beyond current markets for hard disk drives new business opportunities are evaluated for their direct impact on the company’s ability to increase the sale of hard disk drives the company monitors the development of new markets related to data or content storage and may from time to time offer new products or services to address appropriate new form factors interfaces or markets conversely depending on the development of such markets and the company’s ability to achieve its goals the company may from time to time withdraw from certain markets products   the company offers a broad line of hard disk drives designed for various market segments western digital’s products are marketed under the wd caviar® wd protégé® and wd raptor® brand names and each product line is designed for a particular market segment the company’s wd caviar and wd protégé hard disk drive products are designed to serve distinct portions of the desktop pc market wd caviar hard disk drives are designed for the advanced performance segment of the desktop pc market and the server and external storage markets and wd protégé hard disk drives are designed for the value segment of the desktop pc market entry level pcs and the game console market the wd raptor hard disk drive is a sata drive designed for the enterprise storage market and highend desktop pc applications   desktop pc hard disk drive products the wd caviar and wd protégé hard disk drive families currently consist of 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 8 gb to 250 gb and nominal rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 rpm these products utilize either the eide or sata interfaces providing high performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection the type of eide interface currently used in a majority of the company’s hard disk drives is ata100 which signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second the sata interface available in certain of the company’s wd caviar special edition tm hard disk drives enable transfer rates as high as 150 megabytes per second the company also sells a line of external hard disk drives and related adapters that are designed to accommodate external storage interfaces including 1394 firewireilink and usb the 1394 firewire ilink interface is a highspeed interface that can be used to add additional external portable storage capacity to desktop and laptop computers   mobile hard disk drive products hard disk drives used in mobile products typically include 25 18 or 10inch form factor drives although the desktop pc market accounts for a majority of hard disk drive sales unit shipments of hard disk drives for the mobile market are increasing trendfocus forecasts that unit sales of hard disk drives to the mobile market will grow from approximately 50 million in calendar year 2003 to approximately 128 million in calendar year 2007 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 26 the company has announced intentions to enter the 25inch mobile market before the end of calendar year 2004 in addition the company has indicated its plans to develop and bring to market smaller form factor drives   enterprise hard disk drive products western digital currently offers multiple products to address enterprise market needs including the wd raptor hard disk drive a 10000 rpm enterpriseclass drive with the sata interface and the wd caviar raid edition hard disk drive a 7200 rpm drive manufactured to enterpriseclass standards and equipped with either sata or eide interfaces for primary storage such as engineering data management document and image management scientific computing video surveillance web server file server and near line storage 5   hard disk drive products for servers and external storage western digital’s products for server and external storage such as network attached storage disk arrays “nas” and storage area network disk arrays “san” currently consist of 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 367 gb to 250 gb and nominal rotation speeds of 7200 and 10000 rpm the company’s server and external storage products include the wd raptor hard disk drive equipped with the sata interface and the wd caviar raid edition hard disk drive equipped with either the sata or eide interface   consumer electronics products the company offers design capabilities and hard disk drive technologies for consumer applications the company currently offers hard disk drive products designed for use in consumer audiovideo applications such as pvrs and dvrs it also offers products for the video game console market and provides hard disk drives for other consumer electronics products technology and product development   hard disk drives are used to record store and retrieve digital data their performance attributes are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical hard disk drives and tapes and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard disk drive performance include    all of the company’s hard disk drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard disk drive are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board the head disk assembly includes the head media disks head positioning mechanism actuator and spin motor these components are contained in a hard base plate protective package in a contaminationcontrolled environment the printed circuit board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector   the head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spin motor disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk   the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks that are divided into sectors the computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved   industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the hard disk drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interface for desktop pcs is eide and the primary interface for enterprise systems is scsi as computer performance continues to improve the hard disk drive will need to deliver information faster than these interfaces can handle the company believes that the desktop pc industry plans to transition to higher speed interfaces such as sata to handle the higher data transfer rates the company currently offers its wd caviar special edition sata hard disk 6 drive a 7200 rpm drive featuring capacities as large as 250 gb and designed for the highend pc workstation server and external storage markets the company believes that sata is also becoming a more popular interface in the enterprise market western digital currently offers its wd raptor hard disk drive a 10000 rpm enterpriseclass drive with the sata interface and the wd caviar raid edition hard disk drive a 7200 rpm drive manufactured to enterpriseclass standards and available with a sata interface the company is working to develop additional products that will support these higher speed interfaces 

  storage capacity of the hard disk drive as manufactured by western digital is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter as the areal density increases fewer disks andor heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity thus reducing product costs through reduced component requirements   head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density historically there have been rapid technological changes resulting in several generations of head technology in a relatively short period of time however in recent years the time has lengthened between changes in generations of head technology currently the desktop hard disk drive industry uses giant magnetoresistive head technology which allows significantly higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thinfilm head technology all of the company’s hard disk drive product offerings currently employ giant magnetoresistive head technology   the western digital product line generally leverages a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve the differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows the company to achieve lower costs through economies of scale purchasing this platform strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models the company expects to continue to utilize this platform strategy as it continues to develop products for the emerging market for hard disk drives specifically designed for audiovideo applications such as digital video recording devices   constant innovations in research and development are essential to the company’s ability to compete hard disk drive providers including western digital are evaluating or implementing a number of technological innovations designed to further increase hard disk drive performance and reduce product costs   for an additional discussion of technological innovations see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” sales and distribution   the company sells its products globally to system manufacturers distributors resellers systems integrators and retailers manufacturers typically purchase components such as hard disk drives and assemble them into the computer systems they build distributors typically sell the company’s drives to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers   original equipment manufacturers “oems” sales to oems accounted for 51 52 and 54 of the company’s revenue in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively during 2004 the company’s major oem customers included dell fujitsu gateway including sales to emachines prior to its acquisition by gateway in march 2004 hewlettpackard and ibm typically revenue from sales to certain oems account for more than 10 of the company’s revenue for example during 2004 sales to dell accounted for 14 of the company’s revenue during 2003 sales to dell and hewlettpackard including sales to compaq computer after its merger with hewlettpackard in 2002 accounted for 20 and 13 of revenue respectively during 2002 sales to dell and hewlettpackard including sales to compaq computer prior to its merger with hewlettpackard in 2002 accounted for 15 and 13 of revenue respectively the company believes that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve its strong relationships with the leading computer manufacturers since 2000 seagate technology western digital and maxtor which merged with quantum in 2000 have had the highest market share with these manufacturers   system manufacturers evaluate and select their hard disk drive suppliers based on a number of factors including overall quality and reliability storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing 7 business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability they typically seek to qualify two or more providers for each generation of hard disk drives and once a computer manufacturer has chosen its qualified hard disk drive vendors for a given product it generally will purchase hard disk drives from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with system manufacturers’ qualifications a hard disk drive supplier must consistently offer hard disk drives featuring leading technology quality reliability and acceptable capacity per disk suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of high quality and reliable hard disk drives to quickly achieve high volume production a hard disk drive supplier must have access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities 

  many of the company’s oem customers utilize justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” computer manufacturer does not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” computer manufacturer contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the computer manufacturer’s instructions for certain key oems the company maintains a base stock of finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent to the oem’s operations   for an additional discussion of the need to adapt to customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   distributors the company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products to small computer manufacturers resellers dealers and systems integrators during 2004 the company’s major distributor customers included asi bell esys distribution ingram micro and tech data distributors accounted for approximately 42 40 and 39 of the company’s revenue for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with the company for purchase and redistribution of product the company grants its distributors limited price protection and stock rotation rights   retailers the company sells its retailpackaged products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores and authorizes sales through distributors to smaller retailers during 2004 major retailers to whom the company sold directly included best buy circuit city comp usa fry’s electronics and officemax retailers accounted for approximately 7 8 and 7 of the company’s revenue for each of 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the company’s current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe the retail channel complements the company’s other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for the company and its products retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade” and data backup sectors in which endusers purchase and install products to upgrade their computers and externally store their data for backup purposes the company grants certain of its retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis the company also sells its retailpackaged products through the internet at its web site   the company maintains sales offices throughout north america eastern and western europe the middle east japan and asia pacific field application engineering is provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts and localized enduser technical support services are provided within the united states canada europe and asia the company’s localized enduser technical support is currently supplied by employees and a third party provider through telephone support and via the company’s web site   the company’s international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 63 59 and 50 of the company’s revenue for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs various trade regulations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and significant customer information see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements   the company’s marketing and advertising functions are performed both internally and through outside firms advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials are targeted to various reseller and enduser segments western digital utilizes both consumer media and to a lesser extent trade publications the company has programs under which qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain marketing expenditures western digital also maintains customer relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing endusers with presale and postsale information and support through its web site 8 competition   the company competes primarily with manufacturers of 35inch hard disk drives for desktop enterprise and ce systems the company’s competitors in the hard disk drive market include seagate technology maxtor fujitsu hitachi global storage technologies and samsung over the last four years the hard disk drive industry has experienced consolidation decreasing the number of major competitors in particular maxtor acquired the hard disk drive business of quantum fujitsu exited the desktop hard disk drive market and ibm sold its hard disk drive business to hitachi global storage technologies   the hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive with hard disk drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard disk drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard disk drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies between different customer and market segments the company believes that it is generally competitive in all of these factors   the company believes that the markets in which it competes and those in which it plans to enter in the near future such as the mobile market are at or approaching high volume mass market where market acceptance and consumer demand for products are strong this represents a significant change in the industry in prior years the mobile handheld and enterprise markets were relatively small with low volumes and high prices as these markets continue to grow consumers will demand lower cost points for the products that utilize these drives as a result it will be necessary for suppliers to offer high quality reliable products at low cost to be able to effectively compete the company believes that its model enables it to deliver products with superior quality and reliability at a low cost   the company believes that there are no substantial barriers for existing competitors to offer competing products therefore the company believes that it cannot differentiate its hard disk drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly the company differentiates itself by focusing on high product quality and reliability and designing and incorporating into its hard disk drives desirable product performance attributes such as seek time data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics and data recovery in addition the company emphasizes nonproduct related attributes including rapid response with its customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction the company also relies on the strength of the western digital brand name with valueadded resellers and solution providers to whom the company sells its hard disk drive products directly and indirectly the company believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard disk drive particularly within such a rapidly changing technology environment   advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than the company’s hard disk drive products highspeed semiconductor memory could compete with the company’s hard disk drive products in the future semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic hard disk drives but currently is not competitive from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance than hard disk drives it has lower “write” performance flash memory could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard disk drives   for an additional discussion of competition see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” service and warranty   western digital generally warrants its newly manufactured hard disk drives against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one to five years from the date of sale the company’s warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the hard disk drive the company has engaged third parties in australia brazil canada china germany hungary india korea russia singapore and the united arab emirates to provide various levels of testing processing andor recertification of returned hard disk drives for the company’s customers in addition the company processes tests and recertifies returned hard disk drives at its own facility in the united states 9 manufacturing   to be competitive western digital must manufacture high quality hard disk drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs the company strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility and high manufacturing yields while insisting that its suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of western digital’s hard disk drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key vendor relationships by establishing partner relationships with its strategic component suppliers the company believes it is able to access “bestofclass” manufacturing quality in addition the company believes that its sourcing strategy currently enables it to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve   hard disk drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and thorough testing the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment that demands skill in process engineering and efficient utilization of the “clean room” layout in order to reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing environment the company’s clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells   the company produces hard disk drives in two plants one in malaysia and one in thailand the company continually evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs for example in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company closed two manufacturing facilities in singapore during 1999 and 2000 and relocated its hard disk drive production to malaysia during 2002 in response to an increase in demand and in order to capitalize on the local supplier base the company completed the acquisition of a thailand manufacturing facility the company continually evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs   in july 2003 the company purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite corporation formerly one of the company’s suppliers of heads including its wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and its slider fabrication facility in bang pain thailand the company uses these facilities to design and manufacture a substantial portion of the head gimbal assemblies “hgas” and head stack assemblies “hsas” for use in hard disk drives it manufactures   for an additional discussion of manufacturing see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” research and development   the company devotes substantial resources to development of new products and improvement of existing products the company focuses its engineering efforts on coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in order to bring its products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses for continuing operations totaled 201 million 135 million and 120 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively   for further discussion of product development see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” materials and supplies   the principal components currently used in the manufacture of the company’s hard disk drives are magnetic heads and related hsas media controllers spindle motors and mechanical parts used in the head disk assembly in addition to custom semiconductor devices the company also uses standard semiconductor components such as logic memory and microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a wide variety of other parts including connectors cables and other interconnect technology   the company designs and manufactures a substantial portion of the heads required for the hard disk drives it manufactures the company also purchases a portion of these components from third party suppliers during 2004 the company bought giant magnetoresistive heads from alps electric co ltd and tdk corporation’s subsidiary sae magnetics ltd 10   the company acquires all of the remaining components for its products from third party suppliers the company tries to have multiple suppliers for each of its component requirements for example during 2004 the company’s media requirements were purchased from several outside vendors including komag showa denko kk and trace storage technology corporation the company has a volume purchase agreement with komag under which the company is obligated to purchase a percentage of its requirements for hard disk media from komag as long as komag’s prices technology and quality remain competitive   although the company tries to have multiple suppliers for each of its component requirements some components are currently solesourced for example some custom integrated circuit devices are currently solesourced from stmicroelectronics ibm and marvell semiconductor inc the company has entered into volume purchase agreements with ibm and marvell to purchase custom integrated circuit devices at negotiated quantities and prices because of their custom nature these products require significant designin periods and long lead times there has been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased integration of various separate circuits the company expects this trend to continue in the area of custom integrated circuits for hard disk drives   for an additional discussion of component supplies see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” backlog   historically a substantial portion of the company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order the company generally negotiates pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to the company with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition many of the company’s sales to oems are made under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead the company receives a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and the customer is invoiced upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the company’s revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods patents licenses and proprietary information   the company owns numerous patents and has many patent applications in process the company believes that although its patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of its products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of its personnel accordingly the patents held and applied for do not assure the company’s future success   in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights the company considers elements of its product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential the company believes that its nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of its process technology is an important factor in its success western digital relies upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect its proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the company conducts business also may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states   the company relies on certain technology that is licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its products the company believes that it has adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to its own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard disk drive industry   for additional discussion of intellectual property see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” environmental regulation   the company is subject to a variety of regulations in connection with its operations it believes that it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for its operations 11 employees   as of july 2 2004 the company employed a total of 17376 employees worldwide this represents an increase in headcount of approximately 51 since june 27 2003 and an increase of approximately 82 since june 28 2002 the increase is primarily the result of the company’s acquisition of readrite’s assets in july 2003 and the purchase of a manufacturing facility in thailand during 2002 in response to an increase in unit sales   many of the company’s employees are highly skilled and the company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly the company offers employee benefit programs which it believes are at least equivalent to those offered by its competitors despite these programs the company has along with most of its competitors experienced difficulty at times in hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel when the company is unable to hire personnel in the ordinary course of business it uses third parties to help satisfy its personnel needs in addition the company has utilized consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited the company has never experienced a work stoppage none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor organization and the company considers its employee relations to be good available information

  unless otherwise indicated references herein to specific years and quarters are to the company’s fiscal years and fiscal quarters business overview   western digital designs develops manufactures and markets hard disk drives for digital information storage the company’s hard disk drives are used in desktop pcs enterprise servers network attached storage devices an expanding list of ce products such as video game consoles personaldigital video recorders and satellite and cable settop boxes and as external storage devices western digital markets its hard disk drives directly to pc manufacturers including large brand name pc manufacturers such as dell and hewlett packard to ce manufacturers and to distributors resellers and retailers that serve a wide range of end users unless otherwise noted all references to market share and industry data included in this discussion are according to the gartner report published in april of 2004   western digital builds hard disk drives in assembly facilities in malaysia and thailand the company also builds hard disk drive components such as printed circuit board assemblies and head stack assemblies in its malaysia and thailand facilities in july 2003 the company acquired head manufacturing facilities in california and thailand and currently produces a significant portion of its head requirements western digital procures other components from industryleading technology companies many of which work with the company from design and development through manufacturing   currently eight hard disk drive vendors compete in the 22 billionayear hard disk drive market compared to fifteen vendors in calendar year 2000 according to gartner quarterly reports published in 2004 and calendar year 2003 western digital seagate technology maxtor corporation and hitachi global storage technologies supplied approximately 80 of the total hard disk drive market during 2004   the company focuses on providing quality products superior customer service and flexibility by managing its technology deployment manufacturing cost delivery quality and reliability western digital believes that its low cost business model allows it to access leadingedge component technologies and costsaving innovations while minimizing investment expenditures   western digital’s growth will be influenced greatly by developments in the pc hard disk drive market gartner estimates that unit shipments of hard disk drives in the desktop pc market will grow by approximately 4 per year through calendar year 2008 the company has increased its resources to address certain fastgrowing geographic markets such as asia latin america eastern europe and russia the company’s revenue in asia during 2004 increased to 29 of total revenue as compared to 22 of total revenue for 2003 gartner estimates that demand for desktop pc hard disk drives in asia will increase 12 per year through calendar year 2008   because ce demand for hard disk drives is relatively new with many consumer applications currently employing similar hard disk drive technology as is found in desktop pcs western digital presently believes it can expand shipments into this developing market as this market develops additional investments by the company may be required gartner estimates that unit shipments of 35inch form factor hard disk drives in ce markets will grow by approximately 26 per year through calendar year 2008   the company is also pursuing new revenue opportunities in nonpc information technology “it” applications through its application of the sata interface the sata interface contains many of the same benefits of scsi — the predominant interface currently used in most enterprise hard disk drive applications — at a lower cost trendfocus estimates that 43 of enterprise hard disk drive unit shipments will use the eide or sata interface by calendar year 2007   in addition to the ce and sata growth opportunities the company has plans to enter the mobile hard disk drive market in calendar year 2004 to provide hard disk drives for notebook pcs gartner forecasts that unit sales of 25inch form factor hard disk drives to the mobile computing market will grow from an estimated 47 million in calendar year 2003 to approximately 97 million in calendar year 2008 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15 16 fiscal 2004 overview   according to quarterly reports for 2004 and calendar year 2003 from gartner the desktop hard disk drive market increased by approximately 17 based on unit shipments based on quarterly reports published by gartner in 2004 and calendar 2003 the company believes that its market share in desktop hard disk drives increased to 24 from 23 in 2003 while western digital’s unit shipments grew by 22 in 2004 the average selling price of its hard disk drives declined by 8 due to aggressive pricing pressures and mix of products   in 2004 western digital’s net revenue increased by 12 to 30 billion on unit shipments of 483 million however in 2004 gross margin decreased to 152 from 163 in 2003 primarily as a result of aggressive pricing pressures in addition the company incurred approximately 50 million of startup expenses and other charges related to the acquisition of substantially all the assets of readrite corporation “readrite” in july 2003 these factors offset the ongoing positive contribution of the company’s newly acquired head manufacturing operations as a result operating income decreased by 319 million to 1549 million and operating margins decreased to 51 as a percentage of net revenue compared with 69 in 2003 for 2005 the company expects incremental benefits from its integrated head operations however it is not clear whether this will be enough to offset any continued downward pressure on gross margin caused by competitive pricing western digital generated 1900 million in cash flow from operations in 2004 and finished the year with 3778 million in cash and cash equivalents a decrease of 154 million from the prior year’s balance read rite asset acquisition   in june 2003 readrite then one of the company’s suppliers of magnetic recording heads commenced voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings on july 31 2003 western digital purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite including its wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and manufacturing facility in bang pain thailand the cost of the acquisition was 1720 million and consisted of cash consideration of 948 million assumed debt obligations of the thailand operations of approximately 602 million direct costs of the acquisition and other miscellaneous assumed obligations totaling 170 million proceeds from a 50 million term loan were used to repay obligations assumed as a result of the acquired head manufacturing operations in thailand   western digital’s acquisition of the head manufacturing operations represented a fundamental change in the company’s operating structure as the company is now manufacturing heads for use in its hard disk drives previously the company purchased all of its recording head requirements from external suppliers including readrite the company acquired the readrite assets for the following reasons    taking the asset acquisition into consideration the company expects its longterm financial business model to benefit from a higher gross margin percentage offset by higher research and development expenses than it otherwise would have had without the acquisition the gross margin percentage improvement will result from lower cost of sales as the company develops the ability to manufacture heads at a lower cost than what it would have otherwise paid external suppliers this is expected to result in higher operating income than it otherwise would have had without the acquisition   the company began realizing these net financial benefits in 2004 however these benefits were offset by downward pressures on gross margins caused by an aggressive pricing environment the incremental benefits from an integrated head manufacturing operation are expected to increase as the company continues to ramp its head manufacturing capability the company is currently satisfying a substantial portion of its head requirements through its own head manufacturing operations   as a result of integrating the head manufacturing operations the company carries a higher percentage of fixed costs than assumed in its prior financial business model for example depreciation expense for the head manufacturing operations is expected to be between 15 million and 20 million per quarter by the end of 2005 17   capital expenditures and working capital investments required to support the head manufacturing operations will increase when compared to the company’s prior financial business model for example capital expenditures related to the head manufacturing operations are expected to average between 80 million and 100 million on an annual basis after initial capital investments are completed also inventory turns are expected to decrease to between 17 and 19 from the company’s historical average of between 20 and 22   the company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows    as of the date of the acquisition readrite had two inprocess research and development “iprd” projects 120 gigabyte per platter and 160 gigabyte per platter products the fair value allocated to these projects as part of the acquisition was 178 million and 78 million respectively the multiperiod excess earnings method a discounted cash flow income approach was used to determine the value allocated to the iprd the rate utilized to discount the cash flows to their present values was based on the weighted average cost of capital and an additional risk premium based on an analysis of the technology and the iprd stages of completion based on these factors 27 was used as the annual discount rate these acquired iprd projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use accordingly the company recorded the 256 million as a charge to research and development expense at the time of the acquisition results of operations 

 

   the following table sets forth for the periods indicated summary information from the company’s statements of income in millions  net revenue   net revenue was 30 billion for 2004 an increase of 12 or 328 million from 2003 total unit shipments increased to 483 million for the year as compared to 397 million from the prior year as a result of an increase in market share and overall demand for hard disk drives in the desktop pc market this growth in units was partially offset by a 5 per unit decline in average selling prices “asps” to 63 per unit for 2004 from 68 per unit in 2003   revenue by geographic region for 2004 was 41 from the americas 30 from europe and 29 from asia compared to 48 30 and 22 respectively for 2003 these changes reflect the company’s continued focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic markets 18   revenue by sales channel for 2004 was 51 from oems 42 from distributors and 7 from the retail channel compared to 52 40 and 8 respectively for 2003 the distribution of revenue by sales channel has remained relatively consistent for the past several quarters   net revenue increased 567 million or 26 in 2003 from 2002 this increase in net revenue was primarily due to the company’s improved market share as well as an increase in demand for hard disk drives in the pc market unit shipments increased to 397 million in 2003 from 291 million in 2002 partially offset by a decrease in asps to 68 per unit in 2003 from 74 per unit in 2002 

 

   for 2004 gross margin percentage decreased to 152 from 163 for 2003 the decrease in gross margin percentage over the prior year was primarily the result of aggressive pricing pressures the company anticipates that competitive pricing pressure may continue to adversely affect gross margin percentages in 2005 also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage were startup expenses and other charges totaling 181 million incurred during the first quarter of 2004 relating to the company’s head manufacturing operations acquired in july 2003 western digital was able to partially offset the impact of these pricing conditions and startup related costs with the ongoing accretive benefit of its head manufacturing operations for 2003 gross margin percentage increased to 163 from 131 for 2002 this increase in gross margin percentage was primarily a result of a more moderate pricing environment manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher unit volume and continuing cost reduction efforts offset by an 185 million charge related to the cirrus logic inc litigation settlement 

 

   total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” were 101 of net revenue in 2004 as compared to 94 of net revenue in 2003 and 107 of net revenue in 2002   rd expense was 201 million 135 million and 120 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase of 66 million in rd expense in 2004 from 2003 was primarily related to headdesign mobile and enterprise platform development as well as the charge of 26 million incurred during the first quarter of 2004 for acquired iprd offset by reduced employee incentive payments the 26 million charge related to iprd projects acquired from readrite that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of july 2 2004 progress on these projects was consistent with management’s original estimates including the costs incurred towards completion and projected release dates the increase of 15 million in rd in 2003 over 2002 was due to increases in new development programs and higher employee incentive payments partially offset by expense reduction efforts   sga expense was 106 million 121 million and 111 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the 15 million decrease in sga expense in 2004 from 2003 was primarily due to a reduction in employee incentive programs and reductions in baseline spending the 10 million increase in sga expense in 2003 from 2002 was primarily related to higher incentive payments resulting from improved operational results   the company will continue to manage its operating expense structure in line with its operating profit objectives 

 

   net interest and other income was 03 million 29 million and 14 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively this includes net investment gains of 44 million in 2003 and 54 million in 2002 excluding these items net interest and other income expense was 03 million 15 million and 40 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in net interest income over the past two years was primarily due to the company’s redemption of its convertible debentures during the third quarter of 2003 resulting in lower interest expense as compared to 2002 

 

   income tax expense was 39 million in 2004 as compared to 76 million in 2003 and an income tax benefit of 11 million in 2002 the decrease in the income tax expense of 37 million in 2004 primarily related to lower overall 19 earnings and a more favorable mix of earnings within certain tax jurisdictions differences between the effective tax rate for 2004 of 25 as compared to the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia and thailand that expire at various points in time ranging from 2005 to 2014 the 2003 increase in the income tax expense of 87 million from 2002 is primarily related to higher overall earnings in 2003 and the nonrecurrence of certain tax benefits realized in 2002 the company’s 2002 net income tax benefit of 11 million included a federal income tax refund of 31 million for a loss carryback available as a result of tax legislation enacted during that year 

 

   during 2002 the company discontinued the operations of new business ventures including connex inc “connex” sanavigator inc “sanavigator” and keen personal media inc “keen” the company sold substantially all of the assets of its connex and sanavigator businesses in 2002 for a net gain of 245 million and terminated the keen operations the 2002 operating losses for the new ventures and the net gain recognized on the sale of connex and sanavigator have been excluded from continuing operations and reported separately on the statements of income as discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources   the company had cash and cash equivalents of 378 million at july 2 2004 and 393 million at june 27 2003 net cash provided by operating activities during 2004 was 190 million as compared to 278 million for 2003 net cash flows from operating activities primarily resulted from net income this represents the company’s principal source of cash operating cash flows were impacted by net cash used to fund working capital requirements of 89 million for 2004 an increase of 116 million from 2003 the increase in net cash used to fund working capital requirements was primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance associated with changes in the company’s mix of customers higher work in process inventory associated with the head manufacturing operations and the payment of a 45 million litigation settlement   the company’s working capital requirements depend upon the effective management of the company’s cash conversion cycle the cash conversion cycle which consisted of 39 days sales outstanding “dso” plus 20 days inventory outstanding “dio” less 61 days payable outstanding “dpo” was negative two days for 2004 as compared to negative nine days for 2003 the increase in the cash conversion cycle was due to higher dso’s as a result of changes in the company’s mix of customers and higher dio’s as a result of the longer production cycle associated with the head manufacturing operations these increases were partially offset by an increase in dpo’s the company expects its financial business model will continue to generate a negative cash conversion cycle going forward   net cash used in investing activities for 2004 was 227 million as compared to 59 million for 2003 the 2004 investing activities consisted of 95 million for the readrite asset acquisition and 132 million of net capital expenditures the 2003 investing activities related primarily to net capital expenditures the increase in net capital expenditures was primarily for assets purchased to upgrade the company’s head manufacturing capabilities increase desktop hard disk drive production capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets for 2005 capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately 250 million the increase in capital expenditures is expected to consist primarily of investments in mobile hard disk drive manufacturing capacity continued expansion of head manufacturing operations and it infrastructure upgrades the company expects to use planned capital lease facilities to offset up to 100 million of its capital expenditures approximately 19 million of capital leases were completed in 2004   net cash provided by financing activities for 2004 was 21 million as compared to net cash used by financing activities of 50 million for 2003 the net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 consisted primarily of 24 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans and 14 million of net proceeds from longterm debt partially offset by 16 million used in the company’s stock repurchase program the net cash used by financing activities for the year ended 2003 consisted primarily of 88 million used for redemption of the company’s remaining convertible debentures partially offset by 44 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans 20 capital commitments   the following is a summary of the company’s significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at july 2 2004 in millions  

 

   on september 19 2003 the company entered into a new 125 million fiveyear credit facility “senior credit facility” replacing the facility that matured on september 20 2003 the new senior credit facility provides up to 75 million subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation in revolving credit and a term loan of 50 million both the term loan and revolving credit facility mature on september 19 2008 and are secured by the company’s accounts receivable inventory 65 of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets at the option of the company borrowings bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin the senior credit facility requires the company to maintain certain levels of income prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number of other covenants the company was in compliance with all such covenants at july 2 2004 the 50 million term loan was funded on september 22 2003 and requires quarterly principal payments of 3 million beginning in october 2004 the company used the proceeds from the term loan to repay obligations incurred as a result of the readrite asset acquisition see note 3 “readrite asset acquisition” included in the company’s consolidated financial statements at july 2 2004 there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and 71 million was available 

 

   in the normal course of business to reduce the risk of component shortages the company enters into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard disk drive components used to manufacture the company’s products these purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter become payable upon receipt of the components and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components in some cases we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to or cancellation of a purchase order such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process the company has entered into longterm purchase agreements for components with certain vendors such as komag ibm and marvell future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on the company’s overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices technology and quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive these arrangements are not included under “purchase obligations” in the table above see below under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” for a discussion of these commitments 

 

   the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies see part ii item 7a under the heading “disclosure about foreign currency risk” for the company’s current forward exchange contract commitments 

 

   the company announced a stock repurchase program on may 5 2004 under the program the company may purchase on the open market up to 100 million of its common stock depending on market conditions and other 21 corporate considerations stock repurchases are expected to be funded by operating cash flow some of the repurchased shares will offset the dilutive impact of common stock issued under employee stock option and share purchase programs during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company repurchased 19 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately 160 million during 2005 the company may continue to opportunistically repurchase its stock as market conditions allow for example during august 2004 the company repurchased an additional 21 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 150 million 

  the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that the senior credit facility or lease financing will continue to be available to the company also the company’s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” the company currently anticipates that it will continue to utilize its liquidity and cash flows to improve the efficiency and capability of its existing hard disk drive and head manufacturing operations critical accounting policies   the company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities the company has adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve management’s judgment and estimates if these estimates differ significantly from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 

 

   in accordance with standard industry practice the company has agreements with resellers that provide price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions in addition the company may have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation on slowmoving items and other incentive programs in accordance with current accounting standards the company recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers adjustments are based on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers as well as historical pricing information if endmarket demand for hard disk drives declines significantly the company may have to increase sellthrough incentive payments to resellers resulting in an increase in price protection allowances which could adversely impact operating results   the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition the company routinely analyzes the different receivable aging categories and its bad debt loss history and establishes reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due an increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could negatively affect operating results   the company records provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized the company bases these provisions on existing product return notifications as well as historical returns by product type see “warranty” if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return provision would be required which could negatively affect operating results 

 

   the company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized warranty covers costs of repair or replacement of the hard disk drive over the warranty period which generally ranges from one to five years the company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty which include specific detail on hard disk drives in the field by product type historical field return rates and costs to repair if actual product return rates or costs to repair returned products increase above expectations an increase in the warranty provision would be required which could negatively affect operating results 22 

 

   inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value inventory writedowns are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances   the company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information and writes down inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of the company’s products which may require an increase in inventory writedowns that could negatively affect operating results 

 

   the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies accordingly the company accrues loss contingencies when management in consultation with its legal advisors concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable refer to part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 “legal proceedings” included in this annual report on form 10k the ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments estimates and inherent uncertainties the actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management’s estimates 

 

   the company’s deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are fully reserved due to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized this determination is based on the weight of available evidence the most significant of which is the company’s loss history in the related tax jurisdictions should this determination change in the future some amount of deferred tax assets could be recognized resulting in a tax benefit or a reduction of future tax expense risk factors that may affect future results 

 

   the hard disk drive industry has experienced declining asp’s although the rate of decline has moderated in recent years there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in fact during the fourth quarter of 2004 asps decreased significantly increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore a lower component cost because of the competitiveness of the hard disk drive industry lower costs generally mean lower prices this is true even for those products that are competitive and introduced into the market in a timely manner our asps decline even further when competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share 

 

   to achieve consistent success with our customers who manufacturer computers systems and consumer electronic devices we must balance several key attributes timetomarket timetovolume quality cost service price and a broad product portfolio if we fail to  23  our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

   new products in the desktop hard disk drive market may require higher areal densities than previous product generations posing formidable technical and manufacturing challenges higher areal densities require existing head technology to be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on a single disk in addition our introduction of new products during a technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns our failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results in addition technology improvements may require us to reduce the price on existing products to remain competitive 

 

   the rate of increase in areal density may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity this could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with more lowercost singlesurface drives thereby decreasing our revenue as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity our asps could decline which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

   product life cycles have been extending since the middle of calendar year 2002 due in large part to a decrease in the rate of hard disk drive areal density growth however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue if longer product life cycles continue we may need to develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any particular product in order to maintain competitive pricing for such product this may result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results if product life cycles shorten it may be more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete although we believe that the current rate of growth in areal density is lower than in the past several years and will continue to decrease in the near term we expect that areal density will continue to increase our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers to be considered for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with our new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume computer manufacturers most of which continue to consolidate their share of the pc market if product life cycles continue to be extended due to a decrease in the rate of areal density growth we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could harm our competitive position these risks are increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current generation products 

 

   if one of our competitors were able to implement a significant advance in head or hard disk drive technology that enables a “stepchange” increase in areal density that permits greater storage of data on a disk it could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our operating results 24   advances in magnetic optical semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products if these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity we could be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those products 

 

   currently the hard disk drive industry uses giant magnetoresistive head technology which allows significantly higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thinfilm head technology however the industry is developing new recording technologies that may enable greater recording densities than currently available using magnetoresistive head technology including perpendicular current perpendiculartoplane and tunneling junction technology if the industry experiences a fundamental shift in recording technology hard disk drive manufacturers would need to timely adjust their designs and processes to accommodate the new technology in order to remain competitive as a result we could incur substantial costs in developing new technologies media and tools to remain competitive we may also become more dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components that accommodate the new technology these results would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

   the price of hard disk drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors taken together result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants in addition product recalls can lead to a loss of market share which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   demand for our hard disk drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard disk drives in any given period as a result the hard disk drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which has led to intense price competition if intense price competition occurs we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenue and gross margins 

 

   over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems according to data released by trendfocus in november 2003 systems priced below 600 comprised the fastest growing segment of the desktop computer market if we are not able to offer a competitively priced hard disk drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results   the market for hard disk drives is also fragmenting into a variety of devices and products many industry analysts expect as do we that as communications are increasingly converted to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue to converge and hard disk drives will be found in many consumer products other than computers for example although general market acceptance remains in its early stages the use of hard disk drives has expanded into the game console market microsoft and sony currently incorporate a hard disk drive into their video game systems however there can be no assurance that these companies will continue incorporating a hard disk drive into their game consoles or that the market for these products will grow   in addition we expect that the consumer market for audiovideo products incorporating a hard disk drive will continue to grow however because this market remains relatively new although overall growth has been strong accurate forecasts for future growth remain challenging moreover some of the devices such as personal video recorders and digital video recorders may require attributes not currently offered in our products which may result in a need to expend capital increasing our overall operational expense if we are not successful in using our hard disk drive technology and 25 expertise to develop new products for the emerging consumer electronics market or if we are required to incur significant costs in developing such products it may harm our operating results 

 

   to remain a significant supplier of hard disk drives we will need to offer a broad range of hard disk drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch form factor hard disk drives for the desktop computer market however demand for hard disk drives may shift to products in smaller form factors which we do not currently offer but which some of our competitors offer in addition the enterprise and desktop pc industries are transitioning to higher speed interfaces such as sata to handle higher data transfer rates we currently offer sata products however the transition of technology and the introduction of new products is challenging and creates risks while we continue to develop new products and look to expand into nondesktop applications such as consumer electronics and mobile products the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp market acceptance effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products if we fail to successfully develop and manufacture new products customers may decrease the amount of our products that they purchase and we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products or who use their dominance in the enterprise or mobile market to encourage sales of desktop hard disk drives 

 

   our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard disk drive industry is intense volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel or skilled employees who have been granted stock options if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key personnel or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

   a majority of our revenue comes from a few customers for example during 2004 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for 51 of revenue as compared to 55 of revenue for 2003 these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer or if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs our operating results would likely be harmed in addition if customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished we could decide not to sell our products to a particular customer which could result in a decrease in our revenue 

 

   because we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain hard disk drive components and manufacturing equipment an increase in the cost of such components or equipment an extended shortage of required components or equipment or the failure of key suppliers to remain in business adjust to market conditions or to meet our quality yield or production requirements could significantly harm our operating results a number of the components used by us are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers and there is continued attrition and consolidation in our supplier base in addition some of the components or component types used in our products are used in other devices such as mobile telephones and digital cameras if there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component or component type from several high volume industries resulting in a supply reduction or a component is otherwise in short supply or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component in addition if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue 26   to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these components as a result we may be subject to cancellation charges if we cancel orders which may occur when we make technology transitions   in some cases not only are we dependent on a limited number of suppliers but we also have entered into contractual commitments that require us to buy a substantial number of components from certain suppliers for example we have entered into a volume purchase agreement with komag for the purchase of media components and volume purchase agreements with ibm and marvell for the purchase of read channel devices our future operating results may depend substantially on komag’s ability to timely qualify their components in our programs and each of komag’s ibm’s and marvell’s ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volume to meet our production requirements a significant disruption in any of these suppliers’ ability to manufacture and supply us with the components could harm our operating results   in addition certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or testing processes is available only from a limited number of suppliers some of this equipment uses materials that at times could be in short supply if these materials are not available or are not available in the quantities we require for our manufacturing and testing processes our ability to manufacture our products could be impacted and we could suffer significant loss of revenue 

 

   as a result of our head manufacturing operations we are developing and manufacturing a substantial portion of the heads used in the hard disk drives we manufacture consequently we are more dependent upon our own development and execution efforts and less able to take advantage of head technologies developed by other head manufacturers there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and costeffectively developing and manufacturing heads for products using perpendicular recording technology or other future technologies we also may not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using such technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs or we may encounter quality problems with the heads we manufacture in addition we may not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs if we fail to develop new technologies in a timely manner or if we encounter quality problems with the heads we manufacture and if we do not have access to external sources of supply that incorporate new technologies we would have a competitive disadvantage to companies that are successful in this regard and our business and financial results could suffer 

 

   our acquisition of head manufacturing assets represented a fundamental change in our operating structure as we are now manufacturing heads for use in the hard disk drives we manufacture consequently we carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than assumed in our prior financial business model if the overall level of production decreases for any reason our head manufacturing assets may face underutilization that may impact our results of operations we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including the need to operate at high levels of utilization to drive competitive costs and the need for assured supply of components especially hard disk drive media that is optimized to work with our heads   moreover capital expenditures and working capital investments required to support the head manufacturing operations including research and development expenses and expenses necessary to investigate new recording technologies to extend technology will increase   in addition we may incur additional costs expenses and risks including  27    if we do not adequately address the challenges related to our head manufacturing operations our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

 

   under our business model we do not manufacture any of the component parts used in our hard disk drives other than heads as a result of our acquisition of head manufacturing assets in july 2003 as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our major component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers each of which employs variations on technology which can impact for example feasible combinations of heads and media components in august 2003 we settled litigation we were engaged in with cirrus logic inc a supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard disk drives as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our profitability was at risk until another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   we use enterprise resource planning software in the operation of our business and maintenance of business and financial data related to our daily operations we are in the process of upgrading this software and we anticipate transitioning to new enterprise resource planning software during the next year we may experience unexpected difficulties in transitioning to the new software including difficulties related to the failure or inefficient operation of the new software such difficulties or failures could result in our inability to access business and financial information stored on the system or the loss of such information any inability to access or loss of such information could affect our daily operations including our ability to ship products and invoice our customers which could have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   some of our computer manufacturer customers also referred to as oems have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies that provide manufacturing services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk any credit losses we may suffer as a result of this increased risk would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

   our hard disk drives are manufactured in facilities in malaysia and in thailand in addition following our acquisition of head manufacturing assets in july 2003 we are operating a head wafer fabrication and research and 28 development facility in fremont california and a slider fabrication hga and hsa assembly and research and development facility in thailand a fire flood earthquake or other disaster condition or event that adversely affects any of these facilities or our ability to manufacture could result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results 

 

   the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 the united statesled military response to counter terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility including the war in iraq have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate further acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

   we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations including    because we manufacture our products abroad our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the thai baht a floating currency or a determination by the malaysian government to repeg the malaysian ringgit or convert it to a floating currency could result in an increase in our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results   we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward exchange contracts however those contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place as a result of the malaysian currency controls we are no longer hedging the malaysian currency risk currently we hedge the thai baht british pound sterling and the euro   there has been a trend toward a weakening us dollar relative to most foreign currencies if this trend continues the us dollar equivalents of unhedged manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion of our production costs are foreigncurrency denominated conversely there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues since revenues are substantially us dollar denominated 

 

   we may be subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries similar legislation may be enacted in other locations where we manufacture or sell our products   we could incur substantial costs in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations and we could also be subject to governmental fines and liability to our customers if we were to violate these laws if we 29 have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws or if we are subject to significant capital expenses in connection with a violation of these laws our financial condition or operating results could suffer 

 

   the hard disk drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   we are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders we also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would likely increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

   our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology despite safeguards to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

 

   we generally warrant our products for one to five years we test our hard disk drives in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means however there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market accordingly there is a risk that product defects will occur which could require a product recall product recalls can be expensive to implement and if a product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period we may be required to replace the defective product in addition a product recall may damage our relationship with our customers and we may lose market share with our customers including our oem customers   the standard warranties used by us contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for negligent or improper use of the products we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 30 

 

   we often ship a high percentage at times in excess of 50 of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results prior to the end of the quarter in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including  

 

   we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions key estimates and assumptions for us include  

 

   the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock  31    in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies   securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

   due to the risks described herein in the future we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital expenditures expansion or acquisition activity working capital and research and development we have a credit facility which matures on september 19 2008 and planned capital lease facilities if we decide to increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development efforts or if results of operations do not meet our expectations we could require additional debt or equity financing however we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available to us or available on acceptable terms an equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about foreign currency risk   although the majority of the company’s transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations the resulting impact from these hedge contracts is to offset a majority of the currency gains and losses in the company’s local currency operating expenses the contract maturity dates do not exceed six months the company does not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes currently the company focuses on hedging its foreign currency risk related to the thai baht the british pound sterling and the euro   as of july 2 2004 the company had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate     in 2004 2003 and 2002 total realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to the consolidated financial statements 32 disclosure about other market risks 

 

   at the option of the company borrowings under the senior credit facility would bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin if libor or the base rate increases the company’s interest payments could also increase at july 2 2004 the company had a 50 million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the senior credit facility would increase interest expense by approximately 05 million annually 33

 item 1 business general   western digital corporation the “company” or “western digital” designs develops manufactures and markets hard drives one of the key components found in most computers and data storage subsystems a hard drive is a device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks to allow fast access to nonvolatile data for computing needs the company’s hard drives are used in desktop personal computers servers network attached storage devices video game consoles digital video recording devices and satellite and cable settop boxes the company’s hard drive products currently include 10inch high 35inch form factor drives with capacities ranging from 8 gigabytes “gb” to 250 gb rotation speeds of 5400 7200 and 10000 revolutions per minute “rpm” and offer interfaces including enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” serial advanced technology attachment “sata” 1394firewireilink tm and universal serial bus “usb” the company sells its products worldwide to computer manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems or subsystems and to distributors resellers and retailers the company’s hard drive products are currently manufactured in malaysia and thailand for geographical financial data see the company’s consolidated financial statements and note 8 thereto included in this annual report on form 10k industry   desktop personal computer “pc” market according to trendfocus inc “trendfocus” quarterly reports for 2003 and calendar year 2002 the desktop computer segment is the largest segment of the worldwide personal computer market accounting for approximately 75 of global personal computer shipments in 2003 approximately 90 of western digital’s hard drive unit shipments in 2003 were sold to this market with the remaining shipments ultimately being used in other applications such as enterprise and consumer electronics markets desktop pc’s for entry level to experienced users are used in both commercial and consumer environments the demand for both hard drive capacity and unit volume of hard drives has grown in part due to    desktop pc’s are used in a number of environments ranging from homes to businesses and multiuser networks software applications are used on desktop pc’s primarily for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and other related applications hard drives store these software applications and the data used by these software applications   the industry continues to supply increased capacity per unit as users’ system needs increase and technological and manufacturing advances continue to make higher capacity drives more affordable in the mainstream desktop pc market the company believes that the rate of increase in storage capacity per unit has decreased from historical norms this may result in consumer demand for storage increases being balanced with the rate of improvement in the storage capacity per unit in contrast to currently established markets the emerging use of hard drives to record and play back audio and video content in the audiovideo market is expected to create demand for storage capacity at a rate that may exceed the growth in demand for increased capacity in the desktop pc market   increased consolidation in the industry has resulted in highly efficient operations improved economies of scale continued intense competition and supply chain optimization all of which tend to reduce the average selling price per hard drive unit the company believes that metrics such as customer quality total cost of ownership supply chain optimization and a stable supply of hard drives at attractive price levels will continue to be critical to its future success in serving both the audiovideo and desktop pc markets 3   since 1997 the pc industry has experienced decreasing average selling prices for desktop pc’s with large growth in both the sub1000 and sub600 segments trendfocus estimates that approximately 82 of all desktop pc’s sold in 2003 were priced below 1000 while 22 were priced below 600 manufacturers of these systems typically have a lower budget for both hard drive component cost and hard drive warranty expense and consequently the average selling price for hard drives to this segment of the desktop pc market has also declined   the company believes that three additional factors are impacting the growth of the pc market first the company believes that firsttime buyers of pc’s in the united states and western european pc markets are near saturation therefore new system sales in these regions are driven by replacement of older systems through technology obsolescence second the company believes that the cycle time in which existing pc owners replace their pc’s has lengthened from two to three years to approximately three to five years third uncertain economic conditions may have influenced potential customers to delay upgrading their overall information technology infrastructure for an additional discussion of changes in the pc market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   according to a march 2003 report published by trendfocus the worldwide desktop pc hard drive market excluding emerging product markets was forecasted to grow from approximately 155 million units in calendar year 2002 to approximately 197 million units in calendar year 2006 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6 revenue growth is expected to be slightly lower due to the impact of price competition trendfocus forecasted that revenue from sales of desktop pc hard drives would grow from approximately 119 billion in calendar year 2002 to approximately 147 billion in calendar year 2006 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5   small computer system interface “scsi” substitution market in certain circumstances scsi hard drives are being replaced by parallel advanced technology attachment “ata” or sata hard drives in enterprise storage applications sata is a relatively new interface technology that potentially improves the reliability availability scalability and performance attributes of parallel ata for enterprise environments trendfocus estimates that in calendar year 2003 approximately 19 of the enterprise drive market will utilize atasata hard drives and it forecasts that this amount will increase to 36 by 2006 western digital currently offers its wd raptor tm hard drive a 10000 rpm enterpriseclass drive with the sata interface and the wd caviar® sata hard drive a 7200 rpm large capacity hard drive for both desktop and “nearline” enterprise storage demand   emerging markets future demand growth for desktop computer hard drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard drive markets such as the audiovideo and video game console markets and accelerated growth in new “nearline” markets such as tape replacement according to a march 2003 report published by trendfocus the nondesktop pc 35inch form factor hard drive market was forecasted to grow from approximately 9 million units in calendar year 2002 to approximately 54 million units in calendar year 2006 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 57 for an additional discussion of the nondesktop pc hard drive market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   audiovideo market traditionally home users have “time shifted” television content by recording onto video tape by using a video cassette recorder “vcr” to view the content at a later time this market is experiencing the introduction of an alternative to vcrs where the video tape is being replaced by a hard drive that remains in the device these hard drivebased recorders commonly called personal video recorders “pvrs” or digital video recorders “dvrs” offer the enduser additional features that are not available using vcrs hard drive technology makes it possible to simultaneously record and play back content to pause and skip forward and backward while recording during live broadcasts and to rapidly access large amounts of audiovideo content   because the market for audiovideo products using hard drives has not yet developed accurate forecasts for future growth remain challenging for further discussion of the audiovideo market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   video game market according to trendfocus home electronic game devices that include hard disk drives and that are played on home entertainment systems had sales of approximately 7 million units in calendar year 2002 with an expected compound annual growth rate of approximately 29 through calendar year 2006 in calendar year 2001 microsoft introduced the xbox® video game system that uses a hard disk drive for game use in addition in may 2003 sony announced plans to release the psx tm product combining their playstation® 2 architecture with a 120 gb hard 4 drive depending on the continued success of the current xbox® video game system architecture and the acceptance of new combination devices such as sony’s psx tm product the video game market may continue to drive additional hard drive unit and revenue growth for an additional discussion of the video game market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

  “nearline” storage market traditional disaster recovery and backup of enterprise data has been done primarily on tape media used in tape and optical libraries which are devices that enable access to large volumes of data during the past few years a new data backup market opportunity has started to develop with eideata hard drives augmenting tape media this new trend popularly referred to as “nearline” storage has become an emerging technology due to both the ability of hard drives to back up data more quickly than tape solutions and the overall cost reduction trend in eideata class hard drives which is progressing at a faster rate than tape media cost reduction trends while an insignificant part of the overall market in 2003 the use of eideata drives as backup and disaster recovery technology has seen significant attention and product introductions   other market opportunities the company continuously evaluates opportunities to apply its data storage core competencies beyond traditional markets for hard drives currently new business opportunities are evaluated for their direct impact on the company’s ability to increase the sale of hard drives these opportunities include the design of hard drives for use in consumer devices such as gaming devices pvrs and dvrs and for use in higherend computer applications such as servers and server appliances the company monitors the development of new markets related to data or content storage and storage management the transfer use and storage of digital content and the continuing development of networking protocols and may from time to time offer new products or services to address appropriate new form factors interfaces or markets conversely depending on the development of such markets and the company’s ability to achieve its goals the company may from time to time withdraw from certain markets products   the company offers a broad line of hard disk drives designed for various market segments western digital’s products are marketed under the wd caviar® wd protégé® and wd raptor tm brand names and each product line is designed for a particular market segment the company’s wd caviar and wd protégé hard drive products are designed to serve distinct portions of the desktop pc market wd caviar hard drives are designed for the advanced performance segment of the desktop pc market and the entrylevel server market and wd protégé hard drives are designed for the value segment of the desktop pc market the entrylevel pc’s and the game console market the wd raptor hard drive is a sata hard drive designed for the enterprise storage market and highend desktop pc applications   desktop pc and entrylevel server hard drive products the wd caviar and wd protégé hard drive families currently consist of 10inch high 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 8 gb to 250 gb and rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 rpm these products utilize either the eide interface or the sata interface providing high performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection the type of eide interface currently used in a majority of the company’s hard drives is ata100 which signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second the sata interface available in certain of the company’s wd caviar special edition tm hard drives enables transfer rates as high as 150 megabytes per second the company also sells a line of external hard drives and related adapters which are designed to accommodate external storage interfaces including 1394firewireilink and usb the 1394firewireilink interface is a high speed interface that can be used to add additional storage capacity to a computer   the western digital product line generally leverages a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve the differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows the company to achieve lower costs through economies of scale purchasing this platform strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models the company expects to continue to utilize this platform strategy as it continues to develop products for the emerging market for hard drives specifically designed for audiovideo applications such as digital video recording devices 5   consumer electronics products the company offers design capabilities and hard drive technologies for consumer applications however where practical the company intends to leverage its existing product line architectures for the various products in the consumer electronics market the company currently offers two hard drive products designed for use in consumer audiovideo applications it also offers products for the video game console market such as the microsoft® xbox® video game system and provides hard drives for other consumer electronics products   mobile hard drive products the mobile hard drive market includes such products as notebook pc’s portable digital music players digital cameras and personal digital assistants pdas hard drives used in these products typically include 25 18 or 10inch form factor hard drives although the desktop pc market accounts for a majority of hard drive sales unit shipments of hard drives for the mobile market are increasing trendfocus forecasts that unit sales of hard drives to the mobile market will grow from approximately 33 million in calendar year 2002 to approximately 53 million in calendar year 2006 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 13 the company continuously evaluates the mobile market and has moved from technology staging to active design work on a 25inch form factor drive to target the mobile market technology and product development   hard drives are used to record store and retrieve digital data their performance attributes are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical disk drives and tapes and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard drive performance include    all of the company’s hard drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard drive are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board the head disk assembly includes the head media disks head positioning mechanism actuator and spin motor these components are contained in a hard base plate protective package in a contaminationcontrolled environment the printed circuit board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector   the head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spin motor disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk the sensor element of the head also known as the slider is getting progressively smaller requiring more accurate manufacturing processes   the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks that are divided into sectors the computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 6   industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interface for desktop pc’s is eide and the primary interface for enterprise systems is scsi as computer performance continues to improve the hard drive will need to deliver information faster than these interfaces can handle the company believes that the desktop pc industry plans to transition to higher speed interfaces such as sata to handle the higher data transfer rates the company currently offers its wd caviar special edition sata hard drive a 7200 rpm drive featuring capacities as large as 250 gb and designed for the highend pc workstation and entrylevel server markets the company believes that sata is also becoming a more popular interface in the enterprise market western digital currently offers its wd raptor hard drive a 10000 rpm enterpriseclass drive with the sata interface the company is working to develop additional products that will support these higher speed interfaces   storage capacity of the hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk areal density is generally measured in megabits per square inch of disk surface the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter as the areal density increases fewer disks andor heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity thus reducing product costs through reduced component requirements   head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density due to rapid technological changes there have been several generations of head technology in a relatively short period of time currently the desktop hard drive industry uses giant magnetoresistive head technology which allows significantly higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thinfilm head technology all of the company’s hard drive product offerings currently employ giant magnetoresistive head technology   constant innovations in research and development are essential to the company’s ability to compete hard drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of technological innovations designed to further increase hard drive performance and reduce product costs including simplifying the electronic architecture by combining the traditional controller channel microprocessor and servointerface management functions of traditional hard drive microprocessors on a single integrated circuit moreover to consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume production of new products some hard drive providers including the company are striving to simplify their product design processes by focusing on creating extendible core technology platforms which utilize common firmware and mechanical designs and reuse of manufacturing tooling and applicationspecific integrated circuits across various product generations and product lines   for an additional discussion of technological innovations see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” sales and distribution   the company sells its products globally to computer manufacturers distributors resellers systems integrators and retailers manufacturers typically purchase components such as hard drives and assemble them into the computer systems they build distributors typically sell the company’s drives to small computer manufacturers dealers systems integrators and other resellers   manufacturers sales to manufacturers accounted for 52 54 and 48 of the company’s revenue in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively during 2003 the company’s major computer manufacturer customers included dell emachines gateway hewlettpackard ibm and microsoft typically revenue from sales to certain manufacturers account for more than 10 of the company’s revenue for example during 2003 sales to dell and hewlettpackard including sales to compaq computer after its merger with hewlettpackard in 2002 accounted for 20 and 13 of revenue respectively during 2002 sales to dell and hewlettpackard including sales to compaq computer prior to its merger with hewlettpackard in 2002 accounted for 15 and 13 of revenue respectively during 2001 sales to dell and compaq computer accounted for 16 and 12 of revenue respectively the company believes that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve its strong relationships with the leading computer manufacturers since 2000 western digital maxtor which merged with quantum in 2000 and seagate have had the highest market share with these manufacturers 7   in 2003 the top seven desktop personal computer manufacturers accounted for approximately 49 of all shipments of desktop pc’s in the desktop pc market as a result maintaining customer satisfaction with these leading computer manufacturers is critical   computer manufacturers evaluate and select their hard drive suppliers based on a number of factors including overall quality storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability they typically seek to qualify two or three providers for each generation of hard drives and once a computer manufacturer has chosen its qualified hard drive vendors for a given product it generally will purchase hard drives from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with computer manufacturers’ qualifications a hard drive supplier must consistently offer hard drives featuring leading technology quality and high capacity per disk suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of high quality and reliable hard drives to quickly achieve high volume production a hard drive supplier must have access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities   many of the company’s computer manufacturer customers also referred to as original equipment manufacturers or “oems” have adopted justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” computer manufacturer does not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” computer manufacturer contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the computer manufacturer’s instructions for certain key oems the company maintains a base stock of several weeks on average of current finished goods inventory in facilities located adjacent to the oem’s operations inventory at these locations usually includes minor product customizations such as labeling for the related computer manufacturer if subsequent to its initial order the computer manufacturer changes its requirements inventory held at these facilities can be sold to other computer manufacturers or distributors “as is” or with minor modifications such as a change in labeling at little or no additional cost therefore changes in an oem’s requirements have minimal impact on inventory valuation   for an additional discussion of the need to adapt to customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to part ii item 7 under the headings “risk factors that may affect future results”   distributors the company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products to small computer manufacturers resellers dealers and systems integrators during 2003 the company’s major distributor customers included asi digiland esys distribution ingram micro tech data and tsr silicon resources distributors accounted for approximately 40 39 and 45 of the company’s revenue for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with the company for purchase and redistribution of product on a quick turnover basis blanket purchase orders are placed on a quarterly basis and shipments are made based upon a distributor’s weekly authorization the company grants its distributors price protection and certain distributors have limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis   retailers the company sells its retailpackaged products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores and authorizes sales through distributors to smaller retailers during 2003 major retailers to whom the company sold directly included best buy circuit city compusa fry’s electronics officemax and sam’s club retailers accounted for approximately 8 7 and 7 of the company’s revenue for each of 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the company’s current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe the retail channel complements the company’s other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for the company and its products retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade” sector in which endusers purchase and install products to upgrade their computers the company grants certain of its retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis the company also sells its retailpackaged products through the internet at its web site   the company maintains sales offices throughout north america eastern and western europe the middle east japan and asia pacific field application engineering is provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts and localized enduser technical support services are

50 and 47 of the company’s revenue for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs various trade regulations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”   for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and significant customer information see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements   the company’s marketing and advertising functions are performed both internally and through an outside firm advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials are targeted to various reseller and enduser segments western digital utilizes both consumer media and to a lesser extent trade publications the company has programs under which qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain marketing expenditures western digital also maintains customer relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing endusers with presale and postsale information and support through its web site competition   the company competes primarily with manufacturers of 35inch hard disk drives for desktop and server computers the company’s competitors in the hard drive market include fujitsu hitachi global storage technologies a joint venture formed in 2003 between hitachi and ibm maxtor samsung and seagate over the last three years the hard drive industry has experienced consolidation decreasing the number of major competitors in particular maxtor acquired the hard drive business of quantum fujitsu exited the desktop hard drive market and ibm sold its hard drive business to hitachi global storage technologies   the hard drive industry is intensely competitive with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies between different customer and market segments the company believes that it is generally competitive in all of these factors   based on quarterly reports published by trendfocus in 2003 and calendar year 2002 the company believes that its market share of hard disk drives sold worldwide during 2003 based on units shipped increased approximately 4 from approximately 13 to approximately 17 during 2003 western digital seagate maxtor and hitachi global storage technologies including sales by ibm and hitachi prior to the formation of the joint venture in 2003 supplied approximately 85 of the total hard drive market   the company believes that there are no substantial barriers to entry for competitors to offer competing products therefore the company believes that it cannot differentiate its hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly the company also differentiates itself by designing and incorporating into its hard drives desirable product performance attributes focusing on seek time data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics and data recovery in addition the company emphasizes nonproduct related attributes including rapid response with its computer manufacturer and distribution customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction the company also relies on the strength of the western digital brand name with valueadded resellers and solution providers to whom the company sells its hard drive products directly and indirectly the company believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard drive particularly within such a rapidly changing technology environment   the desktop hard drive market is characterized by several large competitors therefore it has traditionally been subject to periods of sustained and severe price competition and factors such as timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality can have a pronounced effect on the success of any particular product 9   advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than the company’s hard drive products highspeed semiconductor memory could compete with the company’s hard drive products in the future semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic disk drives but currently is not competitive from a cost standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance than hard drives it has lower “write” performance flash memory could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives   for an additional discussion of competition see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” service and warranty   western digital generally warrants its newly manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one to five years from the date of sale the company’s warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive the company has engaged third parties in brazil china germany india korea russia and singapore to process and test returned hard drives for the company’s customers in addition the company has contracted with a third party in canada to process returned hard drives and until july 2002 had engaged a third party to perform a similar service in the united states in july 2002 western digital assumed the processing and testing of hard drives in the united states and terminated the outsourcing of this function to the third party the company has engaged third parties to refurbish or repair its products at service facilities located in singapore and germany manufacturing   to be competitive western digital must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs the company strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility and high manufacturing yields while insisting that its suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of western digital’s hard drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key vendor relationships by establishing partner relationships with its strategic component suppliers the company believes it is able to access “bestofclass” manufacturing quality in addition the company believes that its sourcing strategy currently enables it to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve   hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and extensive testing to ensure reliability the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment which demands skill in process engineering and efficient utilization of the “clean room” layout in order to reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing environment the company’s clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells   the company produces hard drives in two plants one in malaysia and one in thailand the company continually evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs for example in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company closed two manufacturing facilities in singapore during 1999 and 2000 and relocated its hard drive production to malaysia during 2002 in response to an increase in demand and in order to capitalize on the local supplier base the company completed the acquisition of a thailand manufacturing facility the company continually evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs currently the company purchases all of the standard mechanical components and micro controllers for its hard drives from external suppliers   in july 2003 the company purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite corporation formerly one of the company’s suppliers of heads including its wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and its slider fabrication facility in bang pain thailand the company uses these facilities to design and manufacture head gimbal assemblies “hgas” and head stack assemblies “hsas” for use in disk drives it manufactures 10   for an additional discussion of manufacturing see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” research and development   the company devotes substantial resources to development of new products and improvement of existing products the company focuses its engineering efforts on coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in order to bring its products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses for continuing operations totaled 135 million 120 million and 113 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   for further discussion of product development see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” materials and supplies   the principal components currently used in the manufacture of the company’s hard drives are magnetic heads and related hsas media controllers spindle motors and mechanical parts used in the head disk assembly in addition to custom semiconductor devices the company also uses standard semiconductor components such as logic memory and microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a wide variety of other parts including connectors cables and other interconnect technology   the company acquires all of the components except for a portion of its heads for its products from third party suppliers in general the company tries to have multiple suppliers for each of its component requirements for example during 2003 the company bought giant magnetoresistive heads from alps electric co ltd readrite corporation and tdk corporation’s subsidiary sae magnetics ltd in june 2003 readrite commenced voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings western digital subsequently purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite including its wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and its slider fabrication facility located in bang pain thailand the company uses the assets purchased from readrite to design and manufacture hgas and hsas for use in disk drives it manufactures for additional information regarding the readrite acquisition see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” during 2003 the company’s media requirements were purchased from several outside vendors including fuji electric company ltd komag showa denko kk and trace storage technology corporation the company has a volume purchase agreement with komag under this agreement which expires in april 2005 the company is obligated to purchase a substantial percentage of its requirements for hard disk media from komag as long as komag’s prices technology and quality remain competitive   some custom integrated circuits are currently solesourced from stmicroelectronics ibm and marvell semiconductor inc the company has entered into volume purchase agreements with ibm and marvell to purchase read channel devices at negotiated quantities and prices because of their custom nature these products require significant designin periods and long lead times there has been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased integration of various separate circuits the company expects this trend to continue in the area of custom integrated circuits for hard drives   for an additional discussion of component supplies see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results” 

 

   historically a substantial portion of the company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order the company generally negotiates pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to the company with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition certain of the company’s sales to computer manufacturers are made under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead the company receives a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and the customer is invoiced upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse 11 therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the company’s revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods 

 

   the company owns numerous patents and has many patent applications in process the company believes that although its patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of its products depends primarily upon the technical and managerial competence of its personnel accordingly the patents held and applied for do not assure the company’s future success   in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights the company considers elements of its product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential the company believes that its nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of its process technology is an important factor in its success western digital relies upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect its proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the company conducts business also may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states   the company relies on certain technology that is licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its products the company believes that it has adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to its own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard drive industry   for additional discussion of intellectual property see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors that may affect future results”

  because ce demand for hard drives is relatively new with many consumer applications employing the same hard drive technology as is found in desktop pc’s western digital believes it can grow in this developing market without significant increases in operating expenses trendfocus estimates that unit shipments of hard drives in ce markets which totaled approximately 9 million units in calendar year 2002 will grow by approximately 57 per year through calendar year 2006   the company is pursuing new revenue opportunities in enterprise storage through its application of the new sata interface which the company believes over the next few years will replace the present parallel ata interface in desktop pc’s the sata interface contains many of the same benefits of the small computer systems interface or “scsi” — the predominant interface currently used in most enterprise hard drive applications — at a lower cost trendfocus estimates that 36 of enterprise hard drive unit shipments will use the ata sata interface by calendar year 2006 in addition the company is evaluating entering the mobile hard drive market trendfocus forecasts that unit sales of hard drives to the mobile market will grow from approximately 33 million in calendar year 2002 to approximately 53 million in calendar year 2006 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 13 fiscal 2003 overview   according to the june 2003 idc pc tracker data the desktop pc market the primary market for western digital’s products grew by less than 1 in fiscal year 2003 despite minimal growth in this market idc estimates that the hard disk drive market increased by 11 based on unit shipments in this environment western digital produced strong financial results by delivering highquality products at the right time and continuing to improve its efficiencies by controlling expenses and intensively managing working capital   western digital in 2003 produced a net revenue increase of 26 to 27 billion on unit shipments of 397 million based on quarterly reports published by trendfocus in 2003 and calendar 2002 the company believes that its market share in hard disk drives increased to 17 from 13 in 2002 greater revenue and strong cost control enabled the company to increase operating income by 268 to 187 million operating margins increased to 69 as a percentage of net revenue compared with 24 in 2002 strong fiscal management enabled western digital to generate 281 million in cash flow from operations in 2003 the company also retired all of its convertible debt and finished the year with 393 million in cash and cash equivalents an increase of 170 million from the prior year’s total recent developments   in june 2003 readrite corporation one of the company’s suppliers of heads commenced voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings on july 31 2003 in an effort to increase the company’s operational flexibility and ensure access to future head technologies western digital purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite corporation including the wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and the manufacturing facility in bang pain thailand the total cost of the acquisition will be between 170 million and 180 million this includes cash consideration of approximately 95 million assumed debt obligations of the thailand operations of approximately 60 million and direct costs of the acquisition and other miscellaneous assumed obligations totaling approximately 15 million to 25 million as of august 29 2003 the company has hired 4733 employees to continue the operations in california and thailand   as a result of the acquisition the company anticipates that its average gross margin will improve during the second half of 2004 as the acquired assets are integrated with those of the company however gross margin for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be lower due to startup expenses including factory employee severance costs and underabsorbed overhead related to low initial head production volumes the company expects that first quarter net income will be negatively impacted by onetime charges of up to 50 million for the aforementioned startup costs and acquired inprocess research and development costs 17 results of operations summary of 2003 2002 and 2001 comparison   the following table sets forth for the periods indicated summary information from the company’s statement of operations in millions  net revenue   net revenue was 27 billion for fiscal year 2003 an increase of 26 or 567 million from fiscal year 2002 total unit shipments increased to 397 million for the year as compared to 291 million from the prior year as a result of the company’s improved market share as well as an increase in demand for hard drives in the pc market average selling price “asp” decreased to 68 per unit for the year from 74 in 2002 historically asp’s in the desktop hard drive industry have generally declined annually in the 1020 range however those price declines have moderated over the past few quarters given longer product life cycles industry consolidation improved supply demand management and fewer component cost reduction opportunities   net revenue increased 198 million or 10 in 2002 from 2001 this increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments to 291 million in 2002 from 223 million in 2001 partially offset by a decrease in asp’s to 74 per unit from 88 per unit the significant change in units and asp’s in 2002 from 2001 is primarily due to expansion of the company’s hard drive product line into lowerend desktop pc and consumer electronics markets gross margin   for fiscal year 2003 gross margin percentage increased to 163 from 131 for 2002 the increase in gross margin percentage over the prior year was primarily the result of a more moderate pricing environment manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher unit volume and continuing cost reduction efforts offset by an 185 million charge related to the cirrus logic inc “cirrus” litigation settlement for fiscal year 2002 gross margin percentage increased to 131 from 106 for 2001 the increase in gross margin in 2002 from 2001 was primarily a result of more cost efficient designs and higher unit volume partially offset by lower asp’s operating expenses   total operating expenses consisting of research and development “rd” and selling general and administrative “sga” decreased to 94 of net revenue in fiscal 2003 as compared to 107 of net revenue in fiscal 2002 and 117 of net revenue in fiscal 2001 absolute dollar increases in operating expenses over the prior years is primarily due to higher payforperformance and retention plan expenses resulting from improved company performance   rd expense was 135 million 120 million and 113 million for fiscal year 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in rd expense in 2003 from 2002 of 15 million and in 2002 from 2001 of 7 million was due to increases in new development programs and higher employee incentive payments partially offset by expense reduction efforts 18   sga expense was 121 million 111 million and 116 million for fiscal year 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in sga expense in 2003 from 2002 of 10 million was primarily related to higher incentive payments resulting from improved operational results the decrease in sga expense in 2002 from 2001 of 5 million was primarily due to expense reduction efforts partially offset by higher employee incentive payments interest and other income expense   net interest and other income expense was 16 million 14 million and 307 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively this includes net investment gains of 34 million in 2003 48 million in 2002 and investment writeoffs and related lease contingency accruals of 524 million offset by gains on the redemption of debenture of 224 million in 2001 excluding these items net interest and other expense was 18 million 34 million and 07 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in net expense in 2003 was primarily due to the company’s redemption of its convertible debentures resulting in lower interest expense the increase in net expense in 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates income tax expense benefit   income tax expense was 76 million in 2003 as compared to the income tax benefit of 11 million in 2002 the increase in the income tax expense of 87 million from 2002 is primarily related to an increase in earnings within certain tax jurisdictions differences between the effective tax rate for 2003 of 4 as compared to the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to earnings of certain subsidiaries which are taxed at substantially lower tax rates as compared with us statutory rates and the partial utilization of net operating loss “nol” carryforwards the company’s 2002 net income tax benefit of 11 million included a federal income tax refund of 31 million for a loss carryback available as a result of tax legislation enacted during the year during 2001 the company did not record an income tax benefit as no loss carrybacks were available at that time see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements discontinued operations   during 2002 the company discontinued the operations of new business ventures including connex inc “connex” sanavigator inc “sanavigator” and keen personal media inc “keen” the company sold substantially all of the assets of its connex and sanavigator businesses for a net gain of 245 million and terminated the keen operations these operating losses for the periods reported and the net gain recognized on the sale of connex and sanavigator have been segregated from continuing operations and reported separately on the statements of operations as discontinued operations during 2003 the company settled the remaining debt obligations related to one of the discontinued operations and as a result of a favorable settlement recorded a gain of 13 million liquidity and capital resources   the company had cash and cash equivalents of 393 million at june 27 2003 and 224 million at june 28 2002 net cash provided by continuing operations was 281 million and 83 million during 2003 and 2002 respectively this 198 million improvement in cash provided by continuing operations consists of a 149 million improvement in the company’s net income net of noncash items and a 49 million increase in cash provided by working capital these improvements are due to significantly better operating performance by the company including higher sales volume and improved cost management   the company’s cash conversion cycle which represents the sum of the number of days sales outstanding “dso” and days inventory outstanding “dio” less days payable outstanding “dpo” was negative 9 days for 2003 and 2002 accounts receivable at june 27 2003 was higher than the prior year as a result of higher fourth quarter revenue combined with longer average collection days however this increase in average collection days was offset by improved inventory turns and longer payment days with suppliers the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased to 5 million at june 27 2003 from 8 million at june 28 2002 as a result of the writeoff of fully reserved accounts receivable balances which management determined to be uncollectable   other uses of cash during 2003 included net capital expenditures of 62 million primarily to upgrade the company’s desktop hard drive production capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets 88 million for the extinguishment or redemption of the company’s remaining 525 zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures 19 due february 18 2018 and 6 million for the repayment of a subsidiary’s loan other sources of cash during 2003 included 44 million received in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 

  other uses of cash during 2002 included net capital expenditures of 48 million primarily for normal replacement of existing assets and the purchase of assets for the company’s manufacturing facility in thailand and 18 million for debenture redemptions   other sources of cash during 2002 included 10 million received from the sale of assets and 10 million received in connection with stock option and warrant exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases   in 2003 discontinued operations used 3 million of cash in 2002 discontinued operations provided 18 million of cash which included approximately 37 million net proceeds from asset sales   as discussed above under the heading “recent developments” western digital purchased substantially all of the assets of readrite corporation including the wafer fabrication equipment in fremont california and the manufacturing facility in bang pain thailand for 95 million plus the assumption of liabilities and other costs of between 75 million and 80 million the company funded the purchase of these assets through working capital for additional discussion on this acquisition see below under the heading “risk factors that may effect future results”   on august 22 2003 the company agreed to settle its outstanding litigation with cirrus under the terms of the agreement the company will make a onetime payment to cirrus on or before october 17 2003 of 45 million western digital had previously recorded an obligation totaling approximately 265 million related to the disputed payables the difference of approximately 185 million between the settlement amount and the amount previously recorded was included in the cost of sales for the fourth quarter and year ended june 27 2003   the company anticipates that capital expenditures in 2004 will be between 140 million to 160 million including between 70 million and 90 million relating to the company’s new head manufacturing operations   on september 19 2003 the company entered into a new 125 million fiveyear credit facility “senior credit facility” replacing the facility that matured on september 20 2003 the new senior credit facility provides up to 75 million in revolving credit and a term loan of 50 million subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation both the term loan and revolving credit facility mature on september 19 2008 and are secured by the company’s accounts receivable inventory 65 of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets at the option of the company borrowings bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin the senior credit facility requires the company to maintain certain levels of income prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number of other covenants the 50 million term loan was funded on september 22 2003 and requires quarterly principal payments of 3 million beginning in october 2004 the company intends to use the proceeds from the term loan to repay obligations incurred as a result of the readrite asset acquisition there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility however the company has issued a 25 million standby letter of credit under the facility to cirrus concerning the 265 million in disputed accounts payable as discussed in the company’s consolidated financial statements the cirrus litigation has been settled and upon payment of the settlement on or before october 17 2003 the letter of credit will be released refer to part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 5 “legal proceedings” included in this annual report on form 10k   the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that the senior credit facility will continue to be available to the company also the company’s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the headings “risk factors that may affect future results” 20 commitments   the following is a summary of the company’s significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at june 27 2003 operating leases   the company leases certain facilities and equipment under longterm noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2012 the following table summarizes the future payments of these leases in millions    in connection with its acquisition of the assets of readrite in july 2003 the company will assume readrite’s lease of an approximately 181000 square foot facility in fremont california that is used for wafer fabrication the lease expires in february 2008 with annual rental payments of 19 million purchase orders   in the normal course of business to reduce the risk of component shortages the company enters into purchase commitments with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture the company’s products these commitments generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter become payable upon receipt of the components and may be noncancelable cancellation charges may be significant the company’s relationship with suppliers allows for some flexibility within these commitments and quantities are subject to change as a quarter progresses and the company’s needs change forward exchange contracts   although the majority of the company’s transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the company does not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes as of june 27 2003 the company had 36 million outstanding of purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts the contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed three months at june 27 2003 the carrying value of the contracts approximates fair value critical accounting policies   the company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenue expenses assets and liabilities the company has adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates the company believes the following are its most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve management’s judgment and estimates if these estimates differ materially from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 21 revenue and accounts receivable   in accordance with standard industry practice the company has agreements with resellers that provide price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions in addition the company may have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation on slowmoving items and other incentive programs in accordance with current accounting standards the company recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers adjustments are based on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers as well as historical pricing information if endmarket demand for hard drives declines significantly the company may have to increase sellthrough incentive payments to resellers resulting in an increase in price protection allowances which could adversely impact operating results   the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition the company routinely analyzes the different receivable aging categories and establishes reserves based on the length of time receivables are past due if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required which could negatively affect operating results   the company records provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized the company bases these provisions on existing product return notifications as well as historical returns by product type see “warranty” if actual sales returns exceed expectations an increase in the sales return provision would be required which could negatively affect operating results warranty   the company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized warranty covers cost of repair or replacement of the hard drive over the warranty period which ranges from one to five years the company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty which include specific detail on hard drives in the field by product type historical field return rates and costs to repair if actual product return rates or costs to repair returned products increase above expectations an increase in the warranty provision would be required which could negatively affect operating results inventory   inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value inventory writedowns are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances   the company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information the company writes down inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products which may require an increase in inventory writedowns which could negatively affect operating results litigation and other contingencies   the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “sfas 5” to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies accordingly the company accrues loss contingencies when management in consultation with its legal advisors concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable refer to part ii item 8 notes to consolidated financial statements note 5 “legal proceedings” included in this annual report on form 10k deferred tax assets   the company’s deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are fully reserved due to management’s determination that it is “more likely than not” that these assets will not be realized this determination is based on the weight of available evidence the most significant of which is the company’s loss 22 history in the related tax jurisdictions should this determination change in the future some amount of deferred tax assets could be recognized resulting in a tax benefit or a reduction of future tax expense 

risk factors that may affect future results 

 

   to achieve consistent success with computer manufacturer customers we must balance four key attributes timetomarket timetovolume quality and cost if we fail to  our operating results would be adversely affected 

 

   new products may require higher areal densities the gigabyte of storage per disk than previous product generations posing formidable technical challenges higher areal densities require fewer heads and disks to achieve a given drive capacity which means that existing head technology must be improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on a single disk in addition our introduction of new products during a technology transition increases the likelihood of unexpected quality concerns our failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and at acceptable costs would put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results 

 

   the rate of increase in areal density may be greater than the increase in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity this could lead to our customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with more lowercost singlesurface drives thereby decreasing our revenue as a result even with increasing aggregate demand for storage capacity our asp’s could decline which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

   product life cycles have extended during the past twelve months due to a decrease in the rate of hard drive areal density growth however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue historically more rapid increases in areal density resulted in shorter product life cycles with each generation of hard drives being more cost efficient than the previous one shorter product life cycles makes it more difficult to recover the cost of product development before the product becomes obsolete although we believe that the current rate of growth in areal density is lower than in the past several years and will continue to decrease in the near term we expect that areal density will continue to increase our failure to recover the cost of product development in the future could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   longer product life cycles have resulted from a decrease in the rate of areal density growth in the past twelve months if longer product life cycles continue we may need to develop new technologies or programs such as systemonachip to reduce our costs on any particular product in order to maintain competitive pricing for such product this may 23 result in an increase in our overall expenses and a decrease in our gross margins both of which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   we regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers to be considered for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with our new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing failures or delays in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume computer manufacturers most of which continue to consolidate their share of the pc market if product life cycles continue to be extended due to a decrease in the rate of areal density growth we may have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer which could harm our competitive position these risks are increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining gross margins on our current generation products 

 

   if one of our competitors were able to implement a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that enables a “stepchange” increase in areal density that permits greater storage of data on a disk it could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our operating results   advances in magnetic optical semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products if these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity we could be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those products 

 

   the hard disk drive industry has experienced declining asp’s in recent years although the rate of decline has decreased in recent quarters there can be no assurance that this trend will continue increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same capacity and therefore lower component cost because of the competitiveness of the hard drive industry lower costs generally mean lower prices this is true even for those products that are competitive and introduced into the market in a timely manner our asp’s decline even further when competitors lower prices as a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share a continued decline in asp’s could cause our operating results to suffer 

 

   the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors taken together result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants for example during the first quarter of 2000 the company lost market share as a result of a product recall similar losses in market share could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market has experienced periods of excess capacity which has led to intense price competition during the middle of 2003 the industry experienced weak pc demand in the us and other markets due in part to general economic conditions worldwide if intense price competition occurs as a result of weak demand we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenue and gross margins 24 

 

   over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems according to data released by international data corporation tracker in december 2002 systems priced below 600 currently comprise the fastest growing segment of the consumer market for desktop computers although we were late to market with a value line hard drive to serve the lowcost pc market we are now offering such value line products at prices that we view as competitive however if we are not able to continue to offer a competitively priced value line hard drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results   in addition the pc market is fragmenting into a variety of computing devices and products some of these products may not contain a hard drive on the other hand many industry analysts expect as do we that as communications are increasingly converted to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics will continue to converge and hard drives will be found in many consumer products other than computers for example several game console manufacturers have expressed support for hard drives in their products however market acceptance of the use of hard drives in game consoles remains in its early stages in addition some consumer electronics such as pvrs and dvrs may require attributes not currently offered in our products which may result in a need to expend capital increasing our overall operational expense if we are not successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for the emerging consumer electronics market or if we are required to incur significant costs in developing such products it may harm our operating results 

 

   to remain a significant supplier of hard disk drives we will need to offer a broad range of disk drive products to our customers we currently offer a variety of 35inch form factor hard disk drives for the desktop computer market however demand for desktop hard drives may shift to products in smaller form factors which we do not currently offer but which some of our competitors offer in addition the desktop pc industry is transitioning to higher speed interfaces such as sata to handle higher data transfer rates and 80 gb per platter technology for increased capacity the company currently offers sata and 80 gb per platter products however the transition of technology and the introduction of new products is challenging and creates risks while we continue to develop new products and look to expand into nondesktop applications such as consumer electronics and mobile products the success of our new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors including difficulties faced in manufacturing ramp market acceptance effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand and the risk that our new products will have quality problems or other defects in the early stages of introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products if we fail to successfully develop and manufacture new products customers may decrease the amount of our products that they purchase and we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products or who use their dominance in the enterprise or mobile market to encourage sales of desktop hard drives 

 

   our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel or skilled employees who have been granted stock options if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key personnel or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed 

 

   a majority of our revenue comes from a few customers for example during 2003 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 55 of revenue these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer or if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs our operating results would likely be harmed for example this occurred with 25 our scsi enterprise hard drive product line early in the third quarter of 2000 and is one of the factors which led to our decision to exit the scsi enterprise hard drive market 

 

   because we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain hard drive components an extended shortage of required components or the failure of key suppliers to remain in business adjust to market conditions or to meet our quality yield or production requirements could significantly harm our operating results a number of the components used by us are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers and there is continued attrition and consolidation in our supplier base in june 2003 readrite corporation one of our suppliers of heads commenced voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings in july 2003 we acquired the assets of readrite in an effort to increase our operational flexibility and ensure our access to future head technologies although it is anticipated that our acquisition will reduce our dependence on outside suppliers for heads we may not be able to supply all of our head needs and therefore we may still be required to purchase heads as well as other hard drive components from outside sources if a component is in short supply or a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component in addition if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue for example we lost revenue in september 1999 when we had to shut down production of a product line for approximately two weeks as a result of a faulty power driver chip that was solesourced from a third party supplier   to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these components as a result we may have to pay significant cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders as we did in 1998 when we accelerated our transition to giant magnetoresistive head technology and as we did in 2000 as a result of our decision to exit the scsi enterprise hard drive market   in some cases not only are we dependent on a limited number of suppliers but we also have entered into contractual commitments that require us to buy a substantial number of components from certain suppliers for example in april 1999 we entered into a threeyear volume purchase agreement with komag under which we buy a substantial portion of our media components from komag in october 2001 we amended the komag volume purchase agreement to extend the initial term to six years similarly we have entered into contractual commitments with both ibm and marvell for the supply of our read channel devices in february 2001 we entered into a twoyear volume purchase agreement with ibm under which we buy a portion of our read channel devices from ibm effective june 2002 we amended the ibm volume purchase agreement to extend the initial term through december 31 2003 in addition in june 2002 we entered into a fiveyear volume purchase agreement with marvell under which we buy a portion of our read channel devices from marvell these relationships have increased our dependence on each of komag ibm and marvell as a supplier our future operating results may depend substantially on komag’s ability to timely qualify its media components in our new development programs and each of komag’s ibm’s and marvell’s ability to supply us with these components in sufficient volume to meet our production requirements a significant disruption in komag’s ability to manufacture and supply us with media components or ibm’s or marvell’s ability to manufacture and supply us with read channel devices could harm our operating results 

 

   as a result of our acquisition of the assets of readrite we are developing and manufacturing heads for use in the hard drives we manufacture consequently we will be more dependent upon our own development efforts and less able to take advantage of head technologies developed by other head manufacturers in november 2002 readrite announced that it had achieved an areal density of 146 gigabits per square inch using perpendicular recording technology there can be no assurance however that we will be successful in timely and cost effectively developing and manufacturing heads for products using perpendicular recording technology or other future technologies we also may not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields using such technologies necessary to satisfy our customers’ product needs in addition we may not have access to external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs if we fail to timely manufacture heads containing leading technology or if we are unable to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of heads our ability to sell our products may be adversely affected moreover if we fail to develop new technologies in a timely manner and if our 26 competitors succeed in doing so or have access to external sources of supply that incorporate such new technologies our business and financial results could suffer 

 

   in july 2003 we acquired the assets of readrite corporation formerly one of our suppliers of heads and we are in the process of integrating the acquired assets into our company we may not successfully address the integration challenges in a timely manner or at all integration requires varying levels of management resources which may divert our attention from other business operations it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate the assets products technologies or personnel of readrite which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   our acquisition of readrite’s assets represents a fundamental change in our operating structure as we are now manufacturing heads for use in the hard drives we manufacture due to the vertical integration of part of our supply chain we carry a higher percentage of fixed costs than traditionally assumed in our overall business model if the overall level of production decreases for any reason the acquired assets may face underutilization that may impact our results of operations we are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall asset utilization including    moreover capital expenditures and working capital investments required to operate readrite’s assets will utilize additional cash for example while the purchased assets of readrite including intellectual property head designs and manufacturing equipment would indicate successful internal qualification of a western digitalmanufactured 80 gb per platter giant magnetoresistive head we expect significant investment in research and development and investigation of new recording technologies to extend recording technology will be required the company expects its capital expenditures viewed as an average over several years to increase by approximately 70 million to 90 million to support the acquired manufacturing operations of readrite   in addition we may incur additional costs expenses and risks including  27    if we do not adequately address the challenges related to the acquisition our ongoing operations could be disrupted resulting in a decrease in our revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating results 

 

   under our business model we do not manufacture any of the component parts used in our hard drives other than heads as a result of our recent acquisition of the assets of readrite as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our strategic component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers each of which employs variations on technology which can impact for example feasible combinations of heads and media components until recently we were engaged in litigation with cirrus a supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel devices for our hard drives we settled this litigation in august 2003 as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our business operations were at risk until another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   some of our oem customers have adopted a subcontractor model that requires us to contract directly with companies that provide manufacturing services to our oem customers because these subcontractors are generally not as well capitalized as our direct oem customers this subcontractor model exposes us to increased credit risks our agreements with our oem customers may not permit us to increase our product prices to alleviate this increased credit risk any credit losses we may suffer as a result of this increased risk would increase our operating costs which may negatively impact our operating results 

 

   the majority of our hard drive manufacturing volume comes from one facility in malaysia during 2002 we acquired a second smaller manufacturing facility in thailand in addition following our acquisition of the assets of readrite in july 2003 we are operating a wafer fabrication facility in fremont california and a slider fabrication facility in thailand a fire flood earthquake or other disaster condition or event that adversely affects any of these facilities or our ability to manufacture could result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results 

 

   the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 the united statesled military response to counter terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates further acts of terrorism either domestically or abroad could create further uncertainties and instability to the extent this results in disruption or delays of our manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

   we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations including  28    we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward exchange contracts however those contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place which occurred in malaysia during the first quarter of 1999 as a result of the malaysian currency controls we are no longer hedging the malaysian currency risk currently we hedge the euro thai baht and british pound sterling 

 

   the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   we are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders we also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights if claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would likely increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

   our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology despite safeguards to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 

 

   we generally warrant our products for one to five years the standard warranties used by us contain limits on damages and exclusions of liability for consequential damages and for negligent or improper use of the products we record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized we may incur additional operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products if these additional expenses are significant it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 29   inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly results   we often book and ship a high percentage at times in excess of 50 of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results prior to the end of the quarter in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including    rapidly changing market conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to estimate actual results   we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions key estimates and assumptions for us include    the market price of our common stock is volatile   the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock  30    in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies   securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

   due to the risks described herein in the future we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital expenditures expansion or acquisition activity working capital and research and development we have a credit facility which matures on september 19 2008 if we decide to increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development efforts or if results of operations do not meet our expectations we could require additional debt or equity financing however we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available to us or available on acceptable terms an equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about foreign currency risk   although the majority of the company’s transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations the resulting impact from these hedge contracts is to offset a majority of the currency gains and losses in the company’s local currency operating expenses the contract maturity dates do not exceed three months the company does not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes currently the company focuses on hedging its foreign currency risk related to the thai baht british pound sterling and the euro   as of june 27 2003 the company had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts in millions except weighted average contract rate    in 2003 2002 and 2001 total realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to the consolidated financial statements based on historical experience the company does not expect that a significant change in foreign exchange rates would materially affect the company’s consolidated financial statements disclosure about other market risks 

 

   during 2003 the company redeemed its remaining outstanding 525 zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due february 18 2018 the “debentures” and paid 88 million in cash and issued approximately 01 million shares of common stock the aggregate principal amount at maturity was 194 million 31 

 

   at the option of the company borrowings under the senior credit facility would bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin determined by the borrowing base this is the only company borrowing facility which does not have a fixedrate of interest at june 27 2003 there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility

 item 1 business general   western digital corporation the “company” or “western digital” designs develops manufactures and markets hard drives featuring leadingedge technology a hard drive is a storage device found in most computers that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks that provide fast access to data that must be readily available to users of computers or other devices the company’s hard drives are used in desktop personal computers servers network attached storage devices video game consoles digital video recording devices and satellite settop boxes the company’s hard drive products currently include 10inch high 35inch form factor drives with capacities ranging from 8 gigabytes “gb” to 200 gb rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 revolutions per minute “rpm” and the enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” interface the company sells its products worldwide to computer manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems or subsystems and to distributors resellers and retailers the company’s hard drive products are currently manufactured in malaysia and thailand for geographical financial data see the company’s consolidated financial statements and note 9 thereto included in this annual report on form 10k industry   desktop personal computer “pc” market according to trendfocus inc “trendfocus” quarterly reports for 2002 and calendar year 2001 the desktop computer segment is the largest segment of the worldwide personal computer market accounting for approximately 75 of global personal computer shipments in 2002 as a result according to trendfocus desktop computers were the leading source of demand for hard drives accounting for more than 71 of all hard drive units shipped worldwide in 2002 over 89 of western digital’s hard drive unit shipments in 2002 were sold to this market desktop personal computers for entry level to experienced users are used in both commercial and consumer environments the demand for both hard drive capacity and unit volume of hard drives continues to grow in part due to    according to a march 2002 report published by trendfocus the worldwide desktop pc hard drive market excluding emerging markets was forecasted to grow from approximately 142 million units in calendar year 2001 to approximately 177 million units in calendar year 2005 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6 revenue growth is expected to be lower due to the impact of severe price competition trendfocus also forecasted that revenue from sales of desktop pc hard drives would grow from approximately 13 billion in calendar year 2001 to approximately 14 billion in calendar year 2005 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2   desktop pc’s are used in a number of environments ranging from homes to businesses and multiuser networks software applications are used on desktop pc’s primarily for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and other related applications hard drives store these software applications and the data used by these software applications desktop pc’s typically 3 utilize the eide interface for hard drives trendfocus estimates that the average capacity sold per desktop unit in calendar year 2001 was 291 gb with 91 of all shipments in excess of 10gb in the desktop segment 

  the industry continues to supply increased capacity per unit as users’ system needs increase and technological and manufacturing advances continue to make higher capacity drives more affordable in the mainstream desktop pc market the company believes that the rate of increase in storage capacity per unit has outpaced the rate of increase in user demand for such capacity in recent years this will result in the company changing its product mix with an increasing percentage of lower capacity lower cost hard drives manufactured with fewer heads and disks per unit the company believes that even though unit demand will increase this changing product mix will reduce the average selling price per hard drive unit in the desktop pc market unless the rate of technology improvements decreases in contrast to currently established markets the emerging use of hard drives to record and play back audio and video content in the audiovideo market is expected to create demand for storage capacity at a rate that may exceed the growth in demand for increased capacity in the desktop pc market accordingly the company believes that timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality leadership with higher capacity drives at attractive price levels will continue to be critical to its future success in serving this market   since 1997 the pc industry has experienced an increasing shift toward desktop pc’s priced below 1000 trendfocus estimates that approximately 67 of all desktop pc’s sold in 2002 were priced below 1000 these systems typically incorporate lower cost components and consequently the average selling price for hard drives to this segment of the desktop pc market has also declined   the company believes that two additional factors are impacting the growth of the pc market first the company believes that the united states and western european pc markets are nearing saturation in addition the company believes that the cycle time in which existing pc owners replace their pc’s has lengthened from two to three years to approximately three to four years for an additional discussion of changes in the pc market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate”   emerging markets future demand growth for desktop computer hard drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard drive markets such as the audiovideo video game console and tape replacement markets according to a march 2002 report published by trendfocus the nondesktop pc 35inch form factor hard drive market was forecasted to grow from approximately 4 million units in calendar year 2001 to approximately 93 million units in calendar year 2005 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 118 for an additional discussion of the nondesktop pc hard drive market see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate”   audiovideo markets traditionally home users have “time shifted” television content by recording onto video tape by using a video cassette recorder “vcr” to view the content at a later time this market is experiencing the introduction of an alternative to vcrs where the video tape is being replaced by a hard drive that remains in the device these hard drivebased recorders commonly called personal video recorders “pvrs” offer the enduser additional features that are not available using vcrs hard drive technology makes it possible to simultaneously record and play back content to pause and skip forward and backward while recording during live broadcasts and to rapidly access large amounts of audiovideo content   because the market for audiovideo products using hard drives has not yet developed it is too early to project the likely size and growth of such market for further discussion of this product development effort see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly”   video game market according to trendfocus home electronic game devices that include hard disk drives and that are played on home entertainment systems had sales of approximately 2 million units in calendar year 2001 with an expected compound growth rate of approximately 82 through calendar year 2005 in calendar year 2001 microsoft introduced a new game system called xbox tm that uses a hard disk drive for game use depending on the overall success of the current xbox tm architecture in the market and perceived advantages due to incorporation of hard drive technology overall hard drive sales may continue to increase with sales of xbox tm and other potential manufacturers of game consoles which integrate hard drives 4 into future designs see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” 

  tape replacement market traditional disaster recovery and backup of enterprise data has been done primarily on tape media used in tape libraries which are devices that enable rapid access to large volumes of data during the past few years a new data backup market opportunity has started to develop with integrated drive electronics “ide” advanced technology attachment “ata” hard drives augmenting tape media this new trend referred to as “disk to disk backup” has become an emerging technology due to both the ability of hard drives to back up data more quickly than tape solutions and the overall cost reduction trend on ide ata class hard drives at a faster rate than tape cost reduction trends while an insignificant part of the overall market in 2002 the use of ide ata drives as backup and disaster recovery technology has seen significant attention and product introductions   small computer system interface “scsi” substitution in certain circumstances scsi hard drives are being replaced by ide ata hard drives in enterprise storage applications the company believes that in calendar year 2002 approximately 10 of the enterprise drive market will utilize ide serial ata hard drives   other market opportunities the company continuously evaluates opportunities to apply its data storage core competencies beyond traditional markets for hard drives currently new business opportunities are evaluated for their direct impact on the company’s ability to increase the sale of hard drives these opportunities include the design of hard drives for use in consumer devices such as gaming devices or pvrs and for use in higherend computer applications such as servers and server appliances the company monitors the development of new markets related to data or content storage and storage management the transfer use and storage of digital content and the continuing development of networking protocols and may from time to time offer new products or services to address appropriate new form factors interfaces or markets conversely depending on the development of such markets and the company’s ability to achieve its goals the company may from time to time withdraw from certain markets products   the company’s wd caviar® and wd protégé tm hard drive products are designed to serve distinct portions of the desktop pc market wd caviar is designed for the advanced performance segment of the desktop pc market and the entrylevel server market and wd protégé is designed for the value segment of the desktop pc market the entrylevel pc’s and the game console market in addition the company’s wd performer tm hard drive products are designed to serve the emerging audiovideo portion of the hard drive market   desktop pc and entrylevel server hard drive products the wd caviar and wd protégé families currently consist of 10inch high 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 8 gb to 200 gb and rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 rpm these products utilize the eide interface providing high performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection the type of eide interface currently used in all of the company’s hard drives is ata100 which signifies a burst data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second the company also sells a line of external hard drives and related adapters which are designed to accommodate external storage interfaces including 1394 firewireilink tm and universal serial bus 20 the 1394 firewireilink tm interface is a high speed interface that can be used to add additional storage capacity to a computer   the western digital product line generally leverages a common platform for various products within product families with different capacities to serve the differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products within product families which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows the company to achieve lower costs through economies of scale purchasing this platform strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models the company expects to continue to utilize this platform strategy as it develops products for the emerging market for hard drives specifically designed for audiovideo applications such as new digital video recording devices 5   nonpc hard drive products the company offers customized design capabilities and unique hard drive technologies for consumer applications however where practical the company intends to leverage its existing product line architectures for the various products for the audiovideo market the company is currently offering the wd performer hard drive product line designed for use in consumer audiovideo applications it also offers products for the video game console market such as the microsoft® xbox tm  the company is also developing hard drives and products incorporating hard drive technology for other consumer electronics products including digital cable settop boxes and audiovideo jukeboxes technology and product development   hard drives are used to record store and retrieve digital data their performance attributes are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical disk drives and tapes and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard drive performance include    all of the company’s hard drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard drive are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board the head disk assembly includes the head media disks head positioning mechanism actuator and spin motor these components are contained in a hard base plate protective package in a contaminationcontrolled environment the printed circuit board includes both standard and custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector   the head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spin motor disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk the sensor element of the head also known as the slider is getting progressively smaller requiring more accurate manufacturing processes   the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric tracks which are divided into sectors the computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved   industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interface for desktop pc’s is eide increasingly work station computers are using the eide interface as well as computer performance continues to improve the hard drive will need to deliver information faster than this interface can handle accordingly the company believes that the desktop 6 pc industry plans to transition to higher speed interfaces such as “serial ata” to handle the higher data transfer rates the company is working to develop products that will support these higher speed interfaces 

  storage capacity of the hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk areal density is generally measured in megabits per square inch of disk surface the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter as the areal density increases fewer disks and or heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity thus reducing product costs through reduced component requirements   head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density due to rapid technological changes there have been several generations of head technology in a relatively short period of time currently the desktop hard drive industry uses magnetoresistive head technology which allows significantly higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thinfilm head technology all of the company’s hard drive product offerings currently employ magnetoresistive head technology   constant innovations in research and development are essential to the company’s ability to compete hard drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of technological innovations designed to further increase hard drive performance and reduce product costs including simplifying the electronic architecture by combining the traditional controller channel microprocessor and servointerface management functions of traditional hard drive microprocessors on a single integrated circuit moreover to consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume production of new products some hard drive providers including the company are striving to simplify their product design processes by focusing on creating extendible core technology platforms which utilize common firmware and mechanical designs and reuse of manufacturing tooling and applicationspecific integrated circuits across various product generations and product lines   for an additional discussion of technological innovations see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” sales and distribution   the company sells its products globally to computer manufacturers distributors resellers systems integrators and retailers manufacturers typically purchase components such as hard drives and assemble them into the computer systems they build distributors typically sell the company’s drives to small computer manufacturers dealers system integrators and other resellers   manufacturers sales to manufacturers accounted for 54 48 and 55 of the company’s revenues in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively during 2002 the company’s major computer manufacturer customers included dell fujitsu gateway hewlettpackard microsoft nec and trigem occasionally revenues from sales to certain manufacturers account for more than 10 of the company’s revenues in a particular year for example during 2002 sales to dell and hewlettpackard including sales to compaq computer prior to its merger with hewlettpackard in 2002 accounted for 15 and 13 of revenues respectively during 2001 sales to dell and compaq computer accounted for 16 and 12 of revenues respectively during 2000 sales to compaq computer accounted for 21 of revenues the company believes that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve its strong relationships with the leading computer manufacturers since 2000 western digital maxtor which merged with quantum in 2000 and seagate have had the highest market share with these manufacturers   in 2002 the top ten desktop personal computer manufacturers accounted for approximately 52 of all shipments in the desktop pc market as a result maintaining customer satisfaction with these leading computer manufacturers is critical   computer manufacturers evaluate and select their hard drive suppliers based on a number of factors including overall quality storage capacities performance characteristics price service and support ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability they typically seek to qualify two or three providers for each generation of hard drives and once a computer manufacturer has chosen its qualified hard 7 drive vendors for a given product it generally will purchase hard drives from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve success with computer manufacturers’ qualifications a hard drive supplier must consistently offer hard drives featuring leading technology quality and high capacity per disk suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of high quality and reliable hard drives to quickly achieve high volume production a hard drive supplier must have access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities 

  many of the company’s computer manufacturer customers also referred to as original equipment manufacturers or “oems” have adopted justintime inventory management processes or supply chain business models that combine “buildtoorder” computer manufacturer does not build until there is a firm order and “contract manufacturing” computer manufacturer contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the computer manufacturer’s instructions for certain key oems the company maintains a base stock of several weeks on average of current finished goods inventory in facilities located adjacent to the oem’s operations inventory at these locations usually includes minor product customizations such as labeling for the related computer manufacturer if subsequent to its initial order the computer manufacturer changes its requirements inventory held at these facilities can be sold to other computer manufacturers or distributors “as is” or with minor modifications such as a change in labeling at little or no additional cost therefore changes in an oem’s requirements have minimal impact on inventory valuation   for an additional discussion of the need to adapt to customers’ business models and maintain customer satisfaction refer to part ii item 7 under the headings “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” and “risk factors related to western digital particularly”   distributors the company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products to small computer manufacturers resellers dealers and systems integrators the company’s major distributor customers include asi cos distribution ag esys distribution genuine ingram micro and synnex distributors accounted for approximately 39 45 and 38 of disk drive revenues for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements for specific territories with the company for purchase and redistribution of product on a quick turnover basis purchase orders are placed and revised on a weekly basis the company grants certain of its distributors price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis   retailers the company sells its retailpackaged products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores and authorizes sales through distributors to smaller retailers major retailers to whom the company sells directly include best buy circuit city compusa fry’s electronics and sam’s club retailers accounted for approximately 7 of revenues for each of 2002 2001 and 2000 the company’s current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe the retail channel complements the company’s other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for the company and its products retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade” sector in which endusers purchase and install products to upgrade their computers the company grants certain of its retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on an inventory rotation basis the company also sells its retailpackaged products through the internet at its website   the company maintains sales offices throughout north america eastern and western europe the middle east japan and asia pacific field application engineering is provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts and localized enduser technical support services are provided within the united states canada and europe the company’s localized enduser technical support is currently supplied by employees through telephone support and via the company’s website   the company’s international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies but do not include sales to us subsidiaries of foreign companies represented 50 47 and 50 of revenues for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs various trade regulations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” 8   for additional information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and significant customer information see notes 1 and 9 respectively of the notes to consolidated financial statements   the company’s marketing and advertising functions are performed both internally and through an outside firm advertising worldwide packaging and marketing materials are targeted to various reseller and enduser segments western digital utilizes both consumer media and to a lesser extent trade publications the company has programs under which qualifying distributors and retailers are reimbursed for certain marketing expenditures western digital also maintains customer relationships by communicating with its resellers and providing endusers with presale and postsale information and support through its website competition   in the desktop hard drive market the company has competed primarily with fujitsu ibm maxtor quantum samsung and seagate over the last two years maxtor acquired the hard drive business of quantum fujitsu exited the desktop hard drive market and ibm exited the 5400 rpm segment of the hard drive market decreasing the number of major competitors in addition ibm announced in april 2002 that it will sell its hard drive business to a joint venture that is controlled by hitachi data systems   the hard drive industry is intensely competitive with hard drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major customers hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality service and support and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies between different customer and market segments the company believes that it is generally competitive in all of these factors   based on quarterly reports published by trendfocus in 2002 and calendar year 2001 the company believes that its market share of the 35inch ide ata market during 2002 increased approximately 6 from approximately 15 to approximately 21 in addition the overall percentage of the desktop market held by maxtor seagate and western digital the top three desktop suppliers during 2002 increased from approximately 74 to approximately 86   the company believes that there are no substantial barriers to entry for competitors to offer competing products therefore the company believes that it cannot differentiate its hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity buffer size or timetomarket accordingly the company also differentiates itself by designing and incorporating into its hard drives desirable product performance attributes focusing on seek time data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics and data recovery in addition the company emphasizes nonproduct related attributes including rapid response with its computer manufacturer and distribution customers rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery production flexibility and timely service and support which contribute to customer satisfaction the company also relies on the strength of the western digital brand name with valueadded resellers and solution providers to whom the company sells its hard drive products directly and indirectly the company believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation and the establishment of strategic relationships have become important factors in the selection of a hard drive particularly within such a rapidly changing technology environment   the desktop hard drive market is characterized by several large competitors and short product life cycles therefore it has traditionally been subject to periods of sustained and severe price competition and factors such as timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality can have a pronounced effect on the success of any particular product   advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than the company’s hard drive products highspeed semiconductor memory could compete with the company’s hard drive products in the future semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic disk drives but currently is not competitive from a cost 9 standpoint flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance than hard drives it has lower “write” performance flash memory could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives 

  for an additional discussion of competition see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” service and warranty   western digital generally warrants its newly manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one to three years from the date of sale the company’s warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive the company has engaged third parties in china and singapore to process and test returned hard drives for the company’s customers in addition the company has contracted with a third party in canada to process returned hard drives and until recently had engaged a third party to perform a similar service in the united states however in july 2002 western digital assumed the processing and testing of hard drives in the united states and terminated the outsourcing of this function to the third party in 2003 the company has engaged third parties in korea and brazil to process and test returned hard drives the company has contracts with third parties to refurbish or repair its products at service facilities located in singapore and germany manufacturing   to be competitive western digital must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs the company strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility and high manufacturing yields while insisting that its suppliers provide highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of western digital’s hard drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key vendor relationships by establishing partner relationships with its strategic component suppliers the company believes it is able to access “bestofclass” manufacturing quality without the substantial capital investment associated with actual vertical integration in addition the company believes that its sourcing strategy currently enables it to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve   hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and extensive testing to ensure reliability the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” environment which demands skill in process engineering and efficient utilization of the “clean room” layout in order to reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing environment the company’s clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells   the company produces hard drives in two plants one in malaysia and one in thailand the company continually evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity sustain and improve quality and decrease manufacturing costs for example in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs the company closed two manufacturing facilities in singapore during 1999 and 2000 and relocated its hard drive production to malaysia during 2002 in response to an increase in demand and in order to capitalize on the local supplier base the company completed the acquisition of a thailand manufacturing facility the company continually evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and reduce manufacturing costs currently the company purchases all of the standard mechanical components and micro controllers for its hard drives from external suppliers   for an additional discussion of manufacturing see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” 10 research and development   the company devotes substantial resources to development of new products and improvement of existing products the company focuses its engineering efforts on coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in order to bring its products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses for continuing operations totaled 1201 1134 and 1507 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively   for a discussion of product development see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” materials and supplies   the principal components currently used in the manufacture of the company’s hard drives are magnetic heads and related head stack assemblies media controllers spindle motors and mechanical parts used in the head disk assembly in addition to custom semiconductor devices the company also uses standard semiconductor components such as logic memory and microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a wide variety of other parts including connectors cables and other interconnect technology   unlike some of its competitors the company acquires all of the components for its products from third party suppliers in general the company tries to have multiple suppliers for each of its component requirements for example the company currently buys giant magnetoresistive heads from alps electric co ltd readrite corporation and sae magnetics ltd media requirements are purchased from several outside vendors including fuji electric company ltd komag showa denko kk and trace storage technology corporation however the company has a volume purchase agreement with komag under this agreement which expires in april 2005 the company is obligated to purchase a substantial percentage of its requirements for hard disk media from komag as long as komag’s prices technology and quality remain competitive in august 2001 komag announced its voluntary filing for chapter 11 reorganization and in july 2002 announced that it had completed its bankruptcy reorganization komag continued its operations during the chapter 11 process komag malaysia a separate subsidiary which did not file chapter 11 is the manufacturing entity which supplies komag’s share of the company’s media requirements   some custom integrated circuits are currently solesourced from stmicroelectronics and ibm the company has a volume purchase agreement with ibm to purchase the major portion of its read channel chips at negotiated quantities and prices because of their custom nature these products require significant designin periods and long lead times there has been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased integration of various separate circuits the company expects this trend to continue in the area of custom integrated circuits for hard drives   for an additional discussion of component supplies see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” backlog   historically a substantial portion of the company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order the company generally negotiates pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product customers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to the company with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date in addition certain of the company’s sales to computer manufacturers are made under justintime delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale instead the company receives a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer and the customer is invoiced upon shipment of the product from the justintime warehouse therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the company’s revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods 11 patents licenses and proprietary information   the company owns numerous patents and has many patent applications in process the company believes that although its patents and patent applications have considerable value the successful manufacturing and marketing of its products depends primarily upon the technical competence and successful training of its personnel accordingly the patents held and applied for do not assure the company’s future success   in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights the company considers elements of its product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential the company believes that its nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of its process technology is an important factor in its success western digital relies upon nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect its proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the company conducts business also may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states   the company relies on certain technology that is licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its products the company believes that it has adequate crosslicenses and other agreements in place in addition to its own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard drive industry   for additional discussion of intellectual property see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” environmental regulation   the company is subject to a variety of regulations in connection with its operations it believes that it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for its operations employees   as of june 28 2002 the company employed a total of 9550 employees worldwide this represents an increase in headcount of approximately 21 since june 29 2001 and an increase of approximately 30 since june 30 2000 the increase is primarily the result of the purchase of a manufacturing facility in thailand during 2002 in response to an increase in unit sales the company employed 1058 employees in the united states 6676 employees in malaysia 1716 employees in thailand 19 employees in singapore and 81 employees at its international sales offices as of june 28 2002   many of the company’s employees are highly skilled and the company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly the company offers employee benefit programs which it believes are at least equivalent to those offered by its competitors despite these programs the company has along with most of its competitors experienced difficulty at times in hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel when the company is unable to hire personnel in the ordinary course of business it uses third parties to help satisfy its personnel needs in addition the company has utilized consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited the company has never experienced a work stoppage none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor organization and the company considers its employee relations to be good 








 item 2 properties   during december 2000 the company relocated its corporate headquarters from irvine california to lake forest california signing a 10year lease agreement for the lake forest facility the lease for the irvine facility expired in january 2001 the company’s corporate headquarters houses management research and development administrative and sales personnel the company leases one facility in san jose california for research and development activities in addition the company currently leases one facility in irvine california which was used in 2002 for research and development activities but which is currently used as a processing center and for light manufacturing the san jose lease expires in july 2006 and the irvine lease expires in september 2010 western digital owns a manufacturing facility in kuala lumpur malaysia and 12 acquired a smaller manufacturing facility in pathumthani thailand in january 2002 the company also leases office space in various other locations throughout the world primarily for sales and technical support 

  the company believes its present facilities are adequate for its current needs although the process of upgrading its facilities to meet technological and market requirements is expected to continue new manufacturing facilities generally can be developed and become operational within approximately nine to eighteen months should the company require such additional facilities   during 2000 the company sold approximately 34 acres of land in irvine california upon which it had previously planned to build a new corporate headquarters for 26 million the approximate cost of the land during 2000 the company also sold its enterprise drive manufacturing facility in tuas singapore for 110 million for a gain of 31 million and its rochester minnesota enterprise research and development facility for 297 million for a loss of 19 million

  selling general and administrative “sga” expense was 1108 1158 and 1270 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in sga expense in 2002 from 2001 of 50 million was primarily due to expense reduction efforts partially offset by higher employee incentive payments the decrease in 2001 from 2000 of 112 million was primarily due to the company’s exit from the scsi hard drive market in 2000 and expense reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations restructuring charges   during 2000 the company initiated restructuring actions to improve operational efficiency and reduce operating expenses these actions primarily consisted of a consolidation of the company’s asian operations and termination of its scsi hard drive product line restructuring charges recorded in connection with these actions totaled 858 million and consisted of severance and outplacement costs the retirement of manufacturing equipment and information systems assets and net lease cancellation costs also recorded in connection with these actions were special charges to cost of revenues of 348 million for vendor settlements incremental warranty and inventory writedowns associated with exiting the scsi hard drive product line interest and other income expense   net interest and other income expense was 14 531 and 49 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively this includes net investment gains of 48 million in 2002 investment writeoffs and related lease contingency accruals of 524 million in 2001 and net investment gains of 148 million in 2000 excluding these nonrecurring items net interest and other expense was 34 07 and 99 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in net expense in 2002 excluding nonrecurring items was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates the decrease in net expense in 2001 excluding nonrecurring items was primarily due to lower interest expense on lower average debt balances resulting from the payment in 2000 of an outstanding term loan of 500 million and redemptions during 2000 and 2001 of the company’s 525 zero coupon convertible debentures   included in 2002’s net investment gains is a 90 million recovery from the sale of the company’s remaining komag investments to a third party these investments were part of the 524 million nonoperating charge recorded to net interest and other expense during 2001 to adjust the carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable from komag and accruals of komag contingent guarantees resulting from komag’s announcement to file for chapter 11 reorganization income tax benefit   the company’s 2002 net income tax benefit of 11 million included a federal income tax refund of 31 million for a loss carryback available as a result of tax legislation enacted during the year during 2001 the company did not record an income tax benefit as no loss carrybacks were available at that time during 2000 the company recorded an income tax benefit of 195 million to adjust its current and deferred tax accruals the accruals were established in prior years primarily for the unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries however due to the significant increase of net operating loss carryforwards and reevaluation of the accruals after the substantial international restructurings in 2000 the company believed the accruals were no longer necessary see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements discontinued operations   during 2002 the company discontinued the operations of new business ventures including connex inc “connex” sanavigator inc “sanavigator” and keen personal media inc “keen” the company sold substantially all of the assets of its connex and sanavigator businesses for a net gain of 245 million and terminated the keen operations these operating losses for the periods reported and the net gain recognized on the sale of connex and sanavigator have been segregated from continuing operations and reported separately on the statements of operations as discontinued operations 18 extraordinary item   during 2002 the company issued 26 million shares of common stock and paid 176

value of its convertible debentures with a book value of 2841 million these redemptions were private individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors as a result of the redemptions the company recognized an extraordinary loss of 01 million in 2002 and extraordinary gains of 224 and 1669 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively see also “new accounting pronouncements” liquidity and capital resources   the company had cash and cash equivalents of 2237 million at june 28 2002 and 1676 million at june 29 2001 net cash provided by continuing operations was 828 million during 2002 as compared to net cash used for continuing operations of 588 million during 2001 this 1416 million improvement in cash provided by continuing operations consists of a 797 million improvement in the company’s net income net of noncash items and a 619 million decrease in cash used to fund working capital requirements these improvements are due to significantly better operating performance by the company including higher sales volume improved cost management and a lower cash conversion cycle   the company’s cash conversion cycle which represents the sum of the number of days sales outstanding “dso” and days inventory outstanding “dio” less days payable outstanding “dpo” was negative 9 days for 2002 a 2 day improvement over the prior year accounts receivable at june 28 2002 was higher than the prior year as a result of higher fourth quarter revenue combined with longer average collection days due to the elimination of certain early payment discount programs however this increase in average collection days was offset by improved inventory turns and longer payment days with suppliers the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased to 76 million at june 28 2002 from 133 million at june 29 2001 as a result of the writeoff of fully reserved accounts receivable balances which management determined to be uncollectable   other uses of cash during 2002 included net capital expenditures of 477 million primarily for normal replacement of existing assets and the purchase of assets for the company’s new manufacturing facility in thailand and 176 million for debenture redemptions other sources of cash during 2002 included 99 million received from the sale of assets 102 million received in connection with stock option and warrant exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and 05 million received by the company’s subsidiary from minority investors   other uses of cash during 2001 included net capital expenditures of 507 million primarily to upgrade the company’s hard drive production capabilities and for normal replacement of existing assets other sources of cash during 2001 included proceeds of 150 million received upon the sale of marketable equity securities 1105 million received upon issuance of 235 million shares of the company stock under the company’s equity facility and 71 million received in connection with the stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases   the company anticipates that capital expenditures in 2003 will not be more than 650 million and will relate to normal replacement of existing assets and expansion of the company’s new thailand facility   discontinued operations provided net cash proceeds of 182 million in 2002 including approximately 367 million net proceeds from asset sales this compares to 395 million in net cash used to fund the operating investing and financing activities of the discontinued operations for 2001   the company has zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due february 18 2018 the “debentures” the debentures are subordinated to all senior debt are redeemable at the option of the company any time after february 18 2003 at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption and at the holder’s option will be redeemed by the company as of february 18 2003 19 february 18 2008 or february 18 2013 or if there is a fundamental change as defined in the debenture documents at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption the payment on those dates with the exception of a fundamental change can be in cash stock or any combination at the company’s option the debentures are convertible into shares of the company’s common stock at the rate of 14935 shares per 1000 principal amount at maturity since issuance of the debentures in 1998 the company has redeemed debentures with a book value of 4359 million and an aggregate principal amount at maturity of 11 billion through the issuance of cash and or common stock these redemptions were private individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors as of june 28 2002 the remaining book value of the debentures was 862 million the aggregate principal amount at maturity was 1935 million and the market value was 830 million based on current forecasts that show the company continuing to generate positive cash flow from operations the company now intends to satisfy the majority if not all of its put obligations in cash instead of common stock accordingly the debentures have been classified as a current liability at june 28 2002 debentures not put to the company in february 2003 if any will be reclassified as longterm debt 

  during 2001 the company entered into a threeyear senior credit facility replacing a previous facility that had matured on march 31 2000 the senior credit facility provides up to 125 million in revolving credit subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation matures on september 20 2003 and is secured by accounts receivable inventory 65 of the stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets at the option of the company borrowings bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin determined by the borrowing base the senior credit facility requires the company to maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number of other covenants as of the date hereof there were no borrowings under the facility however the company has issued a 25 million standby letter of credit under the facility to cirrus logic inc “cirrus” concerning 25 million in disputed accounts payable these disputed accounts payable have been recorded in the company’s financial statements but are part of the company’s litigation against cirrus see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements the availability under the senior credit facility has been reduced by a corresponding amount of the outstanding letter of credit   during 2001 and 2000 respectively the company issued 235 and 246 million shares of common stock under preexisting shelf registrations for net cash proceeds of 1105 and 1118 million during 2002 no common stock was issued under these shelf registrations and the company withdrew them as management determined they would not be utilized in the foreseeable future   at june 28 2002 the company had cash and cash equivalents of 2237 million working capital of 348 million net of the debentures and shareholders’ equity of 1029 million in addition the company has a senior credit facility providing up to 125 million in revolving credit subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents and its existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that the senior credit facility will continue to be available to the company also the company’s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the headings “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” and “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” commitments   the following is a summary of the company’s significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at june 28 2002 convertible debentures   the company has zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due february 18 2018 the “debentures” for a description of the debentures see the discussion under “liquidity and capital resources” 20 operating leases   the company leases certain facilities and equipment under longterm noncancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through 2010 the following table summarizes the future payments of these leases in thousands  purchase orders   in the normal course of business to reduce the risk of component shortages the company enters into purchase commitments with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture the company’s products these commitments generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter become payable upon receipt of the components and may be noncancelable cancellation charges may be significant the company’s relationship with suppliers allows for some flexibility within these commitments and quantities are subject to change as a quarter progresses and the company’s needs change forward exchange contracts   although the majority of the company’s transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the company does not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes as of june 28 2002 the company had 50 million outstanding of purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts the contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed three months at june 28 2002 the carrying value of the contracts approximates fair value critical accounting policies   the preceding discussion and analysis of the company’s results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of the financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities the company has adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates following are the company’s most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve management’s judgment and estimates if these estimates differ materially from actual results the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material revenue and accounts receivable   in accordance with standard industry practice the company has agreements with resellers that provide price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions in addition the company may have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation on slowmoving items and other incentive programs in accordance with current accounting standards the company recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a corresponding adjustment for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers adjustments are based on 21 anticipated price decreases estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers estimated future returns as well as historical pricing information 

  the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency disputes or other collection issues in addition the company routinely analyzes the different receivable aging categories and establishes reserves based on the length of time receivables are past due   the company records provisions against revenue and cost of revenues for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenues are recognized the company bases these provisions on existing product return notifications as well as historical returns by product type see “warranty” warranty   the company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized warranty covers cost of repair or replacement of the hard drive and the warranty periods range from one to three years the company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty which include specific detail on hard drives in the field by product type historical field return rates and costs to repair inventory   inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout basis or net realizable value inventory writedowns are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions estimates of future sales prices inventory costs and inventory balances   the company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog estimated demand inventory on hand sales levels and other information the company writes down inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis litigation and other contingencies   the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies accordingly the company accrues loss contingencies when management in consultation with its legal advisors concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable deferred tax assets   the company’s deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are fully reserved due to management’s determination that it is “more likely than not” that these assets will not be realized this determination is based on the weight of available evidence the most significant of which is the company’s loss history in the related tax jurisdictions should this determination change in the future some amount of deferred tax assets could be recognized resulting in a tax benefit or a reduction of future tax expense new accounting pronouncements   during april 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” “sfas 145” sfas 145 rescinds sfas 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item the company will adopt sfas 145 on june 29 2002 at which time it will begin classifying gains and losses resulting from the extinguishment of debt as other income and expense instead of extraordinary items the adoption will not have a net impact on the company’s results of operations or liquidity   on september 11 2002 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on issue no 0215 “determining whether certain conversions of convertible debt to equity securities are within 22 the scope of fasb statement no 84 induced conversions of convertible debt” “fas 84” the eitf deliberated this issue because of diversity in practice in the accounting for conversions of convertible debt to equity initiated by the debt holder in practice some registrants accounted for these transactions following fas 84 while others followed accounting principles board opinion no 26 “early extinguishment of debt” “apb 26” the eitf concluded that fas 84 applies to conversions of convertible debt when the offer for consideration in excess of the original conversion terms was made by the bondholder the eitf concluded that this guidance should be followed for transactions entered into on or after september 12 2002 the company’s previous extinguishments of its convertible debentures involving the issuance of stock have been accounted for under apb 26 whereby a gain on early extinguishment was recorded equal to the excess of the net book value of the indebtedness over the fair value of the consideration paid to extinguish the indebtedness following the guidance in eitf issue no 0215 similar early extinguishments of the convertible debentures involving stock initiated by the debt holder will give rise to a conversion inducement expense equal to the fair value of the shares issued in excess of those required to be issued upon the exercise of the debenture conversion feature the company does not expect eitf issue no 0215 to have a significant impact on the future results of operations because the company does not expect to use stock to make early extinguishments of its convertible debentures

   new products require higher areal densities the gigabyte of storage per disk than previous product generations posing formidable technical challenges higher areal densities require fewer heads and disks to achieve a given drive capacity which means that existing head technology must be improved to accommodate more data on a single disk our failure to bring these new products to market on time and at acceptable costs would put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results 

 

   over the past few years hard drive areal density has increased at a much more rapid pace than previously experienced this has significantly shortened product life cycles since each generation of drives is more cost effective than the previous one shorter product life cycles make it more difficult to recover the cost of product development 

 

   due to short product life cycles and continuously changing products we must regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers to be considered for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with our new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or 23 delay in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume computer manufacturers most of which continue to consolidate their share of the pc market these risks are increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining sales and gross margins on our current generation products 

 

   if one of our competitors were able to implement a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that enables a “stepchange” increase in areal density that permits greater storage of data on a disk it could harm our operating results   advances in magnetic optical semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products if these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity we could be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those products 

 

   we expect that our average selling prices for hard drives will continue to decline increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks and therefore lower component cost because of the competitiveness of the hard drive industry lower costs generally mean lower prices this is true even for those products that are competitive and introduced into the market in a timely manner our average selling prices decline even further when competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share 

 

   the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors taken together result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants for example during the first quarter of 2000 the company lost market share as a result of a product recall similar losses in market share could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market tends to experience periods of excess capacity which typically lead to intense price competition during calendar year 2001 and the first half of calendar year 2002 the industry experienced weak pc demand in the us and other markets if intense price competition occurs as a result of weak demand we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected which could result in lower revenues and gross profits 

 

   over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems especially those systems priced below 1000 although we were late to market with a value line hard drive to serve the lowcost pc market we are now offering such value line products at prices that we view as competitive however if we are not able to continue to offer a competitively priced value line hard drive for the lowcost pc market our share of that market will likely fall which could harm our operating results 24   the pc market is fragmenting into a variety of computing devices and products some of these products such as internet appliances may not contain a hard drive on the other hand many industry analysts expect as do we that as broadcasting and communications are increasingly converted to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics and communication devices will converge and hard drives will be found in many consumer products other than computers for 2002 more than 10 of our unit sales were for consumer products other than computers primarily gaming devices if we are not successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for these emerging markets it will likely harm our operating results 

 

   the use of hard disk drives in the game console market is a fairly recent trend due to the price competitive nature of the hard disk drive industry with selling prices of personal computers being substantially higher than game consoles game manufacturers may not have the ability to either incorporate or continue to incorporate hard disk drives into their overall architecture in addition current price reduction demands from either current or future game console customers may not make hard disk drive integration an attractive market for us or other hard drive manufacturers 

 

   our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense we have lost a number of experienced hard drive engineers over the past two years as a result of the loss of retention value of their employee stock options because of the decrease in price of our common stock and aggressive recruiting of our employees if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key personnel or skilled employees our operating results would likely be harmed risk factors relating to western digital particularly 

 

   a majority of our revenue comes from a few customers for example during 2002 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 58 of revenue these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer or if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs our operating results would likely be harmed for example this occurred with our enterprise hard drive product line early in the third quarter of 2000 and is one of the factors which led to our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market 

 

   because we do not manufacture any of the basic components in our hard drives an extended shortage of required components or the failure of key suppliers to remain in business adjust to market conditions or to meet our quality yield or production requirements could harm us more severely than our competitors some of whom manufacture certain of the components for their hard drives and could significantly harm our operating results a number of the components used by us are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers if a component is in short supply or a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component in addition if a component becomes unavailable we could suffer significant loss of revenue for example we lost revenue in 25 september 1999 when we had to shut down our caviar product line production for approximately two weeks as a result of a faulty power driver chip that was solesourced from a third party supplier 

  to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these components as a result we may have to pay significant cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders as we did in 1998 when we accelerated our transition to magnetoresistive recording head technology and as we did in 2000 as a result of our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market   in april 1999 we entered into a threeyear volume purchase agreement with komag under which we buy a substantial portion of our media components from komag in october 2001 we amended the komag volume purchase agreement to extend the initial term to six years similarly in february 2001 we entered into a twoyear volume purchase agreement with ibm under which we buy a substantial portion of our read channel chips from ibm effective june 2002 we amended the ibm volume purchase agreement to extend the initial term through december 31 2003 these strategic relationships have increased our dependence on each of komag and ibm as a supplier our future operating results may depend substantially on komag’s ability to timely qualify its media components in our new development programs and each of komag’s and ibm’s ability to supply us with these components or chips as the case may be in sufficient volume to meet our production requirements a significant disruption in komag’s ability to manufacture and supply us with media components or ibm’s ability to manufacture and supply us with read channel chips could harm our operating results 

 

   under our business model we do not manufacture any of the component parts used in our hard drives as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our strategic component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers each of which employs variations on technology which can impact for example feasible combinations of heads and media components we are currently engaged in litigation with cirrus which until this year was the sole source of read channel chips for our hard drives as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation our business operations were at risk until another supplier’s read channel chips could be designed into our products similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 

 

   the majority of our manufacturing volume comes from one facility in malaysia during 2002 we acquired a second smaller manufacturing facility in thailand a fire flood earthquake or other disaster condition or event that adversely affects either our malaysia or thailand facility or ability to manufacture could result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results 

 

   the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 the united statesled military response to counter terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of usowned companies such as ours 26 

 

   we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations including    we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward exchange contracts however those contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place which occurred in malaysia during the first quarter of 1999 as a result of the malaysian currency controls we are no longer hedging the malaysian currency risk currently we hedge the thai baht and british pound sterling 

 

   the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders we also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights if we conclude that a claim of infringement is valid we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would likely increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

   our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology despite safeguards to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results 27 

 

   if we do not forecast total quarterly demand accurately it can have a material adverse effect on our quarterly results we typically book and ship a high percentage at times up to 58 of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to match our production plans to customer demands in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including  

 

   we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions key estimates and assumptions for us include  

 

   the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock  28    in addition general economic conditions may cause the stock market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many high technology companies these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies   securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and should any new lawsuits be filed such matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention 

 

   due to the risks described herein in the future we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital expenditures expansion or acquisition activity working capital and research and development we have a credit facility which matures on september 20 2003 if we decide to increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development efforts or if results of operations do not meet our expectations we could require additional debt or equity financing however we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available to us or available on acceptable terms an equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about foreign currency risk   although the majority of the company’s transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose for entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations a majority of the increases or decreases in the company’s local currency operating expenses are offset by gains and losses on the hedges the contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed three months the company does not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes   historically the company has focused on hedging its foreign currency risk related to the singapore dollar the british pound sterling and the malaysian ringgit with the establishment of currency controls and the prohibition of purchases or sales of the malaysian ringgit by offshore companies the company discontinued hedging its malaysian ringgit currency risk in 1999 future hedging of this currency will depend on currency conditions in malaysia as a result of the closure of the company’s singapore operations in 2000 the company has also discontinued its hedging program related to the singapore dollar during the third quarter of 2002 the company purchased a manufacturing facility in thailand and began hedging the thai baht 29   as of june 28 2002 the company had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts in millions except average contract rate    in 2002 2001 and 2000 total realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to the consolidated financial statements and the carrying value of the contracts approximated fair value based on historical experience the company does not expect that a significant change in foreign exchange rates would materially affect the company’s consolidated financial statements disclosure about other market risks   fixed interest rate risk   at june 28 2002 the market value of the company’s 525 zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due in 2018 was approximately 830 million compared to the related book value of 862 million the convertible debentures will be repurchased by the company at the option of the holder as of february 18 2003 february 18 2008 or february 18 2013 or if there is a fundamental change as defined in the debenture documents at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption the payment on those dates with the exception of a fundamental change can be in cash stock or any combination at the company’s option   variable interest rate risk   at the option of the company borrowings under the senior credit facility would bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin determined by the borrowing base this is the only debt which does not have a fixedrate of interest at june 28 2002 there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility   fair value risk   the company owns approximately 10 million shares of vixel common stock as of june 28 2002 the market value of the vixel shares was 26 million changes in the market value of the vixel shares are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in other comprehensive income shareholders’ equity as of june 28 2002 a 26 million total accumulated unrealized gain has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income if the company sells any portion of this common stock the related unrealized gain or loss on the date of sale will become realized and reflected as a gain or loss in the company’s income statement as a result of market conditions the market value of the shares had declined from 26 million as of june 28 2002 to 15 million as of september 20 2002 due to market fluctuations an additional decline in the stock’s fair market value could occur 30

 item 1 business 

general   western digital corporation the “company” or “western digital” operates as the parent company of western digital technologies inc “wdt” and other subsidiaries wdt designs develops manufactures and markets hard drives the company’s core business featuring leadingedge technology a hard drive is a storage device found in most computers that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks that provide fast access to data that must be readily available to users of computers or other devices the company’s hard drives are used in desktop pc’s entry level servers network attached storage devices video game consoles digital video recording devices digital cable settop boxes satellite television boxes and audiovisual juke boxes the company’s hard drive products currently include 10inch high 35inch form factor drives with capacities ranging from 8 gigabytes “gb” to 100 gb rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 revolutions per minute “rpm” and the enhanced integrated drive electronics “eide” interface the company sells its products worldwide to computer manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems or subsystems and to distributors resellers and retailers the company’s hard drive products are currently manufactured in malaysia in january 2000 the company announced its decision to cease production of small computer system interface “scsi” hard drives and closed its rochester minnesota hard drive design center   the company continuously evaluates opportunities to apply its data storage core competencies to emerging markets and to expand beyond the traditional market for hard drives through new business ventures and market areas which meet certain predefined criteria in february 1999 the company acquired connex inc “connex” a san josebased startup company that designed network attached storage products during 2001 the company formed sanavigator inc “sanavigator” to develop and market storage area network “san” management subsequent to june 29 2001 the company sold substantially all of the assets of connex and sanavigator and accordingly discontinued these operations   in february 2000 the company formed sagetree inc “sagetree” to design and market packaged analytical software and related services for supply chain and product life cycle applications in june 2000 sagetree received a direct investment from ncr corporation in exchange for a minority interest in sagetree for further discussion of sagetree see under the heading “products — products developed by sagetree” and part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly”   in february 2000 the company also formed cameo technologies inc “cameo” to develop and market technologies and services for delivering highquality digital video content to pc users cameo entered into an agreement with universal pictures in june 2001 to deliver universal’s promotional materials to connected pc users for further discussion of cameo see under the heading “products — products developed by cameo technologies” and part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly”   in october 2000 the company formed keen personal media inc “keen pm” to develop and market interactive personal video recorder and settop box software services and hardware for broadband television content management and commerce keen pm entered into a joint development agreement during october 2000 to develop and license its digital video recorder storage management subsystem software to scientificatlanta for further discussion of keen pm see under the heading “products — products developed by keen pm” and part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly”   the company monitors the development of new markets related to data or content storage and storage management and communication of digital content and network intelligence and may from time to time offer new products or services to address appropriate new markets conversely depending on the development of such markets and the company’s ability to achieve its goals the company may from time to time withdraw from certain markets 3 industry   desktop pc market according to international data corporation “idc” the desktop computer segment is the largest segment of the worldwide personal computer market accounting for approximately 79 of global personal computer shipments in calendar 2000 as a result desktop computers were the leading source of demand for hard drives accounting for more than 74 of all hard drive units shipped worldwide in calendar 2000 according to idc over 90 of western digital’s hard drive unit shipments in 2001 were sold to this market desktop personal computers for entry level to experienced users are used in both commercial and consumer environments the demand for hard drive capacity continues to grow in part due to    future demand growth for desktop computer hard drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard drive markets in september 2001 idc forecasted that the worldwide desktop pc hard drive market would grow from approximately 139 million units in calendar 2001 to 193 million units in calendar 2005 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 85 revenue growth is expected to be lower due to the impact of severe price competition however in august 2001 idc forecasted that the nondesktop pc hard drive market would grow from approximately 11 million units in calendar 2000 to 372 million units in calendar 2004 reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 120 see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate”   desktop pcs are used in a number of environments ranging from homes to businesses and multiuser networks software applications are used on desktop pcs primarily for word processing spreadsheet desktop publishing database management multimedia entertainment and other related applications desktop pcs typically utilize the eide interface for hard drives the company believes the minimum storage requirement in the past year for entrylevel pcs was generally 10 gb to 20 gb of formatted capacity   the industry continues to supply increased capacity per unit as users’ system needs increase and technological and manufacturing advances continue to make higher capacity drives more affordable in the mainstream desktop pc market the company believes that the rate of increase in storage capacity per unit has recently outpaced the rate of increase in demand for such capacity this will result in the company changing its product mix with an increasing percentage of lower capacity hard drives manufactured with fewer heads and disks per unit the company believes that even though unit demand will increase this changing product mix will reduce the average selling price per hard drive unit in the desktop pc market in contrast the emerging use of hard drives to record and play back audio and video content in the audiovisual market is expected to create demand for storage capacity that will exceed the growth in demand for increased capacity in the desktop pc market overall industry sources believe that the current rate of increase in storage capacity per unit shipped will continue for the foreseeable future accordingly the company believes that timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality leadership with higher capacity drives at attractive price levels will continue to be critical to its future success in serving this market   users of desktop pcs especially entrylevel desktop pcs have become increasingly price sensitive in 1999 the market for desktop pc’s priced below 1000 grew significantly and in 2000 the market for desktop pc’s priced below 800 was the fastest growing segment of the market data for 2001 indicates that during the latter part of 2001 the growth in sales of entrylevel pcs had abated these systems typically do not contain high performance hard drives but the growth of these segments in 1999 and 2000 has placed downward price pressure on higher cost systems as well thereby contributing to the increasing price pressures on desktop hard 4 drives see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” 

  emerging audiovisual markets audiovisual content stored for entertainment has historically been stored on removable media such as compact disks “cds” digital video disks “dvds” and videotape these media have also been used to transport and deliver content the emergence of broadband communications as a means of delivering digital content makes it unnecessary to use the removable media itself for delivery this allows hard drives to become the storage media for this digital audiovisual content as it is delivered through broadband communications this has led to the use of hard drives in products for consumer broadband communications networks such as cable and satellite networks audiovisual applications such as digital video recording devices represent a developing market opportunity for the company’s hard drive technologies hard drive technology makes it possible to simultaneously record and play back content to pause and skip forward and backward during live broadcasts and to rapidly access large amounts of audiovisual content   because the market for audiovisual products has not yet developed it is too early to project the likely size and growth of such market for further discussion of this product development effort see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” products   the company’s wd caviar® and wd protege tm hard drive products are designed to serve the advanced and value portions respectively of the desktop pc market entry level server markets and game console markets and its wd performer tm hard drive products are designed to serve the emerging audiovisual portion of the hard drive market   desktop pc and entrylevel server hard drive products the wd caviar and wd protege families currently consists of 10” high 35inch form factor products with capacities ranging from 8 gb to 100 gb and rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 rpm in 1998 the company introduced the data lifeguard tm feature an exclusive data reliability feature which is now implemented in all of the company’s hard drives data lifeguard protects enduser data by automatically detecting isolating and repairing possible problem areas on the hard drive before data loss can occur these products utilize the eide interface providing high performance while retaining ease of use and overall low cost of connection the type of eide interface currently used in substantially all of the company’s hard drives is ata100 which signifies an internal data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second almost twice as fast as the previous generation of eide interface the company also sells a line of hard drives and related adapters which are designed to accommodate an interface known as “1394 firewire ilink” for use primarily in connecting digital consumer electronic devices such as digital video camcorders   the western digital product line generally leverages a common architecture or “platform” for various products with different capacities to serve the differing market needs this platform strategy results in commonality of components across different products which reduces exposure to changes in demand facilitates inventory management and allows the company to achieve lower costs through economies of scale purchasing this platform strategy also enables computer manufacturer customers to leverage their qualification efforts onto successive product models the company expects to continue to utilize this platform strategy as it develops products for the emerging market for hard drives specifically designed for audiovisual applications such as new digital video recording devices   audiovisual hard drive products the company offers customized design capabilities and unique hard drive technologies for consumer applications however where practical the company intends to leverage its existing product line architectures for the various products for the audiovisual market the company is currently offering the wd performer tm hard drive product line designed for use in consumer audiovideo applications it is also developing hard drives and products incorporating hard drive technology for consumer electronics products including digital cable settop boxes satellite television boxes audiovisual jukeboxes and video game consoles 5   products developed by keen pm keen pm is a broadband products and services

postimplementation support technology and product development   hard drives are used to record store and retrieve digital data their performance attributes are currently better than removable or floppy disks optical disk drives and tape and they are more cost effective than semiconductor technology the primary measures of hard drive performance include    all of the company’s hard drive products employ similar technology the main components of the hard drive are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board the head disk assembly includes the head media disks head positioning mechanism actuator and spin motor these components are contained in a hard base plate protective package in a contaminationfree environment the printed circuit board includes custom integrated circuits an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector   the head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spin motor disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied each disk has a head suspended directly above it which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk the sensor element of the head also known as the slider is getting progressively smaller resulting in reduced material costs   the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller the drive interface receives instructions from the computer while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the heads the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in concentric 6 tracks which are divided into sectors the computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from or write data to the disks based on track and sector locations guided by instructions from the controller the head stack assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved 

  industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer currently the primary interface for desktop pcs is eide increasingly work station computers are using the eide interface as well as computer performance continues to improve the hard drive will need to deliver information faster than this interface can handle accordingly the desktop pc industry plans to transition to higher speed interfaces to handle the higher data transfer rates the company is working to develop products that will support these higher speed interfaces   storage capacity of the hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density which is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk areal density is generally measured in megabits per square inch of disk surface the higher the areal density the more information can be stored on a single platter as the areal density increases fewer disks andor heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity thus reducing product costs through reduced component requirements   head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density the desktop hard drive industry has completed a transition to magnetoresistive head technology which allows significantly higher storage capacities than the previously utilized thinfilm head technology magnetoresistive heads have discrete read and write structures which provide more signal than the older thinfilm inductive heads this allows significantly higher areal densities which increases storage capacity per disk and improves manufacturing margin and product reliability the company completed the transition to magnetoresistive head technology in 1999 and in 2000 completed the transition to the next generation of head technology known as giant magnetoresistive and currently all of the company’s hard drive product offerings employ giant magnetoresistive head technology   constant innovations in research and development are essential to the company’s ability to compete hard drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of technological innovations designed to further increase hard drive performance and reduce product costs including simplifying the electronic architecture by combining the traditional controller channel microprocessor and servointerface management functions of traditional hard drive microprocessors on a single integrated circuit moreover to consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume production of new products some hard drive providers are striving to simplify their product design processes by focusing on creating extendible core technology platforms which utilize common firmware and mechanical designs and reuse of manufacturing tooling and application specific integrated circuits across various product generations and product lines sales and distribution   the company sells its products globally to computer manufacturers distributors valueadded resellers dealers system integrators retailers and internetbased retailers manufacturers typically purchase components such as hard drives and assemble them into the computer systems they build distributors typically sell the company’s drives to small manufacturers dealers system integrators and other resellers   manufacturers sales to manufacturers accounted for 70 65 and 59 of consolidated revenues in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the company’s major computer manufacturer customers include apple computer compaq computer dell computer fujitsu gateway hewlettpackard ibm intel micron electronics and nec during both 1999 and 2000 sales to compaq accounted for 21 of revenues during 2001 sales to compaq and to dell accounted for 12 and 17 of revenues respectively the company believes that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve its strong relationships with the leading 7 computer manufacturers western digital quantum maxtor and seagate have historically had the highest market share with these manufacturers during 2001 maxtor acquired the hard drive business of quantum however the remaining number of qualified suppliers to the leading manufacturers combined with the continued growth of the sub1000 pc market and a recent economic slowdown has placed continuous downward pressure on hard drive prices this pressure in turn has reduced average gross margins for hard drive suppliers 

  the leading pc computer manufacturers have been gaining market share which has increased their purchasing leverage over component suppliers in calendar year 2000 the top ten desktop personal computer manufacturers accounted for more than 58 of all shipments and a significant amount of the growth in the desktop pc market as a result maintaining customer satisfaction with these leading computer manufacturers has become even more critical   computer manufacturers typically seek to qualify up to three or four providers for each generation of hard drives once a computer manufacturer has chosen its qualified hard drive vendors for a given product it generally will purchase hard drives from those vendors for the life of that product to achieve consistent success with computer manufacturers’ qualifications a hard drive supplier must be an early provider of next generation hard drives featuring leading technology and high capacity per disk suppliers must quickly achieve volume production of high quality and reliable hard drives to quickly achieve high volume production a hard drive supplier must have access to flexible highcapacity highquality manufacturing capabilities factors on which computer manufacturers evaluate their hard drive suppliers include overall quality storage capacities performance characteristics price ease of doing business and the supplier’s longterm financial stability   the business models of computer manufacturers have been changing and these changes have impacted and will continue to impact western digital’s sales inventory and distribution patterns most of the computer industry has used a forecastdriven longproductionrun logistics model this model limits the computer manufacturers’ flexibility to react to rapid technology changes and component pricing fluctuations some of the company’s customers have implemented a supply chain logistics model that combines “buildtoorder” computer manufacturer does not build until there is an order backlog and “contract manufacturing” computer manufacturer contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the computer manufacturer’s instructions the company has adapted its logistics model to effectively align with these industry shifts these changes require greater skill in managing finished goods inventory and more flexibility in manufacturing both of which in turn require even closer relationships between the company and its computer manufacturer and contract manufacturer customers to help meet these challenges the company is expanding its use of internet technology and webbased supply chain planning tools   for an additional discussion of the changes in customer models refer to part ii item 7 under the headings “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” and “risk factors related to western digital particularly”   the company maintains a base stock of two to three weeks of current finished goods inventory for certain key computer manufacturer customers in facilities located adjacent to their operations inventory at these locations usually includes minor product customizations such as labeling for the related computer manufacturer if subsequent to its initial order the computer manufacturer changes its requirements inventory held at these facilities can be sold to other computer manufacturers or distributors as is or with minor modifications such as a change in labeling at little or no additional cost therefore these arrangements even if not fulfilled have minimal impact on inventory valuation   distributors the company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products to small computer manufacturers valueadded resellers resellers and systems integrators the company’s major distributor customers include asi decision support systems eld ingram micro merisel servex synnex and tech data distributors and retailers combined accounted for approximately 30 35 and 41 of disk drive revenue for 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively distributors generally enter into nonexclusive agreements with 8 the company for purchase and redistribution of product on a quick turnover basis purchase orders are placed and revised on a weekly basis the company grants certain of its distributors price protection and limited rights to return product on a rotation basis 

  retailers the company sells its retailpackaged products directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores and authorizes sales through distributors to smaller retailers major retailers to whom the company sells directly include best buy circuit city compusa office depot vobis and fry’s electronics retailers accounted for approximately 6 5 and 6 of revenue for 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the company’s current retail customer base is primarily in the united states canada and europe the retail channel complements the company’s other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for the company and its products retailers supply the aftermarket “upgrade” sector in which endusers purchase and install products to upgrade their computers the company grants certain of its retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on a rotation basis the company also sells its retailpackaged products through the internet at its website httpwwwwesterndigitalcom   the company maintains sales offices throughout north america eastern and western europe the middle east japan and southeast asia field application engineering is provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts and enduser technical support services are provided within the united states and europe the company’s enduser technical support is supplied by both employees and qualified thirdparty support organizations through telephone support during business hours and via the company’s website   the company’s international sales which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of us companies represented 45 53 and 41 of revenues for fiscal years 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively sales to international customers may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations including exposure to tariffs various trade regulations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly”   for information concerning revenue recognition sales by geographic region and significant customer information see notes 1 and 9 respectively of notes to consolidated financial statements   the company’s marketing and advertising functions are performed both internally and through outside firms advertising direct marketing worldwide packaging and marketing materials are targeted to various enduser segments western digital utilizes both consumer media and trade publications the company has programs under which qualifying manufacturers and resellers are reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures western digital also invests in direct marketing and customer satisfaction programs the company maintains ongoing contact with end users through primary and secondary market research focus groups product registrations and technical support databases competition   in the desktop hard drive market the company has competed primarily with fujitsu ibm maxtor quantum samsung and seagate during the last year maxtor acquired the hard drive business of quantum and recently fujitsu announced that it would exit the desktop hard drive market decreasing the number of major competitors   the hard drive industry is intensely competitive with hard drive suppliers competing for a limited number of major customers hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical form fit and function standards hard drive manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and reliability storage capacity unit price product performance production volume capabilities delivery capability leadership in timetomarket timetovolume and timetoquality and ease of doing business the relative importance of these factors varies among different customer and market segments the company believes that it is generally competitive in all of these factors   the company believes that it cannot differentiate its hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage capacity therefore the company also differentiates itself by designing and incorporating into its hard drives desirable product performance attributes and by emphasizing rapid response with its computer 9 manufacturer and distribution customers and brand equity with its end users these product performance attributes include seek time data transfer rates intelligent caching failure prediction remote diagnostics acoustics and data recovery rapid response requires accelerated design cycles customer delivery and production flexibility which contribute to customer satisfaction data storage has become strategically critical for computer end users consequently the company believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation has become an important factor in the selection of a hard drive particularly within such a rapidly changing technology environment the company believes it has strong brand equity with its end users 

  the company completed its transition to magnetoresistive technology in 1999 and completed its transition to giant magnetoresistive technology in 2000 during the first quarter of 2000 the company lost market share as a result of a product recall however the company recovered some of its market share as it regained a leadership position in quality and timetomarket during the remainder of 2000 and continued to regain market share during 2001   the desktop hard drive market is characterized by many competitors and short product life cycles therefore it has traditionally been subject to periods of sustained and severe price competition and factors such as timetomarket can have a pronounced effect on the success of any particular product   advances in magnetic optical or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than the company’s hard drive products highspeed semiconductor memory could compete with the company’s hard drive products in the future semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic disk drives but currently is volatile ie subject to loss of data in the event of power failure and much more costly flash memory a nonvolatile semiconductor memory is currently much more costly and while it has higher “read” performance than hard drives it has lower “write” performance flash memory could become competitive in the near future for applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided by hard drives   for an additional discussion of competition see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” service and warranty   western digital generally warrants its newly manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one to three years from the date of sale the company’s warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive the company has contracted with a third party in the united states to process and test returned hard drives for the company’s end users the company refurbishes or repairs its products at thirdparty service facilities located in singapore and germany manufacturing   to be competitive western digital must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading timetovolume production at competitive unit costs the company strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility high manufacturing yields and highquality components at competitive prices the critical elements of western digital’s hard drive production are high volume low cost assembly and testing and establishment and maintenance of key vendor relationships in order to create “virtual vertical integration” by establishing partner relationships with its strategic component suppliers the company believes it is able to access “bestofclass” manufacturing quality without the substantial capital investment associated with actual vertical integration in addition the company believes that its virtual vertical integration model enables it to have the business flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve   hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and extensive testing to ensure reliability the assembly process occurs in a “clean room” 10 environment which demands skill in process engineering and efficient utilization of the “clean room” layout in order to reduce the high operating costs of this manufacturing environment the company’s clean room manufacturing process consists of modular production units each of which contains a number of work cells with increased areal density requirements of new products introduced the ability to achieve historically high yields has decreased 

  the company produces hard drives in one plant in malaysia as a continuation of its virtual vertical integration model the company sold its media manufacturing division in 1999 to komag inc “komag” with the sale of this division the company now purchases all of the standard mechanical components and micro controllers for its hard drives from external suppliers   the company continually evaluates its manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity and decrease manufacturing costs in order to address inventory oversupply the company reduced excess manufacturing capacity by closing two manufacturing facilities in singapore during 1999 and 2000 and relocating its hard drive production to malaysia the company continually evaluates which steps in the manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how automated manufacturing processes support the company’s business plans   for an additional discussion of manufacturing see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” research and development   the company devotes substantial resources to development of new products and improvement of existing products the company focuses its engineering efforts on coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in order to bring its products to market in a costeffective and timely manner research and development expenses for continuing operations totaled 1984 1507 and 1225 million in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the decreases from 1999 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2001 were due to the company’s exit from scsi hard drive production during 2000 and expense reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations partially offset by increased spending in the company’s developing new business ventures   for a discussion of product development see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” materials and supplies   the principal components currently used in the manufacture of the company’s hard drives are magnetic heads and related head stack assemblies media controllers spindle motors and mechanical parts used in the headdisk assembly in addition to its own proprietary semiconductor devices the company also uses standard semiconductor components such as logic memory and microprocessor devices obtained from other manufacturers and a wide variety of other parts including connectors cables and other interconnect technology   unlike some of its competitors the company acquires all of the components for its products from thirdparty suppliers in general the company tries to have at least three suppliers for each of its component requirements for example the company currently buys giant magnetoresistive heads from ibm readrite and sae media requirements are purchased from several outside vendors including komag fuji trace and showa in connection with the sale of its media manufacturing division to komag in april 1999 the company entered into a volume purchase agreement with komag under this agreement which expires in april 2002 the company is obligated to purchase a substantial percentage of its requirements for hard disk media from komag as long as komag’s prices technology and quality remain competitive subsequent to june 29 2001 komag announced the voluntary filing for chapter 11 reorganization komag further announced that it expects to continue its operations during the chapter 11 process komag malaysia a separate subsidiary which did not file chapter 11 is the manufacturing entity which supplies the company’s media the company is in discussions with komag concerning an extension of the agreement beyond its april 2002 expiration date 11   some custom integrated circuits are currently solesourced from stmicroelectronics because of their custom nature these products require significant designin periods and long lead times there has been a trend in integrated circuit design toward increased integration of various separate circuits the company expects this trend to continue in the area of custom integrated circuits for hard drives   for an additional discussion of component supplies see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” backlog   at august 24 2001 the company’s backlog consisting of orders scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately 287 million compared with a backlog at september 18 2000 of approximately 294 million the company expects this entire backlog to be delivered within the current fiscal year historically a substantial portion of the company’s orders has been for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the placement of the order the company generally negotiates pricing order lead times product support requirements and other terms and conditions prior to receiving a computer manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product manufacturers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to the company with little or no cost to the customer or modified by customers to provide for delivery at a later date also certain of the company’s sales to computer manufacturers are made under “justintime” delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order commitments by the customer until the time of sale therefore backlog information as of the end of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels of the company’s revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier periods patents licenses and proprietary information   the company owns numerous patents and has many patent applications in process the company believes that although its patents and patent applications have significant value the successful manufacturing and marketing of its products depends primarily upon the technical competence and creative ability of its personnel accordingly the patents held and applied for do not assure the company’s future success   in addition to patent protection of certain intellectual property rights the company considers elements of its product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential the company believes that its nonpatented intellectual property particularly some of its process technology is an important factor in its success western digital relies upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and a system of internal safeguards to protect its proprietary information despite these safeguards there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the company does business also may provide less protection for confidential information than the united states   the company relies on certain technology that is licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its products the company has crosslicensing agreements with several competitors customers and suppliers and the company believes that it has adequate licenses and other agreements in place in addition to its own intellectual property portfolio to compete successfully in the hard drive industry   for additional discussion of intellectual property see part ii item 7 under the heading “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” environmental regulation   the company is subject to a variety of regulations in connection with its operations it believes that it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary permits for its domestic operations employees   as of june 29 2001 the company employed a total of 7909 fulltime employees worldwide this represents an increase in headcount of approximately 8 since june 30 2000 and a reduction of approximately 25 since july 3 1999 as the company responded to the industry downturn and its decrease in sales by restructuring its hard drive business during 1999 and 2000 the company employed 1174 employees in the 12 united states 6630 employees in malaysia 27 employees in singapore and 78 employees at its international sales offices as of june 29 2001 

  many of the company’s employees are highly skilled and the company’s continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees accordingly the company offers employee benefit programs which it believes are at least equivalent to those offered by its competitors despite these programs the company has along with most of its competitors experienced difficulty at times in hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel in critical areas the company has utilized consultants and contract personnel to fill these needs until fulltime employees could be recruited the company has never experienced a work stoppage none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor organization and the company considers its employee relations to be good 










 item 2 properties   during december 2000 the company relocated its corporate headquarters from irvine california to lake forest california signing a 10year lease agreement for the lake forest facility the lease for the irvine facility expired in january 2001 the company’s corporate headquarters houses management research and development administrative and sales personnel the company leases one facility in san jose california and one facility in irvine california for research and development and new venture activities the san jose lease expires in july 2006 and the irvine research and development facility lease expires in september 2010 western digital owns a manufacturing facility in kuala lumpur malaysia the company also leases office space in various other locations throughout the world primarily for sales and technical support   the company’s present facilities are adequate for its current needs although the process of upgrading its facilities to meet technological and market requirements is expected to continue the hard drive industry does not generally require long lead time to develop and begin operations in new manufacturing facilities   during 2000 the company sold approximately 34 acres of land in irvine california upon which it had previously planned to build a new corporate headquarters for 26 million the approximate cost of the land the company also sold its enterprise drive manufacturing facility in tuas singapore for 110 million for a gain of 31 million and its rochester minnesota enterprise research and development facility for 297 million for a loss of 19 million

  the company continuously evaluates opportunities to apply its data storage core competencies to emerging markets and to expand beyond traditional markets for hard drives through new business ventures meeting certain predefined criteria the company’s new business ventures have included connex inc “connex” sanavigator inc “sanavigator” sagetree inc “sagetree” keen personal media inc “keen pm” and cameo technologies inc “cameo” subsequent to june 29 2001 the company discontinued the operations of both connex and sanavigator selling substantially all the assets of the two companies the company’s other new businesses have not yet generated significant revenue and the company continues to evaluate their progress results of operations summary of 1999 2000 and 2001 comparison   the following table sets forth for the periods indicated items in the company’s statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenue this table and the following discussion exclude the results of the discontinued connex and sanavigator businesses    the company reported losses from continuing operations of 4725 3295 and 871 million in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the 1999 loss included charges of approximately 770 million for incremental thinfilm warranty provisions approximately 75 million in malaysian currency losses and restructuring charges of 610 million for the consolidation of the company’s personal storage and enterprise storage divisions and the sale of its media operation the 2000 loss included net restructuring charges totaling 858 million for the closure of the company’s singapore operations and scsi hard drive operations the 2000 loss also included charges to cost of revenues of 348 million for vendor settlements incremental warranty and inventory writedowns associated with exiting the scsi hard drive product line and 377 million for costs to repair recalled drives the 2001 loss included nonoperating charges of 524 million to adjust the carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable from komag inc “komag” and accruals of contingent guarantees excluding the aforementioned restructuring and other charges losses from continuing operations were 3270 1712 and 347 million in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the decrease in losses from 1999 to 2000 excluding restructuring and special charges was due primarily to a 1076 million or 279 decrease in operating expenses and a 208 million decrease in interest and other nonoperating expense the decrease in losses from 2000 to 2001 resulted from a 1256 million increase in gross profit and a 18 361 million decrease in operating expenses partially offset by a 57 million increase in interest and other nonoperating expense 

net revenues   consolidated net revenues of 20 billion in 2000 decreased 08 billion or 293 from 1999 due to the company’s decision in the third quarter of 2000 to cease production of scsi hard drives 1999 revenue included 4350 million for scsi hard drives compared to 1418 million in 2000 a decline in the average selling prices “asp’s” of eide hard drive products due to an intensely competitive market and a decline in eide drive unit shipments of approximately 6 due largely to the product recall in the first quarter of 2000   during the first quarter of 2000 the company announced a recall of its 68gb per platter series of wd caviar® eide hard drives because of a reliability problem resulting from a faulty power driver chip manufactured by a thirdparty supplier as a result revenues of approximately 100 million were reversed and production was shut down for approximately two weeks eliminating approximately 70 million of forecasted revenue   consolidated net revenues in 2001 were flat with 2000 at approximately 20 billion excluding the revenue from scsi drive sales in 2000 revenue increased 1380 million or 76 in 2001 this improvement was due to an increase in eide drive unit shipments of approximately 19 offset by a decline in asp’s revenues from new business ventures were not material for the periods presented in 2001 the company adopted staff accounting bulletin 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” which defers the recognition of revenue on sales made under certain shipping terms the implementation of sab 101 resulted in an increase to revenues for 2001 of 131 million gross profit   gross profit loss was 28 million or 01 of revenue in 1999 96 million or 05 of revenue in 2000 and 2077 million or 106 of revenue in 2001 gross profit for 1999 included 770 million of special charges for incremental thinfilm warranty provision related to a change in the estimated lifetime return rate applied to an installed base of products gross profit for 2000 included 725 million of special charges related to exiting the scsi hard drive product line and the product recall excluding special charges gross profit was 742 million or 27 of revenue and 821 million or 42 of revenue for 1999 and 2000 respectively the increase in gross profit from 1999 to 2000 excluding special charges was primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs due to the consolidation of drive production to a single highly utilized facility in malaysia offset by lower volumes and lower asps the increase in gross profit from 2000 to 2001 excluding special charges was the result of higher volume offset by lower asp’s lower manufacturing costs due to 2000 expense reduction efforts and lower warranty costs due to the discontinuance of the scsi hard drive product line in 2000 and the expiration of the warranty period for thinfilm products in 2001 the net impact of sab 101 on gross profit in 2001 was insignificant operating expenses   research and development expense was 1984 1507 and 1225 million for 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the 477 and 281 million decreases from 1999 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2001 respectively were due to the company’s exit from scsi hard drive production during 2000 and expense reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations partially offset by increased spending in the company’s developing new business ventures   selling general and administrative “sga” expense was 1944 1270 and 1191 million for 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the decrease of 674 million from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to the company’s exit from scsi hard drive production expense reductions in its remaining hard drive operations an 110 million accrual reduction in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the nonrecurrence of a 75 million charge on the terminated hedging contracts recorded in 1999 the decrease was partially offset by increased spending in the company’s developing new business ventures the decrease of 79 million from 2000 to 2001 was 19 primarily due to the company’s exit from scsi hard drive production in 2000 and the expense reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations partially offset by increased spending in the company’s developing new business ventures 

interest and other income expense tax benefit and extraordinary item   net interest and other expense income was 159 49 and 532 million in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively the 208 million decrease in expense in 2000 was due to a 148 million gain on the disposition of certain investment securities and to lower interest expense on lower average debt balances resulting from the payment in 2000 of an outstanding term loan of 500 million and redemptions during 2000 of the company’s 525 zero coupon convertible debentures the “debentures” offset by a reduced amount of interest income due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances   during the fourth quarter of 2001 the company recorded nonoperating charges of 524 million to adjust the carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable from komag and accruals of komag contingent guarantees the assets were received as a component of the total consideration from the sale of the company’s disk media operations to komag in 1999 also in conjunction with the sale komag assumed certain liabilities mainly leases related to production equipment and facilities for which the company remained contingently liable due to recent market conditions and the announcement by komag that it would not pay its senior debt when it became due in june and an interest payment on its convertible bonds due in july the company recorded the charges on august 24 2001 komag announced its voluntary chapter 11 reorganization filing   the 581 million increase in net interest and other expense in 2001 was due primarily to the nonrecurring charges related to komag of 524 million a 151 million decrease in gains from the disposition of investment securities and a reduced amount of interest income due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances offset slightly by lower accrued interest expense due to debenture redemptions   the company recorded an income tax benefit of 195 million in 2000 to adjust its current and deferred tax accruals the accruals were previously established over time and primarily related to unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries however due to the significant increase of net operating loss carryforwards in recent years and reevaluation of the accruals after the substantial international restructurings in 2000 the company believed the accruals were no longer necessary in 1999 and 2001 no tax benefit was recorded because additional loss carrybacks were not available and management believed it was “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefits generated would not be realized see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements   during 2000 the company issued 267 million shares of common stock in exchange for 7356 million in face value of its convertible debentures with a book value of 2841 million during 2001 the company issued 160 million shares of common stock in exchange for 2957 million in face value of its convertible debentures with a book value of 1203 million these redemptions were private individually negotiated noncash transactions with certain institutional investors as a result of the redemptions the company recognized extraordinary gains of 1669 million and 224 million in 2000 and 2001 respectively discontinued operations   subsequent to june 29 2001 the company decided to discontinue the operations of connex and sanavigator and sold substantially all of the assets of these two businesses accordingly the operating results of connex and sanavigator have been segregated from continuing operations and reported separately on the statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 20 liquidity and capital resources   the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1840 million at june 30 2000 and 1676 million at june 29 2001 net cash used for continuing operations was 1267 million during 2000 as compared to 713 million during 2001 the decrease in cash used for continuing operations reflects a significant improvement in the company’s operating results net of noncash items offset by a higher level of cash used to fund net operating asset growth the improvement in continuing operating results net of noncash items of 2043 million was due to significantly better performance by the company’s hard drive business as a result of higher sales volume and improved cost management the discontinuance in 2000 of the company’s scsi drive product line and the inclusion in 2000 of significant charges relating to the product recall the improved operating results of the hard drive business were offset somewhat by increased spending on continuing new business ventures cash used to fund net operating asset growth for continuing operations increased in 2001 by 1489 million due primarily to the impact in the prior year of the product recall on net operating assets specifically there was a sharp contraction during 2000 in the company’s cash conversion cycle which represents the sum of the number of days sales outstanding “dso” and days inventory outstanding “dio” less days payable outstanding “dpo” as the following chart indicates the company’s cash conversion cycle was reduced by 17 days during 2000 and another 6 days during 2001    the decrease in the cash conversion cycle from 1999 to 2000 was due primarily to a reduction in dso’s due in large part to the product recall during the first quarter of 2000 and a sustained improvement in the linearity of shipments during the remainder of 2000 the decrease from 2000 to 2001 was due to a reduction in dso’s and dio’s due primarily to improved sales and production linearity offset partially by a slight decrease in dpo’s the company seeks to maintain a negative cash conversion cycle   other uses of cash during 2000 included the repayment of bank debt of 500 million costmethod investments of 129 million and net capital expenditures of 214 million other sources of cash during 2000 included proceeds of 1118 million received upon issuance of 246 million shares of the company’s stock under the company’s equity facility 100 million received by sagetree upon issuance of preferred stock 62 million received in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and 668 million received from sales of real property   other uses of cash during 2001 included net capital expenditures of 507 million primarily to upgrade the company’s hard drive production capabilities and for normal replacement of existing assets other sources of cash during 2001 included proceeds of 150 million received upon the sale of marketable equity securities 1105 million received upon issuance of 235 million shares of the company stock under the company’s equity facility 71 million received in connection with the stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases and 50 million received by keen upon issuance of an investor note   the company anticipates that capital expenditures in 2002 will not be more than 650 million and will relate to normal replacement of existing assets   during 1998 the company issued zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due february 18 2018 the “debentures” the debentures are subordinated to all senior debt are redeemable at the option of the company any time after february 18 2003 at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption and at the holder’s option will be repurchased by the company as of february 18 2003 february 18 2008 or february 18 2013 or if there is a fundamental change as defined in the debenture documents at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of repurchase the payment on those dates with the exception of a fundamental change can be in cash stock or any combination at the 21 company’s option the debentures are convertible into shares of the company’s common stock at the rate of 14935 shares per 1000 principal amount at maturity the principal amount at maturity of the debentures when issued was 13 billion during 2000 the company issued 267 million shares of common stock in exchange for debentures with a book value of 2841 million and an aggregate principal amount at maturity of 7356 million during 2001 the company issued 160 million shares of common stock in exchange for debentures with a book value of 1203 million and an aggregate principal amount at maturity of 2957 million these redemptions were private individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors and resulted in extraordinary gains of 1669 million and 224 million during 2000 and 2001 respectively as of june 29 2001 the book value of the remaining outstanding debentures was 1125 million the aggregate principal amount at maturity was 2659 million and the market value was 851 million 

  during 2001 the company entered into a threeyear senior credit facility for its hard drive business western digital technologies inc “wdt” replacing a previous facility that had matured on march 31 2000 the senior credit facility provides up to 125 million in revolving credit subject to a borrowing base calculation matures on september 20 2003 and is secured by wdt’s accounts receivable inventory 65 of the stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets at the option of wdt borrowings bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin determined by the borrowing base   the senior credit facility requires wdt to maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number of other covenants as of the date hereof there were no borrowings under the facility   under an existing shelf registration statement the “equity facility” the company may issue shares of common stock to institutional investors for cash shares sold under the facility are at the market price of the company’s common stock less a discount ranging from 275 to 425 during 2000 the company issued 246 million shares of common stock under the equity facility for net cash proceeds of 1118 million during 2001 the company issued 235 million shares of common stock under the equity facility for net cash proceeds of 1105 million as of june 29 2001 the company had 1677 million remaining under the equity facility   the company may continue to incur operating losses during 2002 however at june 29 2001 the company had a cash and cash equivalent balance of 1676 million working capital of 454 million and shareholders’ equity of 68 million the company has achieved significant reductions in manufacturing labor and overhead and operating expenses resulting from the sale in late 1999 of the company’s media operations the closure in 2000 of the company’s two singapore based manufacturing facilities and its rochester design center the disposal of its connex and sanavigator businesses and an overall reduction in worldwide headcount in addition the company had the following additional sources of liquidity available as of september 26 2001 1677 million remaining available under the equity facility and a senior credit facility providing up to 125 million in revolving credit subject to a borrowing base calculation   based on the above factors the company believes its current cash and cash equivalent balances and its existing equity and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that the senior credit facility or the equity facility will continue to be available to the company also the company’s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the headings “risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate” and “risk factors relating to western digital particularly” new accounting pronouncements   during july 2001 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” “sfas 141” and statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” effective june 30 2001 the company adopted sfas 141 sfas 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires that all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method the adoption of sfas 141 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 22   sfas 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but rather be tested at least annually for impairment the company is required to adopt sfas 142 on june 29 2002 however goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june 30 2001 are subject to the amortization provisions of sfas 142 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 142 to have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate 

 

   to achieve consistent success with computer manufacturer customers we must be an early provider of next generation hard drives featuring leading technology and high quality if we fail to  then our market share would be adversely affected which would harm our operating results short product life cycles make it difficult to recover the cost of development   over the past few years hard drive areal density the gigabytes of storage per disk has increased at a much more rapid pace than previously experienced the technical challenges of maintaining this pace are becoming more formidable and the risk of not achieving the targets for each new generation of drives increases which could adversely impact product manufacturing yields and schedules among other impacts higher areal densities mean that fewer heads and disks are required to achieve a given drive capacity this has significantly shortened product life cycles since each generation of drives is more cost effective than the previous one shorter product cycles make it more difficult to recover the cost of product development short product life cycles force us to continually qualify new products with our customers   due to short product life cycles we must regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers to be considered for qualification we must be among the leaders in timetomarket with our new products once a product is accepted for qualification testing any failure or delay in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume computer manufacturers most of which continue to consolidate their share of the pc market these risks are magnified because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining sales and gross margins on our current generation products unexpected technology advances in the hard drive industry could harm our competitive position   if one of our competitors were able to implement a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that enables a stepchange increase in areal density allowing greater storage of data on a disk it would harm our operating results   advances in magnetic optical semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products if these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity we could be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those products 23 our average selling prices are declining   we expect that our average selling prices for hard drives will continue to decline rapid increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks and is therefore lower cost because of the competitiveness of the hard drive industry lower costs generally mean lower prices this is true even for those products that are competitive and introduced into the market in a timely manner our average selling prices decline even further when competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity liquidate excess inventories restructure or attempt to gain market share 

 

   the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply cost reductions technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or gain market share in addition rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence these factors taken together result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants for example during 1998 and 1999 we lost significant share of the desktop market during the first quarter of 2000 the company lost market share as a result of a previously announced product recall however we recovered some market share during the remainder of 2000 and during the first half of 2001 but our share is still significantly below its 1997 level 

 

   demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for computer systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems the demand for computer systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period as a result the hard drive market tends to experience periods of excess capacity which typically lead to intense price competition recently several competitor manufacturers and industry analysts have forecasted softening pc demand in the us if intense price competition occurs as a result of softening demand we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected and transition to new products sooner than expected changes in the markets for hard drives require us to develop new products   over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems especially those systems priced below 1000 we were late to market with a value line hard drive to serve that market and we lost market share if we are not able to offer a competitively priced value line hard drive for the lowcost pc market our market share will likely fall which could harm our operating results   the pc market is fragmenting into a variety of computing devices and products some of these products such as internet appliances may not contain a hard drive on the other hand many industry analysts expect as do we that as broadcasting and communications are increasingly converted to digital technology from the older analog technology the technology of computers and consumer electronics and communication devices will converge and hard drives will be found in many consumer products other than computers if we are not successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for these emerging markets it will likely harm our operating results we depend on our key personnel   our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key employees many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense we have lost a number of experienced hard drive engineers over the past two years as a result of the loss of retention value of their employee stock options because of the decrease in price of our common stock and aggressive recruiting of our employees if we are unable to retain our existing employees or hire and integrate new employees our operating results would likely be harmed 24 risk factors relating to western digital particularly loss of market share with a key customer could harm our operating results   a majority of our revenue comes from a few customers for example during 2001 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 60 of revenues these customers have a wide variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with us at any time our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance if we lose a key customer or if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs our operating results would likely be harmed for example this occurred with our enterprise hard drive product line early in the third quarter of 2000 and is one of the factors which led to our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market 

 

   because we do not manufacture any of the components in our hard drives an extended shortage of required components or the failure of key suppliers to remain in business adjust to market conditions or to meet our quality yield or production requirements could harm us more severely than our competitors some of whom manufacture certain of the components for their hard drives a number of the components used by us are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers if a component is in short supply or a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component this occurred in september 1999 when we had to shut down our caviar product line production for approximately two weeks as a result of a faulty power driver chip which was solesourced from a thirdparty supplier   to reduce the risk of component shortages we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these components as a result we may have to pay significant cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders as we did in 1998 when we accelerated our transition to magnetoresistive recording head technology and as we did in 2000 as a result of our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market   in april 1999 we entered into a threeyear volume purchase agreement with komag under which we buy a substantial portion of our media components from komag this strategic relationship has reduced our media component costs however it has increased our dependence on komag as a supplier our future operating results may depend substantially on komag’s ability to timely qualify its media components in our new development programs and to supply us with these components in sufficient volume to meet our production requirements a significant disruption in komag’s ability to manufacture and supply us with media could harm our operating results subsequent to june 29 2001 komag announced the voluntary filing for chapter 11 reorganization komag further announced that it expects to continue its operations during the chapter 11 process 

 

   under our “virtual vertical integration” business model we do not manufacture any of the parts used in our hard drives as a result the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable component suppliers to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our strategic component suppliers we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers and manage difficult scheduling and delivery problems 25 we have only one manufacturing facility which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of the facility   our volume manufacturing operations currently are based in one facility in malaysia a fire flood earthquake or other disaster or condition affecting our facility or the geographic area in which it is located would almost certainly result in a loss of substantial sales and revenue and harm our operating results manufacturing our products abroad subjects us to numerous risks   we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations including    we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by among other things entering into shortterm forward exchange contracts however those contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place as occurred in malaysia during the first quarter of 1999 as a result of the malaysian currency controls we are no longer hedging the malaysian currency risk our plan to broaden our business takes us into new markets   we are developing storage devices and content management software for the emerging broadband television market through our keen pm subsidiary we will be facing the challenge of developing products for a market that is still evolving and subject to rapid changes and shifting consumer preferences there are several competitors which have also entered this emerging market and there is no assurance that the market for digital storage devices for television and other audiovisual content will materialize or support all of these competitors   we have entered the data warehouse software and services market through our sagetree subsidiary and are considering other initiatives related to data and content management storage and communication in any of these initiatives we will be facing the challenge of developing products and services for markets that are still evolving and which have many current and potential competitors if we are not successful in these new initiatives it will likely harm our operating results   we have developed technologies and services for integrating highquality digital video into everyday computing through our cameo subsidiary we will be facing the challenge of developing products for a market that is still evolving and subject to rapid changes and shifting consumer preferences there is no assurance that the market for these products will materialize or that the products we produce will be acceptable to that market 

 

   the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights product liability claims and other types of litigation we are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders we also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights if 26 we conclude that a claim of infringement is valid we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense or modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly we may also be liable for any past infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would likely increase our costs and harm our operating results 

 

   our success depends in significant part on the proprietary nature of our technology including nonpatentable intellectual property such as our process technology despite safeguards to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology it may be difficult expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection also the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states in addition to patent protection of intellectual property rights we consider elements of our product designs and processes to be proprietary and confidential we rely upon employee consultant and vendor nondisclosure agreements and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary information however any of our registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be challenged or exploited by others in the industry which might harm our operating results inaccurate projections of demand for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly results   if we do not forecast total quarterly demand accurately it can have a material adverse effect on our quarterly results we typically book and ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter which makes it difficult for us to match our production plans to customer demands in addition our quarterly projections and results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including  rapidly changing market conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult to estimate actual results   we have made and continue to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting the rapidly changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions key estimates and assumptions for us include  27 the market price of our common stock is volatile   the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely volatile factors such as the following may significantly affect the market price of our common stock    in addition the stock market in recent months has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the stock price of many high technology companies these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of the companies   securities class action lawsuits are often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities a number of such suits have been filed against us in the past and any of these litigation matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management’s attention we may be unable to raise future capital through debt or equity financing   due to our recent financial performance and the risks described in this report in the future we may be unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital expenditures working capital and research and development we have a credit facility for our wdt subsidiary which matures on september 20 2003 if we decide to increase or accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development efforts or if results of operations do not meet our expectations we could require additional debt or equity financing however we cannot ensure that additional financing will be available to us or available on favorable terms an equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 

 

   we conduct substantial operations at our headquarters located in lake forest california and at our facilities located in san jose california and irvine california we rely on a continuous power supply in order to conduct those operations california’s current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses in the event of an acute power shortage that is when energy reserves for the state fall below 15 california has on some occasions implemented and may in the future implement rolling blackouts across the state although the governor and state legislators are working to prevent them in the future and although the company has backup energy reserves to last a short period rolling blackouts could interrupt our power supply and might temporarily render us unable to continue operations at our california facilities any such interruption in our ability to continue our operations at our california facilities could delay the development of products or disrupt communications with our customers suppliers or manufacturing operations either of which could harm our business and results of operations in addition if wholesale prices for electricity continue to increase our operating expenses would likely increase which might negatively affect our operating results 28 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about foreign currency risk   although the majority of the company’s transactions are in us dollars some transactions are based in various foreign currencies from time to time the company purchases shortterm forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets liabilities and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies the purpose for entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations to date a majority of the increases or decreases in the company’s local currency operating expenses are offset by gains and losses on the hedges the contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed twelve months the company does not purchase shortterm forward exchange contracts for trading purposes   historically the company has focused on hedging its foreign currency risk related to the singapore dollar the british pound and the malaysian ringgit with the establishment of currency controls and the prohibition of purchases or sales of the malaysian ringgit by offshore companies the company discontinued hedging its malaysian ringgit currency risk in 1999 future hedging of this currency will depend on currency conditions in malaysia the imposition of exchange controls by the malaysian government resulted in a 75 million realized loss on terminated hedging contracts in the first quarter of 1999 as a result of the closure of the company’s singapore operations in 2000 the company has also discontinued its hedging program related to the singapore dollar   as of june 29 2001 the company had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts in millions except average contract rate    in 1999 2000 and 2001 total realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses excluding the 75 million realized loss on the malaysian ringgits realized in 1999 were not material to the consolidated financial statements based on historical experience the company does not expect that a significant change in foreign exchange rates would materially affect the company’s consolidated financial statements disclosure about other market risks fixed interest rate risk   at june 29 2001 the market value of the company’s 525 zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due in 2018 was approximately 851 million compared to the related book value of 1125 million the convertible debentures will be repurchased by the company at the option of the holder as of february 18 2003 february 18 2008 or february 18 2013 or if there is a fundamental change as defined in the debenture documents at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption the payment on those dates with the exception of a fundamental change can be in cash stock or any combination at the company’s option   the company has a note receivable from another company that carries a fixed rate of interest therefore a significant change in interest rates would not cause these notes to impact the company’s consolidated financial statements variable interest rate risk   at the option of wdt borrowings under the senior credit facility would bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate plus a margin determined by the borrowing base this is the only debt which does not have a fixedrate of interest 29   the senior credit facility requires wdt to maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number of other covenants as of the date hereof there were no borrowings under the senior credit facility fair value risk   the company owns approximately 12 million shares of vixel common stock as of june 29 2001 the market value of the vixel shares was 31 million the company determines on a quarterly basis the fair market value of the vixel shares and records an unrealized gain or loss resulting from the difference in the fair market value of the shares as of the previous quarter end and the fair market value of the shares on the measurement date as of june 29 2001 a 31 million total accumulated unrealized gain has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss if the company sells all or a portion of this common stock any unrealized gain or loss on the date of sale will be recorded as a realized gain or loss in the company’s results of operations as a result of market conditions the market value of the shares had declined from 31 million as of june 29 2001 to 24 million as of august 17 2001 due to market fluctuations an additional decline in the stock’s fair market value could occur 30
