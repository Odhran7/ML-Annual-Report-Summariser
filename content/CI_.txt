cms evaluates medicare advantage plans and part d plans under its star rating system the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including for example quality of care preventive services chronic illness management coverage determinations and appeals and customer satisfaction a plans star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform very well are able to offer enhanced benefits and market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans medicare advantage plans qualitybonus payments are determined by the star rating with plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for such payments the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve and maintain four stars or greater for example beginning with star ratings for payment year 2024 cms will place more emphasis on patient experience surveybased measures which could reduce star ratings predictability year over year additionally as a result of the covid19 pandemics impact on 2020 care patterns and utilization cms finalized rules applying relief to medicare advantage and part d plan star ratings for payment year 2023 by utilizing the higher of the payment year 2023 or 2022 measure level star ratings 

cms uses a riskadjustment model that adjusts premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to customers health status the riskadjustment model generally pays more where a plans membership is expected to have increased costs because of the health status of its members under this model rates paid to medicare advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard medicarecovered benefits to an enrollee with a national average risk profile that baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership under the riskadjustment methodology medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines we generally rely on providers to appropriately document their claims and other submissions with appropriate diagnoses from which we extract hierarchical condition codes to submit to cms as the basis for our payments received under the actuarial riskadjustment model the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to the plans cms may conduct audits to validate riskadjustment data submitted by health plans in 2012 cms released a payment methodology that provided for sample audit error rates to be extrapolated to the entire medicare advantage contract after comparing audit results with a similar audit of medicare fee for service the ffs adjuster and applying an ffs adjuster to establish actuarial equivalency in payment rates as required by the medicare statute however a methodology to calculate the ffs adjuster was not finalized and cms has to date not completed any risk adjustment data validation radv audits using extrapolation 

on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule titled proposed rule on changes to ma and part d programs for cy 2020 and 2021 that would revise its radv methodology for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years by among other things extrapolating the error rate related to radv audit findings without applying the ffs adjuster if the proposed rule is adopted in its current form it could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits higher monthly premiums and reduced choice for the population served by all ma insurers the company along with other medicare advantage organizations and additional interested parties submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process the comment period concluded on august 28 2019 and cms issued guidance on october 20 2021 extending the timeline to finalize the proposed rule until november 2022 radv audits for our contract years 2011 through 2015 are currently in process it is uncertain whether cms will finalize the rule as proposed see below under federal and state oversight of governmentsponsored health care programs for a discussion of radv audits 

coverage of prescription drugs under medicare part d is also regulated by cms and our contracts with cms contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk these provisions affect our ultimate payments from cms for example premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor payments that compare costs targeted in our annual bids with actual prescription costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the payments we received 

we expect cms hhsoig doj and other federal agencies to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the medicare advantage program and modify the terms and requirements of the program through rulemaking or enforcement activities noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant consequences including fines and penalties enrollment sanctions exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs limitations on expansion and criminal penalties 

false claims act and antikickback laws 

our products and services are also subject to the federal false claims act the false claims act state false claims acts and federal and state antikickback laws additionally the federal government has made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks in return for customer referrals billing for unnecessary medical services upcoding and improper marketing the regulations and contractual requirements in this area are complex frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion and judicial interpretation 

false claims act and related criminal provisions the false claims act imposes civil penalties on any person who knowingly as defined by the statute makes conspires to make or causes to be made false claims records or statements or fails to return known overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs such as medicare and medicaid private individuals may bring qui tam or whistleblower suits under the false claims act which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit the aca amended the federal antikickback laws to state any claim submitted to a federal or state health care program that violates the antikickback laws is also a false claim under the false claims act the false claims act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages creating the possibility of substantial financial liabilities criminal statutes similar to the false claims act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement it knows to be false fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency the corporation may be fined conviction under these statutes may also result in exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs many states have also enacted laws similar to the false claims act some of which may include criminal penalties substantial fines and treble damages 

antikickback and referral laws subject to certain exceptions and safe harbors the federal antikickback statute generally prohibits among other things knowingly and willfully paying receiving or offering any payment or other remuneration to induce a person to purchase lease order or arrange for items including prescription drugs or services reimbursable in whole or in part under medicare medicaid or another federal health care program many states have similar laws some of which are not limited to items or services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antikickback laws may include criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs 

antikickback laws have been cited as a partial basis along with state consumer protection laws described below for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies or payors in connection with product conversion or promotion programs other antikickback and referral laws may also be applicable including criminal and civil laws restricting illegal kickbacks and conflicts of interest in connection with plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa the federal stark law and various state antikickback restrictions 

in november 2020 hhs and hhsoig released a final rule that eliminates an antikickback regulatory safe harbor protection for price concessions including rebates that are offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors or pharmacy benefit managers 

under the medicare part d program the final rule creates two new safe harbors i for price reductions by manufacturers to plan sponsors under medicare part d and medicaid managed care organizations that are reflected at the time of dispense and ii for fixedfee service arrangements between manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers the effective date of the final rule has been postponed to january 2026 a full repeal of the final rule is included in pending legislation 

federal civil monetary penalties law the federal civil monetary penalty statute provides for civil monetary penalties against any person who gives something of value to a medicare or medicaid program beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiarys selection of a particular provider for medicare or medicaid items or services under this law our whollyowned home delivery pharmacies specialty pharmacies and home health providers are restricted from offering certain items of value to influence a medicare or medicaid patients use of services the aca also includes several civil monetary provisions such as penalties for the failure to report and return a known overpayment and failure to grant timely access to the hhsoig under certain circumstances 

federal and state oversight of governmentsponsored health care programs 

participation in governmentsponsored health care programs subjects us to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under these programs these audits may occur years after the provision of services risks include potential fines and penalties restrictions on our ability to participate or expand our presence in certain programs and restrictions on marketing our plans for example with respect to our medicare advantage business cms and the hhsoig perform audits to determine a health plans compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including program audits and risk adjustment data validation audits which focus on compliance with proper coding practices certain of our contracts are currently subject to audits by cms and the hhsoig including radv audits cms has announced that its goal is to subject all medicare advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted radv audit for each contract year the doj is also currently conducting industrywide investigations of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

for our medicare part d business compliance with certain contractual provisions and regulatory requirements is subject to review by recovery audit contractor audits in which thirdparty contractors conduct postpayment reviews on a contingency fee basis to detect and correct improper payments 

government procurement regulations 

we have a contract with the us department of defense dod which subjects us to applicable federal acquisition regulations far and the dod far supplement which govern federal government contracts further there are other federal and state laws applicable to our dod arrangement and our arrangements with other clients that may be subject to government procurement regulations in addition certain of our clients participate as contracting carriers in the federal employees health benefits program administered by the opm which includes various pharmacy benefit management standards 

employee retirement income security act 

our domestic subsidiaries sell most of their products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by erisa erisa is a complex set of federal laws and regulations enforced by the irs and the dol as well as the courts erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationship between us the employers that maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to erisa and the participants in such plans certain of our domestic subsidiaries are also subject to requirements imposed by erisa affecting claim payment and appeals procedures for individual health insurance and insured and selfinsured group health plans and for the insured plans we administer certain of our domestic subsidiaries also may contractually agree to comply with these requirements on behalf of the selfinsured plans they administer we believe the conduct of our pharmacy benefit management business is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of erisa however there can be no assurances that the dol may not assert that pharmacy benefit managers are fiduciaries from time to time states have considered legislation to declare a pharmacy benefit manager or health benefit manager a fiduciary with respect to its clients 

plans subject to erisa may also be subject to state laws and the legal question of whether and to what extent erisa preempts a state law is likely to continue to be a subject for interpretation by the courts for years to come 

privacy security and data standards regulations 

many of our activities involve the receipt or use of confidential health and other personal information in addition we use aggregated and deidentified data for our own research and analysis purposes and in some cases provide access to such deidentified data or analytics created from such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators we may also use such information 

to create analytic models designed to predict and potentially improve outcomes and patient care there are also industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements for using and disclosing personal information additionally over the past several years various broad privacy laws have been introduced into one or both chambers of congress however to date none have been enacted 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations hipaa impose minimum standards on health insurers pharmacy benefit managers hmos health plans health care providers and clearinghouses for the privacy and security of protected health information hipaa regulations may also hold us liable for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers hipaa also established rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions including but not limited to eligibility and claims to the extent insurers offer plans through a public exchange participants and their downstream entities such as pharmacy benefit managers must adhere to privacy and security standards for personally identifiable information and to impose standards that are at least as protective as those the exchange has implemented for itself these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech imposes additional contracting requirements for covered entities the extension of privacy and security provisions to business associates the requirement to provide notification to various parties in the event of a data breach of protected health information and enhanced financial penalties for hipaa violations including potential criminal penalties for individuals in the conduct of our business depending on the circumstances we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate 

the federal grammleachbliley act glba and its implementing regulations generally place restrictions on the disclosure of nonpublic information to nonaffiliated third parties and requires financial institutions including insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures state departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law 

state and local authorities are increasingly focused on protecting individuals from identity theft and a number of states have adopted comprehensive data security laws and regulations requiring among other things certain minimum data security standards and security breach notifications that may apply to us in certain circumstances as well as certain limitations on access to and use of personal information neither hipaa nor the glba privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations which may differ in approach and enforcement 

states have in recent years begun to adopt their own omnibus industryneutral privacy statutes to date three states have passed such laws california which originally went into effect in 2020 and has been subsequently amended to strengthen consumer rights as well as colorado and virginia both effective in 2023 generally these statutes are not applicable to data regulated by glba and hipaa but are in varying respects applicable to other data we collect such as personal data provided by website visitors employees and business partners we anticipate federal and state legislators and regulators to continue to enact legislation related to privacy and cybersecurity including with respect to ransomware incidents 

under section 5 of the federal trade commission act ftc act the ftc has jurisdiction over certain privacy and security practices section 5 of the ftc act bars unfair and deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce and the ftc has charged companies with violating this act based on failures to appropriately and transparently safeguard personal information and respect consumers privacy rights in addition to the ftc act the ftc also enforces other federal laws relating to consumers privacy and security the ftc has also been active with respect to companies use of big data and artificial intelligence ai specifically ensuring fair and equitable use of these tools and the ftc has named ai as an area of enforcement focus state legislatures and regulators are similarly interested in the use of ai particularly as it is used in modeling and a handful of states have either passed legislation or issued regulatory guidance concerning ai additionally the national association of insurance commissioners naic an organization of state insurance regulators recently established the innovation cybersecurity and technology committee to provide a forum for regulators to learn monitor and confer on emerging technology issues including among others cybersecurity and ai 

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 cisa encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry states have also begun to issue regulations specifically related to cybersecurity which may differ or conflict from state to state in october 2017 the naic adopted the insurance data security model law that creates rules for insurers and other covered entities addressing data security investigation and notification of breaches this includes maintaining an information security program based on ongoing risk assessment overseeing thirdparty service providers investigating data breaches 

and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event as the model law is intended to serve as model legislation only states will need to enact legislation for the model law to become mandatory and enforceable to date eleven states have enacted some form of the model law 

hhs including the onc the office for civil rights and cms has enacted regulations and proposed additional regulations to support the seamless and secure access exchange and use of electronic health information by or between patients enrollees and entities such as payers and health care providers which is generally termed interoperability these regulations include among others proposed changes to hipaa designed to promote greater patient access and control over health information maintained by health plans and health care providers and improve information sharing for case management and care coordination other interoperability regulations prohibit information blocking by certain entities and require certain regulated plans to make specified patient clinical and planrelated data available to enrollees via interoperable technology and applications these regulations apply to a variety of entities including health plans like medicare plans and qualified health plans as well as health care providers certified health information technology developers and health information networks and exchanges and generally require significant enhancements to information technology and data governance practices the regulations and proposals demonstrate an increased interest in information sharing and will impact how industry participants including us comply with disclosure requirements and share information with individuals and other healthcare organizations we continue to monitor developments and to submit comments on proposed regulations where appropriate 

in addition international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of personal information can be more stringent than those in the united states and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective may 2018 enhanced or created obligations regarding the handling of personal data relating to european residents such as regarding notices data protection impact assessments and individual rights and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance than the previous european directive or laws in addition many countries outside of europe where we conduct business have implemented or may implement data protection laws and regulations some of which include requirements modeled after those in the gdpr some nonus jurisdictions are also instituting data residency regulations requiring that data be maintained within the respective jurisdiction or otherwise restricting transfer of personal data across borders unless specified regulatory requirements are met 

see part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with privacy and security regulations 

consumer protection laws 

we engage in directtoconsumer activities and are increasingly offering mobile and webbased solutions to our customers we are therefore subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and other consumer protection laws and regulations such as the telephone consumer protection act and the canspam act with the ever increasing reliance and demand by consumers on using their mobile devices for convenient communications we face increased risk under these laws the ftc is also increasingly exercising its enforcement authority in the areas of consumer privacy and data security with a focus on webbased mobile data and big data federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information 

state and federal policymakers have taken actions intended to increase transparency and predictability of health care costs for consumers for example in october 2020 the hhs the dol and the department of the treasury issued a final rule that requires most group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose price and costsharing information for all items and services to participants and enrollees the costsharing information requirements under the rule take effect in a phased approach beginning january 1 2023 in addition to providing personalized costsharing information beginning january 1 2022 health plans and health insurers must also publicly disclose i innetwork provider negotiated rates ii historical outofnetwork allowed amounts and billed charges and iii innetwork negotiated rates and historical net prices for all covered prescription drugs beginning in 2021 insurers will be able to receive credit in their mlr calculations for certain savings they share with enrollees in august 2021 the departments jointly released guidance regarding the implementation of the rule importantly the guidance announced that the agencies will i indefinitely defer enforcement of the rules requirement that plans and issuers publish machinereadable files relating to prescription drug pricing pending further rulemaking and ii defer enforcement of the rules requirement to publish the remaining machinereadable files until july 1 2022 congress also passed the consolidated appropriations act 2021 caa which included a number of transparency requirements on plans and issuers that are duplicative or overlap with the october 2020 rule issued by the departments the indefinite enforcement deferral of the prescription drug pricing file under the october 2020 rule is in part due to the subsequent enactment of the caa which requires plans to report information regarding prescription drug spending to federal regulators beginning in 2022 

as part of the aforementioned caa congress passed the no surprises act which prohibits health care providers in certain situations from balance billing the patient and requires that they work directly with insurers to agree on outofnetwork reimbursement including utilizing an independent dispute resolution process outlined in the act the act is effective january 1 2022 many states already have addressed balance billing or surprise medical bills these laws and regulations vary in their approach resulting in different impacts on the health care system as a whole 

additionally most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs such statutes have also been cited as the basis for claims or investigations by state attorneys general relative to privacy and data security 

office of foreign assets control sanctions and antimoney laundering 

we are also subject to regulation by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes based on us foreign policy and national security goals certain of our products are subject to the department of the treasury antimoney laundering regulations under the bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to similar regulations in nonus jurisdictions in which we operate 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

many states in which our subsidiaries operate limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed health care providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business 

utilization management laws 

state legislatures have begun to propose and enact laws exempting certain providers from preauthorization requirements of insurers these exemptions reduce the ability for insurers and medical management entities from reviewing services for medical necessity if the provider meets the laws established thresholds for approval rates in the preceding six months the inability to apply preauthorization requirements could lead to increased costs to plan issuers by way of the provision of unnecessary services states are also standardizing the process for and restricting the use of utilization management rules and shortening the time frames within which prescription drug prior authorization determinations must be made even where states do not regulate pharmacy benefit or utilization management companies directly these laws will apply to many of our clients including managed care organizations and health insurers 

laws and legislation affecting pharmacy benefit plan design administration and pharmacy network access 

some states have enacted laws that prohibit managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive benefit plan design features and many states have laws or have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to the pharmacy benefit for example some states under socalled freedom of choice legislation provide customers of the plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers some states have also enacted legislation that can negatively impact the use of costsaving network configurations for plan sponsors such as limiting the implementation of pharmacy benefit designs and reimbursement structures that leverage affiliate pharmacies to reduce costs other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering customers financial incentives for use of home delivery pharmacies medicare and some states have issued guidance and regulations that limit our ability to fill or refill prescriptions electronically submitted by a physician to our home delivery pharmacy without first obtaining consent from the patient such restrictions generate additional costs and limit our ability to maximize efficiencies which could otherwise be gained through the electronic prescription and automatic refill processes legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention or to require coverage of all food and drug administration approved drugs other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and require health plan coverage of specific drugs if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician 

additionally medicare part d and a majority of states now have laws regulations or some form of legislation affecting our ability or our clients ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove a provider from a network such laws regulations or 

legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy or provider willing to meet the plans terms and conditions for network participation any willing provider or may direct that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures due process 

certain states have laws prohibiting certain pharmacy benefit management clients from imposing additional copayments deductibles limitations on benefits or other conditions on covered individuals utilizing a retail pharmacy when the same conditions are not otherwise imposed on covered individuals utilizing home delivery pharmacies however the laws require the retail pharmacy to agree to the same reimbursement amounts and terms and conditions as are imposed on the home delivery pharmacies an increase in the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies may have a negative impact on the number of prescriptions filled through home delivery 

pharmacy benefit manager and drug pricing regulation 

our pharmacy benefit management services are subject to numerous laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern and proposed legislation and regulations may govern critical practices including disclosure receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers certain pharmacy contracting practices including disclosure of cost information to customers the receipt and retention of transmission fees from contracted pharmacies use of administration of or changes to drug formularies the use and disclosure of maximum allowable cost mac pricing or clinical programs most favored nation pricing which provides that a pharmacy participating in a specific government program must give the program the best price the pharmacy makes available to any thirdparty plan disclosure of data to third parties drug utilization management practices the level of duty a pharmacy benefit manager owes its clients or customers configuration of pharmacy networks the operations of our subsidiary pharmacies disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates disclosure of negotiated drug rebates calculation of certain customer costshare for prescription drug claims pricing that includes differential or spread ie a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsor by a pharmacy benefit manager and the price paid by the manager to the dispensing provider disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to customers drug utilization and registration or licensing of pharmacy benefit managers 

we expect federal and state governments to continue to prioritize means of addressing outofpocket costs for consumers particularly related to prescription drug costs policy proposals issued via regulation or legislation vary broadly in their approaches to achieve that goal current proposed legislation includes among other things repeal of hhss final rule amending the antikickback safe harbors as described above under the heading false claims act and antikickback laws—antikickback and referral laws government price negotiation of certain classes of prescription drugs covered by medicare part b and d limits on manufacturer price increases for prescription drugs and a redesign of the medicare part d benefit additionally proposals at the federal and state levels consider increased regulation of pharmacy benefit managers and health plans as a means to limit consumer outofpocket costs including proposing to limit the use of various pharmacy benefit management tools mandating the treatment of fees discounts or financing mechanisms that otherwise are set in private contractual terms increasing supply chain transparency expanding regulatory requirements or definitions of fiduciaries or mandating plan benefit designs that cap consumer outofpocket expense 

some states have enacted statutes regulating the use of mac pricing these statutes referred to as mac transparency laws generally require pharmacy benefit managers to disclose specific information related to mac pricing to pharmacies and provide certain appeal rights for pharmacies mac transparency laws also restrict the application of mac and may require operational changes to maintain compliance with the law some states have also enacted laws regulating pharmacy pricing and protecting the profitability of pharmacies for dispensing certain macpriced drugs some states have enacted laws requiring that the customer costshare for a prescription drug claim not exceed certain price points such as the pharmacys usual and customary charge or its contracted reimbursement for the drug in a recent supreme court decision the court found that certain mac transparency laws may be applied by states to erisa plans in addition to health plans regulated by the applicable state following this decision state legislatures and regulators have sought to extend their oversight authority of selffunded erisa plans to pharmacy benefit management functions and pharmacy benefit plan designs beyond mac pricing 

in march 2018 the naic adopted changes to the health carrier prescription drug benefit management model act the changes address issues relating to i transparency accuracy and disclosure regarding prescription drug formularies and formulary changes during a policy year ii accessibility of prescription drug benefits using a variety of pharmacy options and iii tiered prescription drug formularies and discriminatory benefit design while the actions of the naic do not have the force of law they are used as a template to influence states to adopt laws based on the model legislation 

the federal medicaid drug rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs reimbursed through state medicaid programs including through medicaid managed care organizations manufacturers of brandname products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a 231 of the average manufacturer price amp paid by retail community 

pharmacies or by wholesalers for certain drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies or b the difference between amp and the best price available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program and certain other government programs with certain exceptions we negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and in certain circumstances sell services to drug manufacturers investigations are being and have been conducted by certain government entities which call into question whether a drugs best price was properly calculated and reported with respect to rebates paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for such calculations reports or payments 

pharmacy regulation 

our home delivery and specialty pharmacies also subject us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy we are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the states in which our pharmacies are located most of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require outofstate home delivery pharmacies to register with or be licensed by the board of pharmacy or a similar regulatory body in the state these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state where the pharmacy is located although some states require compliance with certain laws in that state as it impacts or relates to drugs distributed or dispensed into that state 

our various pharmacy facilities also provide services under certain medicare and state medicaid programs participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs in addition several of our pharmacy facilities are participating providers under medicare part d and are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to medicare part d additionally we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our medicare plans and pricing between our plans and related parties including our pharmacy business 

other statutes and regulations affect our home delivery and specialty pharmacy operations including the federal and state antikickback laws and the federal civil monetary penalty law described above federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising adulteration and security of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances and certain of our pharmacies must register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities the ftc requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the product to be sold to fill mail orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate the united states postal service also has significant statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail 

financial reporting internal control and corporate governance 

regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and hmos states regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements the type and concentration of permitted investments and corporate governance over financial reporting our insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports and schedules with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which they do business as well as annual financial statements audited by independent registered public accounting firms certain insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file an annual report of internal control over financial reporting with most jurisdictions in which they do business insurance and hmo subsidiaries operations and financial statements are subject to examination by such agencies many states have expanded regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of insurance and hmo subsidiaries as a result of model regulations adopted by the naic with elements similar to corporate governance and risk oversight disclosure requirements under federal securities laws 

guaranty associations indemnity funds risk pools and administrative funds 

most states and certain nonus jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds that are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies some states have similar laws relating to hmos and other payors such as consumer operated and oriented plans coops established under the aca in the united states these associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims certain states require hmos to participate in guaranty funds special risk pools and administrative funds for additional information about guaranty funds and other assessments see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

certain states continue to require health insurers and hmos to participate in assigned risk plans joint underwriting authorities pools or other residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards although some states have eliminated these requirements as a result of the aca 

solvency and capital requirements 

many states have adopted some form of the naic model solvencyrelated laws and riskbased capital rbc rules for life and health insurance companies and hmos the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred if the ratio of the insurers adjusted surplus to its rbc falls below statutorily required minimums the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 

in addition various nonus jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency liquidity and reserve coverage measures our hmos and life and health insurance subsidiaries as well as nonus insurance subsidiaries are compliant with applicable rbc and nonus surplus rules 

the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act orsa adopted by the naic provides requirements and principles for maintaining a group solvency assessment and a risk management framework and reflects a broader approach to us insurance regulation orsa includes a requirement to file an annual orsa summary report in the lead state of domicile to date an overwhelming majority of the states have adopted the same or similar versions of orsa we file our orsa report annually as required 

holding company laws 

our domestic insurance companies and certain of our hmos are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies under such laws certain dividends distributions and other transactions between an insurance company or an hmo subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to or approval by one or more state insurance commissioners in addition the holding company acts of states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo subsidiary without prior regulatory approval state holding company laws and regulations also subject our insurance companies and certain hmo subsidiaries to additional regulatory scrutiny related to their oversight of affiliates performing regulated services on behalf of the insurance company or hmo and require the company to file an annual enterprise risk report which summarizes material risks that could pose enterprise risk to the insurance company subsidiaries 

marketing advertising and products 

in most states our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are required to certify compliance with applicable advertising regulations on an annual basis our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are also required by most states to file and secure regulatory approval of products prior to the marketing advertising and sale of such products 

licensing and registration requirements 

our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business additionally certain subsidiaries contract to provide claim administration utilization management and other related services for the administration of selfinsured benefit plans these subsidiaries may be subject to state thirdparty administration and other licensing requirements and regulation as well as thirdparty accreditation requirements 

we have received full accreditation for utilization review accreditation commission pharmacy benefit management version 22 standards which includes quality standards for drug utilization management and select subsidiaries have received full accreditation for utilization review accreditation commission for health utilization management version 72 which includes quality standards for medical utilization management 

certain states have adopted pharmacy benefit management registration licensure or disclosure laws in addition to registration laws some states have adopted legislation mandating disclosure of various aspects of our financial practices including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms 

our international subsidiaries are often required to be licensed when entering new markets or starting new operations in certain jurisdictions the licensure requirements for these subsidiaries vary by country and are subject to change 

international regulations 

our operations outside the united states expose us to laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies and regulators including those related to the provision of insurance financial and other disclosures the provision of health 

carerelated services corporate governance privacy data protection data mining data transfer intellectual property labor and employment consumer protection directtoconsumer communications activities tax anticorruption and antimoney laundering foreign laws and rules may include requirements that are different from or more stringent than similar requirements in the united states 

our operations in countries outside the united states 

• are subject to local regulations of the jurisdictions where we operate 

• in some cases are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions where customers reside and 

• in all cases are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 

in particular in south korea regulators are focused on protecting the rights of individual customers by enforcing treating customers fairly concepts this regulatory focus has resulted in rigorous data localization requirements network separation obligations and system monitoring restrictions as well as obligations to closely monitor marketing communications and sales scripts antimoney laundering requirements in south korea and other countries where we do business also may impose obligations to collect certain information about each customer at time of sale or to risk rank each customer to determine possible future money laundering risk 

the fcpa prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official or employee to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage outside of the united states we may interact with government officials in several different capacities as regulators of our insurance business as clients or partners who are stateowned or partially stateowned as health care providers who are employed by the government as hospitals that are stateowned and as officials issuing permits in connection with real estate transactions violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and doj have increased their enforcement activities with respect to fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 applies to all companies with a nexus to the united kingdom under this act any voluntary disclosures of fcpa violations may be shared with united kingdom authorities thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions other countries in which we do business also have anticorruption laws to which we are subject 




 item 1a risk factors 

as a large global health services company operating in a complex industry we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity results of operations financial condition or the trading price of our securities you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below together with other information contained in this form 10k including mda these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance 

strategic and operational risks 

future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively 

the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors including our ability to 

• differentiate our products services and solutions from those of our competitors 

• develop and bring to market new and innovative products solutions or programs that focus on improving patient outcomes and experiences and assist in controlling costs or in response to government regulation 

• develop and create data and analytic solutions to support and improve outcomes for our products services and solutions including creating and developing solutions and services through partnerships with other industry participants 

• grow and support our product portfolio expand our addressable markets and identify and introduce the proper mix coordination or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace 

• evaluate drugs for efficacy value and price to assist clients in selecting a costeffective formulary 

• offer costeffective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services 

• access or continue accessing key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories in our specialty pharmacy business 

• attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees particularly in an increasingly competitive job market 

• attract develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners 

• attract new and maintain existing customer and client relationships 

• leverage purchase volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers 

• transition health care providers from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased system 

• improve medical cost competitiveness in our targeted markets 

• manage our medical pharmacy administrative and other operating costs effectively and 

• contract with health care providers pharmacy providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers on market competitive terms 

for our strategic initiatives to succeed we must effectively collaborate across our operations integrate our acquired businesses actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization and promote a global mindset along with a focus on individual customers and clients if we fail to do so our business may be unable to grow as planned or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory we will be unable to rapidly respond to competitive economic and regulatory changes if we do not make important strategic and operational decisions quickly define our appetite for risk implement new governance managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly if these initiatives fail or are not executed effectively our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected 

we operate in a highly competitive evolving and rapidly changing industry and our failure to adapt could negatively impact our business 

the health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving any significant shifts in the structure of the industry could alter industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients and customers industry shifts could result and have resulted from among other things 

• a large intra or interindustry merger or industry consolidation 

• strategic alliances 

• new or alternative business models or new government options or offerings 

• continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other health care providers as well as changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and health care providers 

• new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health service industry 

• the ability of larger employers and clients to contract directly with providers 

• technological changes and rapid shifts in the use of technology such as telehealth 

• the impact or consequences of legislation or regulatory changes 

• changes in the united states postal service or the consolidation of shipping carriers 

• increased drug acquisition cost or unexpected changes to drug pricing trend 

• changes in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market or 

• changes in utilization of health care prescription drugs or other covered services and items including under riskbased contracts in the health benefit management market and for those businesses that utilize risk adjustment methodology 

our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the scale scope and duration of the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to be unknown and the overall impact on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition has been and may continue to be material 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and is continuing to affect global economies financial markets and the overall environment for our business and the extent to which it may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain while vaccination rates continue to rise the covid19 pandemic including vaccination efficacy the implementation of and reaction to vaccination and testing mandates and the occurrence of new variants including the delta and omicron variants could continue to effect such economies and financial markets as well as the health and availability of our workforce as a result we may experience new disruptions to our business operations and our business could be adversely affected further directly or indirectly by the ongoing pandemic national state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement varying safety precautions including quarantines border closures increased border controls travel restrictions shelterinplace orders and shutdowns business closures cancellations of public gatherings and other measures 

the covid19 pandemic has in some instances and may continue to heighten the potential adverse effects on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition as described below or in other risk factors within this section of the form 10k including but not limited to the likelihood of and impact from 

• unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers both employers and individuals health care and pharmacy providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty vendors as well as federal and state entities and programs 

• changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures changes in customer base and product mix changes in utilization of prescription drugs medical or other covered items or services including increased behavioral health services utilization changes in medical cost trends changes in our health management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products causing actual claims to exceed our estimates 

• changes in health care utilization patterns provider billing practices and other external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control impacting our ability to accurately predict price for and manage health care costs and ultimately our profitability including impacts from care deferral on among other things risk adjustment revenue and acuity of future care 

• increased costs or reductions in revenue including costs for covid19related care testing and treatment vaccine and other coverage mandates inflation and support for employees clients customers and providers 

• significant disruptions in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties including delivery delays and other supply chain impacts and decreased worker productivity increased worker attrition and operational and sales disruptions including as a result of remote working arrangements increased medical emergency or other leave quarantines government actions or restrictions including as it relates to vaccination mandates 

• compliance with substantial government regulation including privacy and security requirements associated with providing telehealth and remote care options and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations such as vaccine testing and coverage mandates and premium deferrals which laws or regulations may vary significantly by jurisdiction 

• prioritization of matters relating to covid19 resulting in delays in responsiveness by regulatory agencies and other third parties in matters arising in the ordinary course of business 

• cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents including as a result of the transition to a remote work environment by substantially all of our workforce and the workforces of third parties with whom we contract 

• significant shifts in the structure of the industry which could alter dynamics and if we fail to adapt negatively impact our business 

• risks inherent in foreign operations including political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks 

• economic and market conditions affecting the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities and 

• fluctuations in equity market prices interest rates and credit spreads limiting our ability to raise or deploy capital and affecting our overall liquidity 

additionally if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if our clients or customers do not perceive our response to be adequate we could suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

we believe covid19 and its variants adverse impact on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition will be driven primarily by the severity and duration of the pandemic including the impact of the breadth and timing of implementation and the efficacy and costs of vaccination programs the pandemics continued impact on our employees clients customers suppliers and partners as well as the us and global economies and the continued actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic those primary drivers are largely beyond our knowledge and control and may be more adverse than our current expectations given these uncertainties we cannot estimate the full impact covid19 will have on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition but the adverse impact could be material 

our failure to compete effectively to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and maintain or increase market share could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer and client needs legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors in particular markets our competitors may have greater better or more established capabilities resources market share reputation or business relationships or lower profit margin or financial return expectations our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between our competitors and us our express scripts client contracts generally have threeyear terms and may be subject to periodic renegotiation of pricing terms based on market factors as described in greater detail in the description of our business in item 1 of this form 10k one of our key clients in the evernorth segment is the department of defense if one or more of our large clients terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason including as a result of being acquired or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in decreases in the trading price of our securities or other adverse effects 

our success depends in part on our ability to compete effectively in our markets set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share increase customers as planned differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that provide enhanced value to our customers provide quality and satisfactory levels of service and retain accounts with favorable medical cost experience or more profitable products versus retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience or less profitable products 

we must remain competitive to attract new customers retain existing customers and further integrate additional product and service offerings to succeed in this highly competitive marketplace it is imperative that we maintain a strong reputation increasingly our customers clients and investors consider our efforts on a variety of matters that could impact our stakeholders including our employees and the communities in which we operate such as our efforts with respect to the environment and diversity equity and inclusion the negative reputational impact of a significant event including a failure to execute on customer or client contracts or strategic or operational initiatives failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our customers could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable arrangements which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we face price competition and other pressures that could compress our margins or result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of services delivered to our customers 

while we compete on the basis of many service and qualityrelated factors we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition our client contracts are subject to negotiation as clients seek to contain their costs including by reducing benefits offered increasingly our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met clients can easily move between our competitors and us our clients are well informed and typically have knowledgeable consultants that seek competing bids from our competitors before contract renewal in addition as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams they look to take on services that we typically provide each of these events could negatively impact our financial results 

federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict or prevent entirely our ability to implement changes in premium rates fiscal or other concerns related to the governmentsponsored programs in which we participate such as medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans may cause decreasing reimbursement rates delays in premium payments restrictions on implementing changes in premium rates or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of customers or clients resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

premiums in the cigna healthcare segment are generally set for oneyear periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences or renews our revenue on medicare advantage plans individual and family plans ifp and medicare part d plans is based on rates and bids submitted midyear in the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare advantage ifp and medicare part d rates and bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period actual costs may exceed what we estimate in setting premiums our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control including changes in regulations as well as provider billing practices and changes in customers health care utilization patterns which may among other things impact our ability to appropriately document their health conditions our participation in health insurance exchanges through our ifp offerings involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows our profitability depends in part on our ability to accurately predict price for and effectively manage future health care costs relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results 

strong competition within the pharmacy benefit business has also generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings these competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many companies including us to reduce the prices charged for products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the formulary fees and related rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers our inability to maintain positive trends or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited 

we maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including historical claim experience but this estimation process requires extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures changes in customer base and product mix changes in the utilization of prescription drugs medical or other covered items or services changes in medical cost trends changes in our health management practices changes in regulations and the introduction of new benefits and products if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited additionally we must estimate the amount of rebates payable by us under the acas and cms minimum loss ratio rules and the amounts payable by us to and receivable by us from the united states federal government under the acas remaining premium stabilization program because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing reserves which may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health service providers and with producers and consultants our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we contract with or employ physicians hospitals and other health service providers and facilities to provide health services to our customers our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices in any particular market physicians hospitals and health service providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products or services for our customers in some markets certain providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations and multispecialty physician groups may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us if providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially adversely affected additionally certain regulations may impact our ability to obtain competitive prices establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups specialist groups independent practice associations hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased health care system if such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected 

our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers may also be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us such as changes in medicare or medicaid reimbursement levels increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals physician groups and providers continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other providers the emergence of accountable care organizations vertical integration of providers and other entities changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and providers new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health care industry and the increased use of virtual care services including telehealth may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate in some instances these organizations may compete directly with us potentially affecting the way we price our products and services or causing us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive 

outofnetwork providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill while benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement and regulations seek to prescribe payment levels establish methodologies and dispute resolution processes providers are increasingly sophisticated and aggressive as a result the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

additionally certain of our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we compete our sales could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

if we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we maintain relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with among other things 

• discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies 

• discounts in the form of rebates for drug utilization 

• fees for administering rebate programs including invoicing allocating and collecting rebates 

• fees for services provided to pharmaceutical manufacturers by our specialty pharmacies and 

• access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals by our specialty pharmacies 

our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers are typically nonexclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party the consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers the termination or material alteration of our relationships or our failure to renew contracts on market competitive terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums adoption of new laws rules or regulations or changes in or new interpretations of existing laws rules or regulations relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

more than 67900 pharmacies participated in one or more of our networks as of december 31 2021 the ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 62 of the total number of stores in our largest network in certain geographic areas of the united states our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains contracts with retail pharmacies are generally nonexclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party if one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us or is able to renegotiate terms substantially less favorable to us our customers access to retail pharmacies or our business could be materially adversely affected the entry of one or more additional large pharmacy chains into the pharmacy benefit management business the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could have a negative impact on our claims volume or our competitiveness in the marketplace which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations 

changes in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy clients generally use pricing metrics published by third parties as benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs if these benchmarks are no longer published by third parties we or our contractual partners adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry legislation or regulation requires the use of other pricing benchmarks or future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations the short or longterm impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a global company we face political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations or our longterm growth 

as a global company our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks can vary substantially by market and include political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks including government intervention that we do not face in our us operations the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

• geopolitical business conditions and demands 

• regulation that may discriminate against us companies favor nationalization or expropriate assets 

• price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds out of the countries in which we operate foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations and restrictions on converting currencies from foreign operations into other currencies uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of tax positions 

• reliance on local employees and interpretations of labor laws in foreign jurisdictions 

• managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the united states 

• providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations 

• the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements 

• acts of civil unrest war and terrorism as well as other political and economic conflicts such as through imposition of economic or political sanctions 

• manmade disasters natural disasters including those arising as a result of climate change and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic in locations where we operate and 

• general economic and political conditions 

these factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally and operating in new foreign markets may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or longterm growth for example if were unable to divest our south korean business we will continue to be exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that country and the geopolitical climate in the korean peninsula as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean currency that due to the current concentration of our international business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results 

international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply 

with and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with us and foreign laws prohibiting bribery corruption and money laundering in addition to other regulations regarding among other things our products directtoconsumer communications customer privacy data protection and data residency violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and longterm growth 

strategic transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges 

as part of our strategy we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures licensing arrangements divestitures and other relationships collectively referred to as strategic transactions there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities and we may be unable to identify and successfully complete strategic transactions in the future in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives and we may divest or wind down such businesses we may be unable to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us within the expected timeframes or at all we may have continued financial exposure to divested businesses following the completion of any such transaction including increased costs due to potential litigation contingent liabilities and indemnification of the buyer related to among other things lawsuits regulatory matters or tax liabilities 

our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to successfully combine or separate business operations resources and systems including data security systems and internal financial control standards in an efficient and effective manner integration and separation activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected these activities are complex costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention from ongoing business concerns delays or issues encountered in these activities could have a material adverse effect on the revenues expenses operating results and financial condition of the company additionally the benefits of strategic transactions and the related timing could be impacted by various factors including political instability natural disasters fluctuations in currency exchange rates delays in obtaining regulatory approval and changes in regulations 

strategic transactions could result in increased costs including facilities and systems consolidation or separation costs and costs to retain key employees decreases in expected revenues earnings or cash flows and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges as of december 31 2021 our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of approximately 80 billion representing 52 of our total consolidated assets the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if the businesses we acquire do not perform in a manner consistent with our assumptions future evaluations requiring an impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders equity could negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill and intangibles in addition the trading price of our securities may decline if among other things we are unable to achieve our estimates of earnings growth and operational cost savings or the transaction costs are greater than expected the trading price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of a transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts 

additionally joint ventures and equity investments present risks that are different from acquisitions including risks related to specific operations and finances of the businesses we invest in selection of appropriate parties differing objectives of the various parties competition between and among parties compliance activities including compliance with applicable cms requirements growing the business in a manner acceptable to all the parties maintaining positive relationships among the parties clients and customers initial and ongoing governance of joint ventures and customer and business disruption that may occur upon a joint venture termination 

further we may finance strategic transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders or by incurring additional debt that could increase costs and impact our ability to access capital in the future 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud the integration of businesses is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations we also rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of joint venture entities and other entities in which we invest and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could 

negatively impact the trading price of our securities and our access to capital 

we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions 

to improve operating costs productivity and efficiencies we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services our operations may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a contractual dispute between us and the third party even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections we have limited control over the actions of third parties for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations any security breach involving one of our thirdparty vendors or a dispute between us and a thirdparty vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations adopt new processes for managing these service providers or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our thirdparty vendors do not perform as expected we may not realize or not realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships this could result in additional costs or regulatory compliance issues or create other operational or financial problems for us terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach termination or transition in services we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and in turn our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

a significant disruption in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as claims processing and payment internet support and customer call centers data centers and corporate facilities processing new and renewal business maintaining appropriate shipment and storage conditions for prescriptions such as temperature and protection from contamination and home delivery processing in some instances our ability to provide services or products including processing and dispensing prescriptions depends on the availability of services and products provided by suppliers providers pharmaceutical manufacturers vendors or shipping carriers a disruption or threat of disruption in our supply chain including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business 

increasing natural disasters in connection with climate change could also be a direct threat to us and our thirdparty vendors service providers or other stakeholders natural disasters such as wildfires hurricanes and snow and ice storms have impacted and may continue to impact our customers and pose a risk to our employees and facilities located in the impacted region responses to such scenarios have and may include among other things making temporary policy changes such as waiving various medical requirements assisting with replacement medications transferring prescriptions and expanding our help line in addition there is a risk that actions taken to respond to climate change could increase the cost of energy fuel and other commodities which would increase our operating costs 

we are also subject to risk as a result of information technology disruptions any failure or disruption of our performance of or our ability to perform key business functions including through unavailability or cyberattack of our information technology systems or those of third parties including cloud service providers could cause slower response times decreased levels of service satisfaction and harm to our reputation our systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems and we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption 

while we have adopted and continue to enhance business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies there is no guarantee that such plans and strategies will be effective which could interrupt the functionality of our information technology systems or those of third parties our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations 

our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation availability and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care providers and to operate our business if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable 

due to fraud or other error or if we or any of the thirdparty providers we engage were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients customers and health care providers and hinder our ability to provide or establish appropriate pricing for products and services retain and attract clients and customers establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance among other things 

our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success we must continue to invest in and maintain longterm solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations enhance the customer experience act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats or other events that could disrupt our information technology systems such as manmade or natural disasters including those as a result of climate change our success is dependent in large part on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a costefficient and resourceefficient manner increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important we must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner further because system development projects are longterm in nature they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion our failure to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation availability and data integrity of our systems could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

as a large health services company we and our vendors are subject to cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks or fail to ensure vendors do the same we may suffer exposure to substantial liability reputational harm loss of revenue or other damages 

our business depends on our clients and customers willingness to entrust us with their healthrelated and other sensitive personal information including information that is subject to privacy security or data notification laws computer systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses or malware programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems we have been and will likely continue to be the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access cyberattacks or other computerrelated penetrations there have been and will likely continue to be large scale cyberattacks within the health service industry additionally hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information technology human or technological error has and could in the future result in for example unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of company customer or other thirdparty data or systems theft of sensitive regulated or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware destructive attacks or other means and business delays service or system disruptions or denials of service 

as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally our exposure to unintended disclosures data security and related cybersecurity risks increases including the risk of undetected attacks damage loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases the healthcare data ecosystem is complex and requires data exchange with vendors business partners the government and others if disruptions disclosures or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded we have dedicated significant resources to implement security technologies processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks however there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches further we depend on many vendors to support and assist our business which requires such vendors to generate store and use sensitive personal information 

cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our proprietary systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including terrorists nation states internal actors or third parties such as external service providers and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched for example there has been an increase in new financial fraud schemes akin to ransomware attacks on large companies whereby a cybercriminal installs a type of malicious software or malware that prevents a user or enterprise from accessing computer files systems or networks and demands payment of a ransom for their return those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers in addition while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services our vendors and in turn their own service providers may become subject to the same types of security breaches finally our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft misplaced or lost data human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers and clients data 

the costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers 

in addition the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers or other third parties could expose our customers and their private information to the risk of financial or medical identity theft unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy could also negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives such events could cause us to breach our contractual obligations and violate applicable laws these events would negatively affect our ability to compete others trust in us our reputation customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure requirements government investigations litigation and other enforcement proceedings material fines penalties or remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders and other adverse actions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

in managing medical practices and operating pharmacies onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense 

in addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services we employ physicians pharmacists nurses and other health care providers at our home delivery and specialty pharmacies onsite low acuity and primary care practices and infusion clinics that we manage and operate for our customers as well as certain clinics for our employees we also provide inhome care through health care providers that we employ as well as through thirdparty contractors as such we may be subject to liability for certain acts omissions or injuries caused by our employees or agents or occurring at one of these practices pharmacies or clinics the defense of any actions may require the diversion of personnel and other resources and the incurrence of significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

legal and compliance risks 

our business is subject to substantial government regulation as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and related interpretations are increasing in number and complexity are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or our thirdparty vendors could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

we must identify assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business there are currently pending and in the future there will likely be legislative or regulatory proposals which seek to manage the health services industry including managing prescription drug costs and health records as well as regulating drug distribution we expect federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system in addition changes to government policies not specifically targeted to the health services industry such as a change in tax laws and the corporate tax rate or government spending cuts could have significant impacts on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity the trading price of our securities may react to the announcement of such proposals as disclosed in part ii item 5 of this form 10k we have an active share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in 2021 proposed legislation was introduced in the united states senate which would if passed assess an excise tax on the amount spent by a publicly traded company on buying back its own stock we are unable to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted or the specific terms thereof including their effect on our operations however certain of these proposals could if enacted adversely impact our business and results of operations 

existing or future laws rules regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business affect the products and services we offer and where we offer them restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our costs including medical operating health care technology and administrative costs and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment for example invalidation modification repeal or replacement of the aca or portions thereof could result in material changes to the way we conduct our business as well as the loss of subsidies related to our ifp offerings we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to among other things market many of our products expand into additional geographic or product markets increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs existing or future laws and rules could also require or lead us to take other actions such as changing our business practices and could increase our liability further failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives such as by reducing 

operating costs adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

for more information on regulations affecting our business see business – regulation in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

there are various risks associated with participating in governmentsponsored programs such as medicare including dependence upon government funding compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight and enforcement 

through our us government business we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans additionally our evernorth business provides services to government entities and payers participating in government health care programs 

our revenues from government funded programs including our medicare programs and our government clients are dependent in whole or in part upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state or local governments funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available unanticipated changes in funding such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments or the failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability 

the medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans are established by contract although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors some of which are outside our control for example the base premium rate paid differs depending upon a combination of various factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region benefit mix member eligibility category and risk scores additionally a portion of each medicare advantage plans reimbursement is tied to the plans star rating with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for qualitybased bonus payments a plans star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform well are able to offer enhanced benefits market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater our medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans operating results premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership or impact our financial performance see the executive overview  key transactions and business developments section of mda in part ii item 7 of this form 10k for additional information on our star ratings 

additionally if we fail to comply with cms contractual requirements including data submission enrollment and marketing provider network adequacy provider directory accuracy quality measures claims payment continuity of care timely and accurate processing of appeals and grievances oversight of first tier downstream and related entities and call center performance we may be subject to administrative actions including enrollment sanctions or contract termination fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability as described under business – regulation in part i item 1 of this form 10k on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule that would revise its radv methodology and if adopted in its current form could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits higher monthly premiums or reduced choice for the population served by all medicare advantage insurers while it is uncertain whether cms will finalize the rule as proposed if adopted it could have a material impact on the companys future results of operations 

any failure or alleged failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs has resulted in and could in the future result in investigations or litigation such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws a successful action or claim against us could subject us to damage awards including treble damages fines penalties or other enforcement actions restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers limits on expansion restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies which could adversely impact our business cash flows financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we face risks related to litigation regulatory audits and investigations 

we are routinely involved in numerous claims lawsuits regulatory audits investigations and other legal matters arising for the most part in the ordinary course of business these legal matters could include benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims claims 

arising from consumer protection laws false claims act laws claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements employment and employment discriminationrelated suits antitrust claims employee benefit claims wage and hour claims tax privacy intellectual property and whistleblower claims shareholder suits and other securities law claims real estate disputes claims related to disclosure of certain business practices and claims arising from customer audits and contract performance including government contracts in addition we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business such as marketing misconduct failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care provider network structure poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions erisa claims allegations related to calculations of cost sharing and claims related to our administration of selffunded business we are also routinely involved in legal matters arising from our health services business including without limitation claims related to the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our home delivery and specialty pharmacies pharmacy benefit management services such as formulary management services health benefit management services and provider services there are currently and may be in the future attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and other companies in our industry individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry 

court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages may be sought we procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities however we also selfinsure a significant portion of our litigation risks while we maintain some thirdparty insurance coverage including excess liability insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers certain liabilities or types of damages such as punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded resolving disputes is often expensive and disruptive regardless of the outcome additionally it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices losses material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation 

we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare and pharmacy departments attorneys general doj cms dol and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions additionally we are and may in the future be subject to qui tam actions in which the government may or may not intervene with respect to our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plans compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments certain of our contracts are currently subject to radv audits by cms and the oig the doj is conducting industrywide investigations of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health services industry including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices and increased scrutiny by other federal and state governmental agencies such as state attorneys general empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings 

in addition various government agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pharmacy benefit management practices many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other companies being subject to civil penalties including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements we cannot predict what effect if any such government investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the industry in general however we will likely continue to experience government scrutiny and audit activity which has and may in the future result in civil penalties 

regulatory audits investigations or reviews or actions by other government agencies could result in changes to our business practices retroactive adjustments to certain premiums significant fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including corporate integrity agreements restrictions on our ability to participate in government programs market certain products or engage in businessrelated activities that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity in addition disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

a description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k the outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected 

most of our activities involve the receipt use storage or transmission of a substantial amount of individuals protected health information and personally identifiable information we also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes 

and in some cases provide access to such deidentified data or analytics created from such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators and analysts we may also use such information to create analytic models designed to predict and potentially improve outcomes and patient care the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients in some cases such laws rules regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements we are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information such as the gdpr can be more stringent than in the united states and they vary across jurisdictions in addition more jurisdictions are regulating the transfer of data across borders and domestic privacy and data protection laws are generally becoming more onerous 

these laws rules and contractual requirements are subject to change and the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding compliance with existing or new privacy security and data laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for more information on privacy regulations to which we are subject see business – regulation in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

hipaa requires covered entities to comply with the hipaa privacy security and breach rules in addition business associates must comply with the hipaa security and breach requirements while we endeavor to provide appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs administers an audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates in addition hhs continues to exercise its enforcement authority such as enforcement actions resulting from investigations brought on by notification to hhs of a breach an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows and reputation 

noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could materially adversely affect our business and reputation including our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

effective prevention detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change in addition ongoing vigorous law enforcement a highly technical regulatory scheme and the doddfrank act and related regulations enhance regulators enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources failure of our prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings fines and penalties 

in addition provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our selfinsured clients further during an economic downturn we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation 

economic risks 

economic and market conditions affect the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities investment income and interest expense 

as an insurer we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities and surplus requirements in our regulated companies the market values of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions with no offsetting change in the value of a portion of our liabilities a substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interestyielding debt securities of varying maturities and commercial mortgage loans the value of these investment assets can fluctuate 

significantly with changes in market conditions a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio increase interest expense on our indebtedness and increase investment income as investment assets mature and are replaced in addition an economic contraction could result in delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers reducing our investment income and requiring us to write down the value of our investments 

significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses 

we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans a significant decline in the value of the plans equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding this could reduce the cash available to us including our subsidiaries we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension obligations sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plans 

a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital 

financial strength claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future a downgrade of any of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth 

we maintain significant indebtedness in the ordinary course of business and may incur further indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt service costs leaving us with less cash flow from operations available to fund growth stock repurchases dividends and other corporate purposes 

the total indebtedness of cigna was approximately 337 billion as of december 31 2021 carrying indebtedness 

• requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our operations and growth strategy including investments acquisitions and capital expenditures make stock repurchases pay dividends and for general corporate purposes 

• increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions which may require us to dedicate an even greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt and limit our access to capital markets such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms 

• exposes us to increases in interest rates to the extent increased interest expense is not offset by increased income from our investment assets and 

• limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry 

the covenants in our debt instruments may have the effect among other things of restricting our financial and operating flexibility to respond to significant changes in business and economic conditions we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future which may subject us to additional restrictive covenants and increase the risks described above if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to seek additional dividends from our subsidiaries sell assets seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt 

unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

many factors including geopolitical issues future economic downturns manmade disasters natural disasters including those as a result of climate change and pandemics availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the us and global economies our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable 

economic conditions on our clients and customers both employers and individuals health care providers pharmacy manufacturers pharmacy providers and thirdparty vendors for example 

• employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us 

• higher unemployment rates employee attrition including challenges filling open positions in light of an increasingly competitive job market and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employerbased plans including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employerbased plans or our individual plans 

• because of unfavorable economic conditions or the aca employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 

• if clients are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us 

• our clients or potential clients may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 

• our clients may be acquired consolidated or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business or workforce which could reduce the number of customers we serve or otherwise result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services 

• a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers potentially increasing our medical costs 

• our thirdparty vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion 

• other insurers financial condition may be weakened increasing the risk that we will receive significant assessments for obligations of insolvent insurers pursuant to guaranty associations indemnity funds or other similar laws and regulations 

certain of the foregoing events have occurred and may continue to occur and the occurrence of these events may individually or in the aggregate lead to a decrease in our customer base revenues or margins or an increase in our operating costs 

in addition during and following a prolonged unfavorable economic environment federal and state budgets could be materially adversely affected resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in government programs such as medicare and social security or under contracts with government entities these budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers 

we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies primarily in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold under all reinsurance arrangements reinsurers assume insured losses subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit these arrangements also subject us to various obligations representations and warranties with the reinsurers reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies reinsurers may become financially unsound if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies 

the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

covid19 update 

cignas commitment to the health wellbeing and peace of mind of our employees and the people we serve remains the primary focus as the pandemic continues to impact all aspects of daily life cigna is leveraging its resources expertise data and actionable intelligence to assist customers clients and care providers navigate the evolving dynamics of the pandemic the company continues to encourage covid19 vaccinations across all eligible populations to help control the spread of the virus limit the severity of the disease and save lives cigna has also expanded access to testing care and supportive resources to help everyone it serves take care of their physical and mental health during this time and will continue to do so 

for the fourth quarter of 2021 our cigna healthcare segment reflected net unfavorable covid19 related impacts although not as significant when compared to those recognized in the same period in 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 the net unfavorable impacts reflect increased direct costs of covid19 testing treatment and vaccines as well as the significant deferral of care by our customers in 2020 these impacts were partially offset by the absence of the premium relief programs implemented in 2020 

we continue to optimize purchasing volume across the pharmaceutical supply chain in order to mitigate risk of disruption with prescription drug supply due to ongoing global supply disruptions 

the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid with continued uncertainty and a wide range of potential outcomes we continue to actively manage our response and assess impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as mitigate adverse developments in our business there continues to be uncertainty surrounding the pace duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic and its related impacts — including vaccination efforts and new covid19 variants including the delta and omicron variants — on our results for 2022 and beyond we believe that such financial results may continue to be impacted by among other things higher medical costs to treat those affected by the virus vaccinerelated costs test reimbursement costs lower risk adjustment revenue due to disrupted care impeding appropriate documentation of customer risk profiles in our medicare advantage plans the pace at which costs return as well as the severity of costs for those who had previously deferred care the potential for future deferral of care lower customer volumes due to a disrupted employment market or volatility in the economic markets

commentary 2021 versus 2020 

the commentary presented below and in the segment discussions that follow compare results for the year ended december 31 2021 with results for the year ended december 31 2020 

shareholders net income decreased reflecting the absence of the gain on sale of the group disability and life business reported in 2020 partially offset by higher adjusted income from operations 

adjusted income from operations increased primarily resulting from higher earnings in evernorth and lower net interest expense improved results in our international businesses held for sale reported in other operations also contributed to the increase these favorable effects were partially offset by lower earnings in cigna healthcare and the absence of earnings in 2021 from the sold group disability and life business the increase in earnings in the evernorth segment was primarily attributable to continued contract affordability improvements and business growth see evernorth segment section of this mda lower earnings in cigna healthcare were primarily driven by the unfavorable impacts of covid19 partially offset by higher net investment income see cigna healthcare segment section of this mda 

medical customers grew reflecting a higher customer base in individual and medicare advantage as well as our middle market select and international health market segments offset by a decline in customers in our national accounts market segment 

pharmacy revenues increased reflecting inflation on branded drugs and higher claim volume primarily due to our collaboration with prime therapeutics see the evernorth segment section of this mda for further discussion of pharmacy revenues 

premiums were lower reflecting the impact of the sale of the group disability and life business this effect was partially offset by an increase in cigna healthcare premiums resulting from customer growth in our insured businesses higher premium rates due to anticipated underlying medical cost trend and the absence of premium relief programs implemented in the second quarter of 2020 in response to deferred care due to the covid19 pandemic 

fees and other revenues increased primarily driven by customer growth see evernorth segment section of this mda 

net investment income increased due to strong returns on our securities limited partnership investments partially offset by lower average assets due to the sale of the group disability and life business see the investment assets section of this mda for further discussion 

pharmacy and other service costs increased reflecting inflation on branded drugs and higher claim volume primarily due to our collaboration with prime therapeutics 

medical costs and other benefit expenses increased resulting from higher medical costs in cigna healthcare primarily driven by net unfavorable covid19 related impacts underlying medical cost trend and customer growth in our insured business these unfavorable effects were substantially offset by the impact of the sale of the group disability and life business 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily reflecting the impact of the sale of the group disability and life business lower integration and transaction costs and the repeal of the health insurance industry tax these favorable effects were partially offset by expense growth in evernorth and cigna healthcare reflecting business growth 

interest expense and other decreased primarily due to a lower average interest rate and lower levels of average outstanding debt resulting from debt repayments 

debt extinguishment costs were lower because the debt repaid in 2021 had lower interest rates than the debt repaid in 2020 

realized investment results improved primarily due to gains on sales of real estate joint ventures in 2021 favorable market value adjustments on equity securities in 2021 compared with 2020 and lower credit loss reserves on debt securities these favorable effects were partially offset by lower gains on sales of debt securities in 2021 compared with 2020 

income tax expense decreased in 2021 reflecting the absence of taxes recorded in 2020 on the sale of the group disability and life business the consolidated effective tax rate decreased primarily driven by the repeal of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax in 2021 and the absence of incremental tax expense associated with the sale of the group disability and life business in 2020 

commentary 2020 vs 2019 

due to the segment changes made in 2021 the following commentary comparing consolidated 2020 results to 2019 is provided as an update to the commentary provided in our 2020 form 10k 

shareholders net income increased driven by the gain on sale of the group disability and life business lower amortization of acquired intangible assets and higher adjusted income from operations partially offset by the absence of earnings from transitioning clients 

adjusted income from operations increased driven in part by higher earnings in the evernorth segment reflecting customer growth and increased script volumes and lower interest costs in corporate due to a lower level of outstanding debt these favorable effects were partially offset by lower earnings from the sold group disability and life business reported in other operations primarily reflecting significantly elevated life claims related to the effects of covid19 

medical customers decreased due to declines in the middle market and national accounts market segments and increased disenrollment driven by the impacts of covid19 those decreases were partially offset by growth in the select and international health market segments as well as medicare advantage customers 

pharmacy revenues increased reflecting the transition of cigna healthcares customers to evernorth higher claims volumes driven by the evernorth collaboration with prime therapeutics and increased prices primarily due to inflation on branded drugs these factors were substantially offset by the absence of revenues from the transitioning clients and to a lesser extent an increase in the generic fill rate see the evernorth segment section of this mda for further discussion of pharmacy revenues 

premiums increased reflecting customer growth in insured products and rate increases reflecting expected medical cost inflation and the return of the health insurance industry tax these factors were partially offset by the impact of premium relief programs implemented in response to significantly lower than historical utilization as customers deferred care in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

fees and other revenues decreased primarily reflecting the transition of cigna healthcares commercial customers to evernorths retail pharmacy network beginning in the third quarter of 2019 see note 3j to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

net investment income decreased driven by lower yields including lower income from partnership investments due to current economic conditions these effects were partially offset by higher average assets 

pharmacy and other service costs increased reflecting the transition of cigna healthcares customers to evernorth higher claims volumes driven by the evernorth collaboration with prime therapeutics and an increase in pricing primarily due to inflation on branded drugs these factors were substantially offset by the impact of the absence of the transitioning clients and to a lesser extent continued contract affordability improvements and the favorable impact of the mix of claims 

medical costs and other benefit expenses increased reflecting both customer growth and direct costs associated with covid19 partially offset by care deferrals in insured products in cigna healthcare and higher life claims in the sold group disability and life business due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

selling general and administrative expenses were essentially flat primarily reflecting lower charges in 2020 for the 2019 organizational efficiency plan and resolving our affordable care act risk corridors claim against the united states federal government in the third quarter of 2020 these decreases were offset by the return of the health insurance industry tax 

amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased primarily reflecting lower amortization of customerrelated intangibles associated with the transitioning clients 

income tax expense increased for 2020 largely attributable to the sale of cignas group disability and life business the consolidated effective tax rate decreased slightly driven by recognition of certain incremental federal and state tax benefits largely offset by the return of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax 

key transactions and business developments 

organizational efficiency plan 

as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company approved a strategic plan to drive operational efficiencies we believe this plan coupled with the previously announced divestiture of the international life accident and supplemental health benefits businesses described below will further leverage the companys ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency through enhancements to organizational structure and increased use of automation and shared services in connection with these plans cigna has updated its reporting segments to align with the new business reporting structure and recognized a charge in the fourth quarter of 2021 in the amount of 168 million pretax 119 million aftertax we expect to realize annualized aftertax savings of approximately 180 million a substantial portion of the savings is expected to be realized in 2022 although a substantial portion of the actions associated with these strategic steps have been reflected in the charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 additional amounts are expected to be recorded in the second quarter of 2022 as we finalize our plans following the completion of the divestiture see note 15 for further information regarding our organizational efficiency charge

merger with express scripts 

cigna acquired express scripts on december 20 2018 costs related to this transaction are reported in integration and transactionrelated costs as a special item and excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of future underlying performance of the business the integration of this acquisition has been completed 

on january 30 2019 anthem inc anthem a former client of express scripts exercised its early termination right and terminated its pharmacy benefit management services agreement with us effective march 1 2019 there was a twelvemonth transition period that ended march 1 2020 we excluded the results of express scripts contract with anthem and also coventry health care inc from our nongaap reporting metrics adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations for 2019 and refer to these clients as transitioning clients as of december 31 2019 the transition was substantially complete therefore beginning in 2020 we no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our reported adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations additionally for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded an adjustment related to this contract that was excluded from adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations 

medicare star quality ratings star ratings

liquidity and capital resources 



liquidity 

we maintain liquidity at two levels the subsidiary level and the parent company level 

cash requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of 

• pharmacy medical costs and other benefit payments 

• expense requirements primarily for employee compensation and benefits information technology and facilities costs 

• income taxes and 

• debt service 

our subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by 

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

• using cash flows from operating activities 

• matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities 

• selling investments and 

• borrowing from affiliates subject to applicable regulatory limits 

cash requirements at the parent company level generally consist of 

• debt service 

• payment of declared dividends to shareholders 

• lending to subsidiaries as needed and 

• pension plan funding 

the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by 

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments 

• collecting dividends from its subsidiaries 

• using proceeds from issuing debt and common stock and 

• borrowing from its subsidiaries subject to applicable regulatory limits 

dividends from our insurance health maintenance organization hmo and certain foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information regarding these restrictions most of the evernorth segment operations are not subject to regulatory restrictions regarding dividends and therefore provide significant financial flexibility to cigna 

cash flows for the years ended december 31 were as follows 



the following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with the year ended december 31 2020 for comparisons of liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 please refer to the previously filed mda included in part ii item 7 of our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs premiums fees investment income taxes benefit costs and other expenses 

cash provided by operating activities decreased driven by increases in accounts receivable due to higher pharmacy claim volume and business growth and a delay in the annual cms part d settlement the timing of pharmacy and other service cost payables as well as higher tax payments largely related to the sale of the group disability and life business these decreases were partially offset by the absence of the health insurance industry tax payments 

investing and financing activities 

cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to the acquisition of mdlive in 2021 the absence of the net proceeds from the sale of the group disability and life business in 2020 partially offset by lower net investment activities 

cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to lower debt repayments offset by higher stock repurchases including shares purchased pursuant to the asr agreements described below and an increase in dividends paid 

capital resources 

our capital resources consist primarily of cash cash equivalents and investments maintained at regulated subsidiaries required to underwrite insurance risks cash flows from operating activities our commercial paper program credit agreements and the issuance of longterm debt and equity securities our businesses generate significant cash flow from operations some of which is subject to regulatory restrictions relative to the amount and timing of dividend payments to the parent company dividends from us regulated subsidiaries were 28 billion and 23 billion for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively nonregulated subsidiaries also generate significant cash flow from operating activities which is typically available immediately to the parent company for general corporate purposes 

we prioritize our use of capital resources to 

• invest in capital expenditures primarily related to technology to support innovative solutions for our customers provide the capital necessary to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to repay debt and fund pension obligations if necessary 

• pay dividends to shareholders 

• consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous and 

• return capital to shareholders through share repurchases 

funds available

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our credit agreements and commercial paper program 

at december 31 2021 our debttocapitalization ratio was 417 an increase from 395 at december 31 2020 reflecting higher commercial paper balances and the impact of share repurchase on shareholders equity 

we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy 

subsidiary borrowings in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above the parent company can borrow an additional 20 billion from its subsidiaries without further approvals as of december 31 2021 

use of capital resources 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures for property equipment and computer software were 12 billion in 2021 compared to 11 billion in 2020 we expect to continue to invest in technology that we believe will drive future growth anticipated capital expenditures will be funded primarily from operating cash flow

management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented in this form 10k we regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates 

in addition to the estimates presented in the following tables the notes to the consolidated financial statements describe other estimates that management has made in preparation of the financial statements management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition the tables below present the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of 

operations liquidity or financial condition except for assessing impairment of goodwill 







segment reporting 

the following section of this mda discusses the results of each of our segments 

cigna entered into a definitive agreement in october 2021 to sell its life accident and supplemental benefits businesses in seven countries to chubb for 575 billion cash in connection with the pending chubb transaction we revised our business reporting structure as such we adjusted our segment reporting effective in the fourth quarter of 2021 so that the results previously reported in the international markets segment are now reported as follows 

• the businesses to be retained by cigna are now reported in the newly created international health operating segment that will be aggregated with our existing us commercial and us government operating segments in the renamed cigna healthcare reporting segment previously named us medical 

• the businesses to be sold pursuant to the chubb transaction are now reported in other operations 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of our segments 

in segment discussions we present adjusted revenues and pretax adjusted income loss from operations defined as income loss before income taxes excluding net realized investment results amortization of acquired intangible assets results of transitioning clients prior to 2020 and special items cignas share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the cigna healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as adjusted revenues and pretax adjusted income loss from operations see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to pretax adjusted income from operations as well as a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues note 23 to the consolidated financial statements also explains that segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in corporate 

in these segment discussions we also present pretax adjusted margin defined as pretax adjusted income loss from operations divided by adjusted revenues 

see the executive overview section of this mda for summarized financial results of each of our segments 

evernorth segment 

evernorth includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services and capabilities as well as those from partners across the healthcare system in pharmacy solutions benefits management solutions care delivery and care management solutions and intelligence solutions as described in the introduction to segment reporting evernorths performance is measured using adjusted revenues and pretax adjusted income from operations 

the key factors that impact evernorths pharmacy revenues and pharmacy and other service costs are volume mix of claims and price these key factors are discussed further below see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment 

• as our clients claim volumes increase or decrease our resulting revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly increase or decrease our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of changes in purchasing discounts 

• the mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling types of drugs can have an impact on our pharmacy revenues pharmacy and other service costs and gross profit including amounts payable under certain financial and performance guarantees with our clients in addition to the types of drugs the mix of generic claims ie generic fill rate also impacts our gross profit generally higher generic fill rates reduce revenues as generic drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace however as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients higher generic fill rates generally have a favorable impact on our gross profit the home delivery generic fill rate is currently lower than the network generic fill rate as fewer generic substitutions are available among maintenance medications such as therapies for chronic conditions commonly dispensed from home delivery pharmacies as compared to acute medications that are primarily dispensed by pharmacies in our retail networks furthermore our gross profit differs among network home delivery and specialty distribution methods and can impact our profitability 

• our client contract pricing is impacted by our ongoing ability to negotiate favorable contracts for pharmacy network pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates as we seek to improve the effectiveness of our 

integrated solutions for the benefit of our clients we are continuously innovating and improving affordability our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of drug purchasing contract initiatives implemented inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals therefore the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients continues to be a significant driver of our revenues and cost of revenues in the current environment 

in this mda we present revenues and gross profit as well as adjusted revenues and adjusted gross profit consistent with our segment reporting metrics which exclude special items and for periods prior to 2020 contributions from transitioning clients as of december 31 2019 the transition of these clients was substantially complete therefore beginning in 2020 we no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our adjusted metrics additionally for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded an adjustment related to a former client contract that was excluded from our adjusted metrics see the key transactions and business developments section of this form 10k mda for further discussion of transitioning clients and why we present this information 

results of operations 



1 amounts exclude special items and for periods prior to 2020 contributions from transition clients for the year ended december 31 2019 

2 adjusted expense ratio is calculated as selling general and administrative expense excluding contributions from transition clients for the year ended december 31 2019 as a percentage of adjusted revenues 

3 nonspecialty network scripts filled through 90day programs and home delivery scripts are multiplied by three all other network and specialty scripts are counted as one script 

4 generic fill rate is defined as the total number of generic scripts divided by the total overall scripts filled 

2021 versus 2020 

adjusted network revenues increased reflecting increased prices due to inflation on branded drugs and higher claims volume primarily due to our collaboration with prime therapeutics these increases were partially offset by claims mix due to an increase in the generic fill rate after excluding the impact of covid19 vaccines 

adjusted home delivery and specialty revenues increased reflecting higher specialty claims volume due in part to our collaboration with prime therapeutics as well as increased prices primarily due to inflation on branded drugs these increases were partially offset by slightly lower home delivery claims volume 

other pharmacy revenues increased reflecting higher volume from our curascript specialty distribution business 

adjusted fees and other revenues increased reflecting customer growth from our services supporting benefits management solutions including customer growth from certain fee based contractual arrangements and the acquisition of mdlive 

adjusted gross profit and pretax adjusted income from operations increased reflecting continued contract affordability improvements and business growth pretax adjusted income from operations increase was partially offset by strategic investments in expanding partnerships new businesses and solutions and digital technology 

the expense ratio was flat reflecting higher revenues as well as increased strategic investments in expanding partnerships new businesses and solutions and digital technology in the year ended december 31 2021 offset by increased operating expenses due to client transitions in the year ended december 31 2020 

2020 versus 2019 

in the first quarter of 2020 us government operating segment customers transitioned to express scripts retail pharmacy network in the third quarter of 2019 us commercial operating segment customers transitioned to express scripts retail pharmacy network 

adjusted network revenues increased reflecting the transition of cigna healthcares customers higher claims volume due to our collaboration with prime therapeutics and increased prices due to inflation on branded drugs these favorable effects were partially offset by claims mix due to the increase in the generic fill rate 

adjusted home delivery and specialty revenues increased reflecting higher prices due to inflation on branded drugs and higher home delivery and specialty claims volume these increases were partially offset by claims mix due to an increase in the generic fill rate 

adjusted gross profit and pretax adjusted income from operations increased reflecting customer growth higher adjusted pharmacy scripts volumes continued contract affordability improvements and the favorable impact of claims mix as a result of the types of drugs dispensed the distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling and an increase in the generic fill rate pretax adjusted income from operations increase was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses due to client transitions 

the expense ratio was lower reflecting higher revenues and increased operating expenses due to client transitions 

cigna healthcare segment 

cigna healthcare includes cignas us commercial us government and international health businesses which provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers to support wholeperson health needs us commercial products and services include medical pharmacy behavioral health dental vision health advocacy programs and other products and services for insured and selfinsured customers us government solutions include medicare advantage medicare supplement and medicare part d plans for seniors and individual health insurance plans both on and off the public exchanges international health solutions include health care coverage in our international markets as well as health care benefits for globally mobile individuals and employees of multinational organization the cigna healthcare segment is comprised of the previously named us medical segment and the businesses to be retained from the previous international markets segment the addition of international health to the cigna healthcare segment did not have a material impact on the business drivers which contributed to changes in results of operations when comparing 2020 to 2019 as described in the introduction to segment reporting performance of the cigna healthcare segment is measured using adjusted revenues and pretax adjusted income from operations key factors affecting results for this segment include 

• customer growth 

• revenue growth 

• percentage of medicare advantage customers in plans eligible for quality bonus payments 

• medical costs as a percentage of premiums medical care ratio or mcr for our insured businesses and 

• selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of adjusted revenues expense ratio 

results of operations 

2021 versus 2020 

adjusted revenues increased reflecting medicare advantage and individual customer growth higher premium rates due to anticipated underlying medical cost trend higher net investment income and the absence of the 2020 premium relief programs for clients implemented in response to significantly lower than historical utilization as individuals deferred care due to the covid19 pandemic 

pretax adjusted income from operations decreased due to increased utilization of health care services by our customers including increased direct costs of covid19 testing treatment and vaccines partially offset by higher net investment income increased specialty contributions the absence of the premium relief programs and the repeal of the health insurance industry tax the impacts of covid19 remain uncertain and could vary significantly as discussed in the covid19 update section of this mda 

the medical care ratio increased due to increased utilization of health care services by our customers including increased direct costs of covid19 testing treatment and vaccines as well as the repeal of the health insurance industry tax partially offset by the absence of the premium relief programs 

the expense ratio decreased reflecting increased revenues the repeal of the health insurance industry tax favorable litigation developments and efficiencies from continued disciplined expense management 

2020 versus 2019 

adjusted revenues increased reflecting medicare advantage and us commercial insured customer growth as well as higher premium rates due to anticipated underlying medical cost trend and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax these favorable effects were partially offset by the impact of 2020 premium relief programs for clients implemented in response to significantly lower than historical utilization as individuals deferred care due to the covid19 pandemic 

pretax adjusted income from operations increased reflecting net favorable covid19 related impacts as well as us commercial insured and medicare advantage customer growth partially offset by the resumption of the health insurance industry tax and less favorable prior period development covid19 related impacts include deferral of care by our customers partially offset by direct covid19 costs costs of actions we have taken to support customers providers and employees and increased disenrollment resulting from the economic impacts of the pandemic 

the medical care ratio decreased driven by covid19 related impacts and the pricing effect of the health insurance industry tax covid19 related impacts include deferral of care by our customers partially offset by direct covid19 costs and premium relief programs extended to employer clients 

the expense ratio was flat reflecting higher insured revenues as well as efficiencies from continued disciplined expense management and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax 

medical customers 

a medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria 

• is covered under a medical insurance policy managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us 

• has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan or 

• has medical claims that are administered by us 



1 international health excludes medical customers served by less than 100 owned subsidiaries and customers that are part of the businesses to be sold pursuant to the chubb transaction 

2021 versus 2020 

our medical customer base increased at december 31 2021 compared with december 31 2020 reflecting a higher customer base in our middle market select and international health segments as well as our individual business and medicare advantage plans partially offset by a lower customer base in our national segment 

2020 versus 2019 

our medical customer base decreased at december 31 2020 compared with december 31 2019 reflecting a lower customer base in our middle market and national accounts segments and increased disenrollment resulting from the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by growth in our select segment medicare advantage plans and international health 

unpaid claims and claim expenses 

2021 versus 2020 

our unpaid claims and claim expenses liability was higher as of december 31 2021 compared with december 31 2020 primarily due to medicare advantage and individual customer growth and increased claim volumes 

2 020 versus 2019 

our unpaid claims and claim expenses liability was higher as of december 21 2020 compared with december 31 2019 primarily due to medicare advantage and us commercial insured customer growth 

other operations 

for 2021 2020 and 2019 other operations includes international businesses to be sold corporate owned life insurance coli and the companys runoff operations prior to the sale of the group disability and life business on december 31 2020 other operations also included cignas group disability and life business which offered group longterm and shortterm disability and group life accident voluntary and specialty insurance products and services other operations was previously named group 

disability and other as described in the introduction of segment reporting performance of other operations is measured using adjusted revenues and pretax adjusted income from operations 

results of operations 

2021 versus 2020 

adjusted revenues decreased due to the sale of the group disability and life business on december 31 2020 because the sold business constituted a significant portion of other operations adjusted revenues substantially declined in 2021 compared to 2020 

pretax adjusted income from operations also declined due to the sale of the group disability and life insurance business that decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings from the international businesses held for sale 

2020 versus 2019 

adjusted revenues increased reflecting business growth in the international businesses held for sale and the sold group disability and life business partially offsetting those favorable effects were lower net investment income in the sold group disability and life business and unfavorable foreign currency movements in the international businesses held for sale 

pretax adjusted income from operations decreased due to lower earnings in the sold group disability and life business reflecting unfavorable life claims experience related to the covid19 pandemic unfavorable disability claim experience and lower investment income partially offset by favorable results in the voluntary products those unfavorable effects were partially offset by improved earnings in the international businesses held for sale reflecting improved margin and business growth 

other items related to international businesses subject to definitive purchase agreement 

for the year ended december 31 2021 86 of the segments adjusted revenues and 89 of the segments pretax adjusted income from operations was associated with international businesses held for sale 

corporate 

corporate reflects amounts not allocated to operating segments including net interest expense defined as interest on corporate debt less net investment income on investments not supporting segment and other operations certain litigation matters expense associated with our frozen pension plans charitable contributions severance certain overhead and enterprisewide project costs and intersegment eliminations for products and services sold between segments 

2021 versus 2020 

pretax adjusted loss from operations was lower primarily reflecting lower interest expense due to a lower average interest rate and lower levels of outstanding debt resulting from debt repayments 

2 020 versus 2019 

pretax adjusted loss from operations was lower primarily reflecting lower interest expense due to lower levels of debt 

investment assets 

the following table presents our investment asset portfolio excluding separate account assets as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 additional information regarding our investment assets is included in notes 11 12 13 and 14 to the consolidated 

financial statements for comparisons of investment assets portfolio excluding separate account assets as of december 31 2020 compared with december 31 2019 please refer to the previously filed mda included in part ii item 7 of our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

1 investments related to the international life accident and supplemental benefits businesses that are held for sale see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

debt securities 

investments in debt securities include publiclytraded and privatelyplaced bonds mortgage and other assetbacked securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on our balance sheet additional information regarding valuation methodologies key inputs and controls is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements more detailed information about debt securities by type of issuer and maturity dates is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table reflects our portfolio of debt securities by type of issuer as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 

our debt securities portfolio decreased during 2021 reflecting a decrease in valuations due to increasing yields and net sale activity 

as of december 31 2021 147 billion or 87 of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade baa and above or equivalent and the remaining 23 billion were below investment grade the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the noninvestment grade spectrum these quality characteristics have not materially changed since the prior year and remain consistent with our investment strategy 

debt securities include private placement assets of 58 billion these investments are generally less marketable than publiclytraded bonds however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publiclytraded bonds with comparable credit risk we perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions if warranted 

investments in debt securities are diversified by issuer geography and industry on an aggregate basis the debt securities portfolio continues to perform according to original investment expectations however due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic there are certain issuers particularly within the aviation energy and hospitality sectors that have shown signs of distress primarily in the form of requests for temporary covenant relief there were no material unrealized losses in any of these sectors as of the reporting date we continue to monitor the economic environment and its effect on our portfolio and consider the impact of various factors in determinin g the allowance for credit losses on debt securities which is discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign government obligations are concentrated in asia primarily south korea and taiwan consistent with our risk management practice and local regulatory requirements of our international business operations we expect the amount of these foreign government 

obligations to decrease significantly during 2022 upon the close of our sale of certain international businesses as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

commercial mortgage loans 

as of december 31 2021 the 16 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 50 loans that are in good standing our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans diversified by property type location and borrower given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash invested in the property generally ranging between 30 and 40 we remain confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms for further discussion of the results and changes in key loan metrics see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

loans are secured by high quality commercial properties located in strong institutional markets and are generally made at less than 65 of the propertys value at origination of the loan property value debt service coverage quality building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans 

our annual indepth review of our commercial mortgage loan investments is the primary mechanism for monitoring the overall quality rating of the mortgage portfolio we completed the annual indepth review in the second quarter of 2021 which included an analysis of each underlying propertys most recent annual financial statements rent rolls and operating plans as well as a physical inspection of the property and a review of applicable market reports the results of this annual review confirmed that the overall credit quality of our portfolio remains strong and was generally in line with the previous years results 

covid19 has negatively impacted commercial real estate fundamentals and capital market activity with concentrated weakness in hotels and regional malls our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified by property type and geography with no material exposure to hotels and no exposure to regional shopping malls we continue to monitor the longterm impacts surrounding the office sector fundamentals due to multiple headwinds that may impact future valuations expanded work from home flexibility shorter term leases elevated tenant improvement allowances and corporate migration to lower cost states our mortgage loans secured by office properties are in good standing 

other longterm investments 

other longterm investments of 36 billion as of december 31 2021 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships direct investments in real estate joint ventures and other deposit activity that is required to support various insurance and health services businesses the increase in other longterm investments of 07 billion since december 31 2020 is primarily driven by net additional funding activity and value creation in the underlying investments these limited partnership entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privatelyheld companies and equity real estate given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns to mitigate risk these investments are diversified across approximately 210 separate partnerships and approximately 110 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships also the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region no single partnership investment exceeded 4 of our securities and real estate limited partnership portfolio 

income from our limited partnership investments is generally reported on a one quarter lag due to the timing of when financial information is received from the general partner or manager of the investments our net investment income increased significantly versus 2020 driven by the strong performance of assets underlying our limited partnership investments the broad recovery since the beginning of the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic has resulted in strong corporate earnings and higher public and private asset valuations we expect continued volatility in private equity and real estate fund performance going forward as fair market valuations are adjusted to reflect market and portfolio transactions 

we participate in an insurance joint venture in china with a 50 ownership interest we account for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting and report our share of the net assets of 10 billion in other assets our 50 share of the investment portfolio supporting the joint ventures liabilities is approximately 84 billion as of december 31 2021 these investments were comprised of approximately 75 debt securities including government and corporate debt diversified by issuer industry and geography 15 equities including mutual funds equity securities and private equity partnerships and 10 longterm deposits and policy loans approximately 1 of the joint ventures investment assets are exposed to private real estate property developers in the china market we participate in the approval of the joint ventures investment strategy and continuously review its execution there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31 2021 

investment outlook 

we continue to actively monitor the economic impact of the pandemic including supply chain labor market and inflation dynamics as well as fiscal and monetary responses and their potential impact on the portfolio future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date these future conditions are not reasonably predictable however we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the longterm although future declines in investment fair values resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investmentspecific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

market risk 

financial instruments 

our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices consistent with disclosure requirements the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments 

• changes in the fair values of insurancerelated assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk 

• changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets and 

• changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill deferred policy acquisition costs taxes and various accrued liabilities because they are not financial instruments their primary risks are other than market risk 

excluding these items our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are 

• interestrate risk on fixedrate mediumterm instruments changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return 

• foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar net of derivatives used for hedging is primarily to the chinese yuan renminbi and south korean won an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 

our management of market risks 

we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk 

• investmentliability matching we generally select investment assets with characteristics such as duration yield currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations shorterterm investments generally support shorterterm life and health liabilities mediumterm fixedrate investments support interestsensitive and health liabilities longerterm investments generally support products with longer payout periods such as annuities 

• use of local currencies for foreign operations  we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies this technique limits exchange rate risk to our net assets 

• use of derivatives we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our primary market risks see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments 

effect of market fluctuations 

assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and 10 strengthening in the us dollar to foreign currencies the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities would have been as follows as of december 31 

the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates primarily on debt securities and commercial mortgage loans was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models primarily duration modeling 

in the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the fair value of the companys longterm debt would decrease approximately 29 billion at december 31 2021 and 30 billion at december 31 2020 changes in the fair value of our longterm debt do not impact our financial position or operating results see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the companys debt 

the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10 of the fair value of these instruments translated to the us dollar our foreign operations hold investment assets such as debt securities cash and cash equivalents that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities

• the company is not dependent on business from one or a few brokers or agents in addition our insurance businesses are generally not committed to accept a fixed portion of the business submitted by independent brokers and agents and generally all such business is subject to approval and acceptance 

regulation 



the laws and regulations governing our business continue to increase each year and are subject to frequent change we are regulated by federal state and international legislative bodies and agencies which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact the health care system we expect continued legislative and regulatory debate of issues related to our businesses as has become increasingly common with public policy reforms in the health services industry executive judicial or legislative intervention could alter slow or eliminate the impact of any proposal following the related regulation’s promulgation including for example the executive order issued in january 2021 regarding a regulatory freeze pending review which may delay or ultimately result in revision or repeal of various regulatory actions taken in 2020 

many aspects of our business are directly regulated by federal and state laws and administrative agencies such as the department of health and human services “hhs” centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the internal revenue service “irs” the us departments of labor “dol” treasury and justice “doj” the office of personnel management “opm” the federal trade commission “ftc” the us securities and exchange commission “sec” the office of the national coordinator for health information technology “onc” state departments of insurance and state boards of pharmacy our business practices may also be shaped by judicial decisions 

in addition aspects of our business are subject to indirect regulation the selffunded benefit plans sponsored by our us employer clients are regulated under federal law these selffunded clients expect us to ensure that our administration of their plans complies with the regulatory requirements applicable to them 

our business operations and the books and records of our regulated businesses are routinely subject to examination and audit at regular intervals by state insurance and hmo regulatory agencies state boards of pharmacy cms dol irs opm and comparable international regulators to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations our operations are also subject to nonroutine examinations audits and investigations by various state and federal regulatory agencies generally as the result of a complaint in addition we may be implicated in investigations of our clients whose group benefit plans we administer on their behalf as a result we routinely receive subpoenas and other demands or requests for information from various state insurance and hmo regulatory agencies state attorneys general the hhs office of inspector general “hhsoig” the doj the dol and other state federal and international authorities we may also be called upon by members of the us congress to provide information including testifying before congressional committees and subcommittees regarding certain of our business practices if cigna is determined to have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations these examinations audits investigations reviews subpoenas and demands may 

• result in fines penalties injunctions consent orders or loss of licensure 

• suspend or exclude from participation in government programs or limit our ability to sell or market our products 

• require changes in business practices 

• damage relationships with the agencies that regulate us and affect our ability to secure regulatory approvals necessary for the operation of our business or 

• damage our brand and reputation 

our international subsidiaries are subject to regulations in international jurisdictions including in certain cases many regulations similar to the federal and state regulations described below which are complex and where foreign insurers may face more rigorous regulations than their domestic competitors and may also be affected by geopolitical developments or tensions 

the laws and regulations governing our business as well as the related interpretations are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other changes in our business environment are likely to continue as elected and appointed officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to existing laws and regulations even 

where we believe that we are in compliance with the various laws and regulations any enforcement actions by federal state or international government officials alleging noncompliance with these rules and regulations could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with these laws and regulations see the risk factors section located in part i item 1a of this form 10k management continues to be actively engaged with regulators and policymakers with respect to legislation and rulemaking 

covid19related regulatory actions 

in response to covid19 which was declared a pandemic by the world health organization in early 2020 us federal and state governments have increasingly enacted new legislative and regulatory requirements as well as provided flexibility to industry participants within existing legal requirements these regulatory actions primarily provide for 

• client and customer premium relief to avoid the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies 

• mandating or requesting waiver of customer costsharing and other related costs such as covid19 testing or treatment as well as establishing provider reimbursement and vaccine immunizations coverage requirements 

• extending claims filing deadlines for providers customers and facilities 

• mandating or encouraging waiver of customer costshare related to telemedicine services as well as requiring certain reimbursement levels for telemedicine providers to encourage its utilization 

• increasing the medicare feeforservice reimbursement for certain items and services 

• enacting coverage and reimbursement requirements at innetwork levels for certain services received from outofnetwork providers 

• clarification regarding permissible sharing of information and coordination among health care providers 

• revising or suspending the use of certain medical management procedures and 

• mandating prescription drug benefit administration requirements primarily related to formulary exceptions and restrictions and prior authorization and prescription drug refill limits 

these actions are in effect for various durations but generally track the different states of emergency that have been declared at the state and federal level of particular significance is the public health emergency declared by the secretary of hhs on january 31 2020 which sets the effective period for certain of the requirements established through federal covid19 legislation such as covering testing without cost sharing 

patient protection and the affordable care act 

the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” mandated broad changes to the us health care system including insured and selfinsured health benefit plans and pharmacy benefit managers our business model is impacted by the aca including our relationships with current and future producers and health care providers products service providers and technologies the provisions of the aca imposed among other things certain assessments on health insurers created health insurance exchanges for individuals and small group employers to purchase insurance coverage and implemented minimum medical loss ratios “mlrs” for our medicare and commercial businesses certain states have adopted mlr requirements applicable to our commercial businesses that are more stringent than those established by the aca other provisions of the aca in effect include reduced medicare advantage payment rates the requirement to cover preventive services with no enrollee costsharing banning the use of lifetime and annual limits on the dollar amount of essential health benefits increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage extending coverage of dependents up to age 26 restrictions on differential pricing enforcement mechanisms and rules related to health care fraud and abuse enforcement activities and certain pharmacy benefit transparency requirements the employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more fulltime employees to offer affordable health insurance that provides minimum value each as defined under the aca to fulltime employees and their dependents including children up to age 26 or be subject to penalties based on employer size the aca also changed certain tax laws to effectively limit tax deductions for certain employee compensation paid by health insurers in december 2019 the federal government repealed the nondeductible health insurance industry fee effective for 2021 as well as repealing the enacted but never implemented 40 excise tax on certain employersponsored coverage known as the “cadillac tax” and the medical device tax 

in 2018 the dol issued final rules that revised the definition of “employer” under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” to make it easier for employers including selfemployed individuals to form bona fide employer groups all of whose employees would be counted in determining whether they were small or large groups for purposes of the aca while the regulation of these groupings by state insurance departments is not affected by the dol’s final association health plan rules the final rules have resulted in an increase in interest among employers associations producers and benefit consultants in forming new groupings for purposes of offering insured or selffunded group health plans 

since its adoption there have been several attempts to repeal or limit the utility of the aca certain insurers including cigna have sued the federal government for failure to pay costsharing subsidies “csr” under the aca in the first set of consolidated appeals the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision on august 14 2020 finding that i the csr reimbursement provision of the aca imposes an obligation on the government to pay but ii the insurers’ damages must be reduced by the amount of additional premium tax credit payments that each insurer received as a result of the government’s termination of csr payments our premium rates for the 2018 2019 and 2020 plan years reflected a lack of government funding for costsharing reduction subsidies the insurers filed petitions for rehearing en banc in the federal circuit and the court denied those petitions on february 19 2021 two insurers filed a petition seeking us supreme court review the matter remains unresolved and our case is stayed pending final resolution of the consolidated appeals including the petition for writ of certiorari in the u s supreme court in december 2017 us tax reform legislation was signed into law that among other things reduced the “individual mandate” penalty for individuals without health insurance to zero dollars effective january 1 2019 as a result of this change a federal district court has ruled that the “individual mandate” is unconstitutional and that the entire law must be struck down on appeal the court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed that the “individual mandate” is unconstitutional but ordered the district court to reexamine whether the other provisions of the aca can remain in effect the californialed states and the us house of representatives filed petitions seeking to appeal the fifth circuits ruling to the us supreme court the us supreme court heard oral arguments on the appeals on november 10 2020 and a decision is expected by the end of june 2021

medicare and medicaid regulations 

through our subsidiaries we offer individual and group medicare advantage medicare prescription drug “part d” and medicare supplement products we also provide medicare part drelated products and services to other medicare part d sponsors medicare advantage prescription drug plans and employers and clients offering medicare part d benefits to medicare part d eligible beneficiaries as part of our medicare advantage and medicare part d business we contract with cms to provide services to medicare beneficiaries as a result our ability to obtain payment and the determination of the amount of such payments market to enroll and retain customers and expand into new service areas is subject to compliance with cms’ numerous and complex regulations and requirements that are frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion review and enforcement we offer medicaid and dualeligible products and participate in state medicaid programs directly or indirectly through our clients who are medicaid managed care contractors we also perform certain medicaid subrogation services and certain delegated services including utilization management for clients which are regulated by federal and state laws our medicaid and dualeligible products are regulated by cms and state medicaid agencies audit our performance to determine compliance with contracts and regulations 

cms evaluates medicare advantage plans and part d plans under its “star rating” system the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including for example quality of care preventive services chronic illness management coverage determinations and appeals and customer satisfaction a plan’s star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform very well are able to offer enhanced benefits and market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans medicare advantage plans’ qualitybonus payments are determined by the star rating with plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for such payments the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve and maintain four stars or greater for example beginning with star ratings for payment year 2024 cms will place more emphasis on patient experience surveybased measures which could reduce star ratings predictability year over year additionally as a result of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on 2020 care patterns and utilization cms finalized rules applying relief to medicare advantage and part d plan star ratings for payment year 2023 by utilizing the higher of the payment year 2023 or 2022 measure level star ratings 

cms uses a riskadjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to customers’ health status the riskadjustment model generally pays more where a plans membership is expected to have increased costs because of the health status of its members under this model rates paid to medicare advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard medicarecovered benefits to an enrollee with a “national average risk profile” that baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership under the riskadjustment methodology medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines we generally rely on providers including certain providers who are employees to appropriately document their claims and other submissions with appropriate diagnoses from which we extract hierarchical condition codes to submit to cms as the basis for our payments received under the actuarial riskadjustment model the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to the plans which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government feeforservice program in 2012 cms released a payment methodology that provided for sample audit error rates to be 

extrapolated to the entire medicare advantage contract after comparing audit results with a similar audit of medicare fee for service the “ffs adjuster” and applying an ffs adjuster to establish actuarial equivalency in payment rates as required by the medicare statute however a methodology to calculate the ffs adjuster was not finalized and cms has to date not completed any risk adjustment data validation “radv” audits using extrapolation 

on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule titled “proposed rule on changes to ma and part d programs for cy 2020 and 2021” that would revise its radv methodology for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years by among other things extrapolating the error rate related to radv audit findings without applying the ffs adjuster if the proposed rule is adopted in its current form it could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits higher monthly premiums and reduced choice for the population served by all ma insurers the company along with other medicare advantage organizations and additional interested parties submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process the comment period concluded on august 28 2019 and cms is expected to act by november 2021 radv audits for our contract years 2011 through 2015 are currently in process it is uncertain whether cms will finalize the rule as proposed see below under “federal and state oversight of governmentsponsored health care programs” for a discussion of radv audits 

coverage of prescription drugs under medicare part d is also regulated by cms and our contracts with cms contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk these provisions affect our ultimate payments from cms for example premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor payments which compare costs targeted in our annual bids with actual prescription costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the payments we received known as a risk corridor 

we expect cms hhsoig doj and other federal agencies to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the medicare advantage program and modify the terms and requirements of the program noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant consequences including fines and penalties enrollment sanctions exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs limitations on expansion and criminal penalties 

false claims act and antikickback laws 

our products and services are also subject to the federal false claims act the “false claims act” and federal and state antikickback laws additionally the federal government has made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks in return for customer referrals billing for unnecessary medical services upcoding and improper marketing the regulations and contractual requirements in this area are complex frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion and judicial interpretation 

false claims act and related criminal provisions the false claims act imposes civil penalties on any person who makes or causes to be made claims or records or statements that he or she knows or should know are false with respect to governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid to obtain reimbursement or for failure to return overpayments private individuals may bring qui tam or “whistleblower” suits against providers under the false claims act which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit the aca amended the federal antikickback laws to state any claim submitted to a federal or state health care program that violates the antikickback laws is also a false claim under the false claims act the false claims act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages creating the possibility of substantial financial liabilities criminal statutes similar to the false claims act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement it knows to be false fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency the corporation may be fined conviction under these statutes may also result in exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs many states have also enacted laws similar to the false claims act some of which may include criminal penalties substantial fines and treble damages 

antikickback and referral laws subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” the federal antikickback statute generally prohibits among other things knowingly and willfully paying receiving or offering any payment or other remuneration to induce a person to purchase lease order or arrange for items including prescription drugs or services reimbursable in whole or in part under medicare medicaid or another federal health care program many states have similar laws some of which are not limited to items or services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antikickback laws may include criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs 

antikickback laws have been cited as a partial basis along with state consumer protection laws described below for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies or payors in connection with “product conversion” or promotion programs other antikickback and referral laws may also be applicable including criminal and 

civil laws restricting illegal kickbacks and conflicts of interest in connection with an erisa plan the federal “stark law” and various state antikickback restrictions 

in november 2020 hhs and hhsoig released a final rule which eliminates an antikickback regulatory safe harbor protection for price concessions including rebates that are offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors or pharmacy benefit managers under the medicare part d program the final rule creates two new safe harbors i for price reductions by manufacturers to plan sponsors under medicare part d and medicaid managed care organizations that are reflected at the time of dispense and ii for fixedfee service arrangements between manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers hhsoig has temporarily postponed the effective date of the new safe harbors to march 22 2021 additionally hhs recently agreed to postpone the elimination of the aforementioned regulatory safe harbor to january 1 2023 

federal civil monetary penalties law the federal civil monetary penalty statute provides for civil monetary penalties against any person who gives something of value to a medicare or medicaid program beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider for medicare or medicaid items or services under this law our whollyowned home delivery pharmacies specialty pharmacies and home health providers are restricted from offering certain items of value to influence a medicare or medicaid patient’s use of services the aca also includes several civil monetary provisions such as penalties for the failure to report and return a known overpayment and failure to grant timely access to the hhsoig under certain circumstances 

federal and state oversight of governmentsponsored health care programs 

participation in governmentsponsored health care programs subjects us to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under these programs these audits may occur years after the provision of services risks include potential fines and penalties restrictions on our ability to participate or expand our presence in certain programs and restrictions on marketing our plans for example with respect to our medicare advantage business cms and the hhsoig perform audits to determine a health plan’s compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including program audits and risk adjustment data validation audits which focus on compliance with proper coding practices certain of our contracts are currently subject to radv audits by cms and the hhsoig cms has announced that its goal is to subject all medicare advantage contracts to either a comprehensive or a targeted radv audit for each contract year the doj is also currently conducting an industrywide investigation of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes including medical chart reviews and health exams of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

for our medicare part d business compliance with certain contractual provisions and regulatory requirements is subject to review by recovery audit contractor audits in which thirdparty contractors conduct postpayment reviews on a contingency fee basis to detect and correct improper payments 

government procurement regulations 

we have a contract with the us department of defense “dod” which subjects us to applicable federal acquisition regulations “far” and the dod far supplement which govern federal government contracts further there are other federal and state laws applicable to our dod arrangement and our arrangements with other clients that may be subject to government procurement regulations in addition certain of our clients participate as contracting carriers in the federal employees health benefits program administered by the opm which includes various pharmacy benefit management standards 

employee retirement income security act 

our domestic subsidiaries sell most of their products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by erisa erisa is a complex set of federal laws and regulations enforced by the irs and the dol as well as the courts erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationship between us the employers that maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to erisa and participants in such plans certain of our domestic subsidiaries are also subject to requirements imposed by erisa affecting claim payment and appeals procedures for individual health insurance and insured and selfinsured group health plans and for the insured dental disability life and accident plans we administer certain of our domestic subsidiaries also may contractually agree to comply with these requirements on behalf of the selfinsured dental disability life and accident plans they administer we believe the conduct of our pharmacy benefit management business is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of erisa however there can be no assurances that the dol may not assert that pharmacy benefit managers are fiduciaries from time to time states have considered legislation to declare a pharmacy benefit manager or health benefit manager a fiduciary with respect to its clients 

plans subject to erisa can also be subject to state laws and the legal question of whether and to what extent erisa preempts a state law will continue to be subject to court interpretation including by the us supreme court 

privacy security and data standards regulations 

many of our activities involve the receipt or use of confidential health and other personal information in addition we use aggregated and deidentified data for our own research and analysis purposes and in some cases provide access to such deidentified data or analytics created from such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators we may also use such information to create analytic models designed to predict and potentially improve outcomes and patient care there are also industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements for using and disclosing personal information 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations “hipaa” impose minimum standards on health insurers pharmacy benefit managers hmos health plans health care providers and clearinghouses for the privacy and security of protected health information hipaa regulations may also hold us liable for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers hipaa also established rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions including but not limited to eligibility and claims to the extent insurers offer plans through a public exchange participants and their downstream entities such as pharmacy benefit managers must adhere to privacy and security standards for personally identifiable information and to impose standards that are at least as protective as those the exchange has implemented for itself these standards may differ from and be more stringent than hipaa 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech” imposes additional contracting requirements for covered entities the extension of privacy and security provisions to business associates the requirement to provide notification to various parties in the event of a data breach of protected health information and enhanced financial penalties for hipaa violations including potential criminal penalties for individuals in the conduct of our business depending on the circumstances we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate 

the federal grammleachbliley act and its implementing regulations generally place restrictions on the disclosure of nonpublic information to nonaffiliated third parties and requires financial institutions including insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures state departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law 

state and local authorities are increasingly focused on protecting individuals from identity theft and a number of states have adopted comprehensive data security laws and regulations requiring among other things certain minimum data security standards and security breach notifications that may apply to us in certain circumstances as well as certain limitations on access to and use of personal information neither hipaa nor the grammleachbliley privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations which may differ in approach and enforcement the california consumer privacy act which went into effect in january 2020 provides additional privacy rights for california residents although it generally does not apply to certain regulated data such as information covered by hipaa in november 2020 california further expanded privacy rights for california residents by enacting the california privacy rights act which includes additional protections on sensitive personal information creates new individual rights for residents and imposes additional requirements for those entities collecting personal information of california residents and their service providers beginning in 2023 we anticipate federal and state regulators to continue to enact legislation related to privacy and cybersecurity 

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 “cisa” encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry states have also begun to issue regulations specifically related to cybersecurity which may differ or conflict from state to state in october 2017 the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” an organization of state insurance regulators adopted the insurance data security model law that creates rules for insurers and other covered entities addressing data security investigation and notification of breaches this includes maintaining an information security program based on ongoing risk assessment overseeing thirdparty service providers investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event as the model law is intended to serve as model legislation only states will need to enact legislation for the model law to become mandatory and enforceable we will continue to monitor states’ activity regarding cybersecurity regulation 

hhs including the onc the office for civil rights and cms has enacted regulations and proposed additional regulations to support the seamless and secure access exchange and use of electronic health information by or between patients enrollees and entities such as payers and health care providers these regulations include among others proposed changes to hipaa designed to 

promote greater patient access and control over health information maintained by health plans and health care providers and improve information sharing for case management and care coordination other interoperability regulations prohibit information blocking by certain entities and require certain regulated plans to make specified patient clinical and planrelated data available to enrollees via interoperable technology and applications these regulations apply to a variety of entities including health plans like medicare plans and qualified health plans as well as health care providers certified health information technology developers and health information networks and exchanges and generally require significant enhancements to information technology and data governance practices the regulations and proposals demonstrate an increased interest in information sharing and will impact how industry participants including us comply with disclosure requirements and share information with individuals and other healthcare organizations we continue to monitor developments and to submit comments on proposed regulations where appropriate 

in addition international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of personal information can be more stringent than in the united states and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective may 2018 enhanced or created obligations regarding the handling of personal data relating to european residents such as regarding notices data protection impact assessments and individual rights and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance than the previous european directive or laws in addition many countries outside of europe where we conduct business have implemented or may implement data protection laws and regulations some of which include requirements modeled after those in the gdpr some nonus jurisdictions are also instituting data residency regulations requiring that data be maintained within the respective jurisdiction or otherwise restricting transfer of personal data across borders unless specified regulatory requirements are met 

see part i item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with privacy and security regulations 

consumer protection laws 

we engage in directtoconsumer activities and are increasingly offering mobile and webbased solutions to our customers we are therefore subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and other consumer protection laws and regulations such as the telephone consumer protection act and the canspam act the ftc is also increasingly exercising its enforcement authority in the areas of consumer privacy and data security with a focus on webbased mobile data and “big data” federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information 

state and federal policymakers have taken actions intended to increase transparency and predictability of health care costs for consumers for example in october 2020 the hhs the dol and the department of the treasury issued a final rule that requires most group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose price and costsharing information for all items and services to participants and enrollees the costsharing information requirements under the rule take effect in a phased approach beginning january 1 2023 in addition to providing personalized costsharing information beginning january 1 2022 health plans and health insurers must also publicly disclose i innetwork provider negotiated rates ii historical outofnetwork allowed amounts and billed charges and iii innetwork negotiated rates and historical net prices for all covered prescription drugs beginning in 2021 insurers will be able to receive credit in their mlr calculations for certain savings they share with enrollees separately in december 2020 congress passed the no surprises act which prohibits health care providers in certain situations from balance billing the patient and requires that they work directly with insurers to agree on outofnetwork reimbursement including utilizing an independent dispute resolution process outlined in the act the act is effective january 1 2022 and we expect regulations implementing the act to be issued starting in 2021 many states already have addressed balance billing or surprise medical bills these laws and regulations vary in their approach resulting in different impacts on the health care system as a whole 

additionally most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs such statutes have also been cited as the basis for claims or investigations by state attorneys general relative to privacy and data security 

office of foreign assets control sanctions and antimoney laundering 

we are also subject to regulation by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes based on us foreign policy and national security goals certain of our products are subject to the department of the treasury antimoney laundering regulations under the bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to similar regulations in nonus jurisdictions in which we operate 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

many states in which our subsidiaries operate limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of 

physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed health care providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business 

laws and legislation affecting plan design and pharmacy network access 

some states have enacted laws that prohibit managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive benefit plan design features and many states have laws or have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to the pharmacy benefit for example some states under socalled “freedom of choice” legislation provide customers of the plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers some states have also enacted legislation that can negatively impact the use of costsaving network configurations for plan sponsors other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering customers financial incentives for use of home delivery pharmacies medicare and some states have issued guidance and regulations that limit our ability to fill or refill prescriptions electronically submitted by a physician to our home delivery pharmacy without first obtaining consent from the patient such restrictions generate additional costs and limit our ability to maximize efficiencies which could otherwise be gained through the electronic prescription and automatic refill processes legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention or to require coverage of all food and drug administration approved drugs other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and require health plan coverage of specific drugs if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician states are also standardizing the process for and restricting the use of utilization management rules and shortening the time frames within which prescription drug prior authorization determinations must be made even where states do not regulate pharmacy benefit or utilization management companies directly these laws will apply to many of our clients including managed care organizations and health insurers 

additionally medicare part d and a majority of states now have laws regulations or some form of legislation affecting our ability or our clients’ ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove a provider from a network such laws regulations or legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy or provider willing to meet the plan’s terms and conditions for network participation “any willing provider” or may direct that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures “due process” 

certain states have laws prohibiting certain pharmacy benefit management clients from imposing additional copayments deductibles limitations on benefits or other conditions on covered individuals utilizing a retail pharmacy when the same conditions are not otherwise imposed on covered individuals utilizing home delivery pharmacies however the laws require the retail pharmacy to agree to the same reimbursement amounts and terms and conditions as are imposed on the home delivery pharmacies an increase in the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies may have a negative impact on the number of prescriptions filled through home delivery 

pharmacy benefit management and drug pricing regulation 

our pharmacy benefit management services are subject to numerous laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern and proposed legislation and regulations may govern critical practices including disclosure receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers certain pharmacy contracting practices including disclosure of cost information to customers the receipt and retention of transmission fees from contracted pharmacies use of administration of or changes to drug formularies the use and disclosure of maximum allowable cost mac pricing or clinical programs “most favored nation” pricing which provides that a pharmacy participating in a specific government program must give the program the best price the pharmacy makes available to any thirdparty plan disclosure of data to third parties drug utilization management practices the level of duty a pharmacy benefit manager owes its clients or customers configuration of pharmacy networks the operations of our subsidiary pharmacies disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates disclosure of negotiated drug rebates calculation of certain customer costshare for prescription drug claims pricing that includes differential or spread ie a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsor by a pharmacy benefit manager and the price paid by the manager to the dispensing provider disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to customers’ drug utilization and registration or licensing of pharmacy benefit managers 

we expect federal and state governments to continue to prioritize means of addressing outofpocket costs for consumers particularly related to prescription drug costs policy proposals issued via regulation or legislation vary broadly in their approaches to achieve that 

goal at the federal level several executive orders were issued in 2020 although the orders did not contain any policy changes that take effect immediately they directed agencies to pursue regulations intended to expand access to affordable prescription drug medication through various methods resulting regulations from hhs and its agencies outlined paths for certain prescription drugs to be imported from canada under the federal food drug and cosmetic act effective november 30 2020 amended the antikickback safe harbors to eliminate the regulatory safe harbor protection for price concessions including rebates that are offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors or pharmacy benefit managers under the medicare part d program effective january 2023 and created new safe harbors related to pointofsale price reductions and fixedfee service arrangements as described above under the heading “antikickback and referral laws” issued rules intended to implement a program to make insulin and epinephrine available at participating federally qualified health centers at pricing under the public health service act section 340b program effective march 22 2021 and established a demonstration of the most favored nation international pricing model an approach to international reference pricing for medicare part b drugs which was subsequently halted by court intervention as noted earlier the executive order issued in january 2021 regarding a regulatory freeze pending review may delay or ultimately result in revision or repeal of various actions taken in response to the 2020 executive orders 

additionally proposals at the federal and state levels consider increased regulation of pharmacy benefit managers and health plans as a means to limit consumer out of pocket costs including proposing to limit the use of various pharmacy benefit management tools mandating the treatment of fees discounts or financing mechanisms that otherwise are set in private contractual terms increasing supply chain transparency expanding regulatory requirements or definitions of fiduciaries or mandating plan benefit designs that cap consumer outofpocket expense 

some states have enacted statutes regulating the use of mac pricing these statutes referred to as “mac transparency laws” generally require pharmacy benefit managers to disclose specific information related to mac pricing to pharmacies and provide certain appeal rights for pharmacies mac transparency laws also restrict the application of mac and may require operational changes to maintain compliance with the law some states have also enacted laws regulating pharmacy pricing and protecting the profitability of pharmacies for dispensing certain macpriced drugs some states have enacted laws requiring that the customer costshare for a prescription drug claim not exceed certain price points such as the pharmacy’s usual and customary charge or its contracted reimbursement for the drug in a recent supreme court decision the court found that certain mac transparency laws may be applied by states to erisa plans in addition to health plans regulated by the applicable state we continue to assess the impact of the decision on other state laws seeking to regulate pharmacy benefit management services 

in march 2018 the naic adopted changes to the health carrier prescription drug benefit management model act the changes address issues relating to i transparency accuracy and disclosure regarding prescription drug formularies and formulary changes during a policy year ii accessibility of prescription drug benefits using a variety of pharmacy options and iii tiered prescription drug formularies and discriminatory benefit design while the actions of the naic do not have the force of law they are used as a template to influence states to adopt laws based on the model legislation an enhanced naic model act on pharmacy benefit manager licensure and regulation was adopted by a subgroup of the naic subject to a thirty day comment period with further consideration expected to occur in 2021 

the federal medicaid drug rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs reimbursed through state medicaid programs including through medicaid managed care organizations manufacturers of brandname products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a 231 of the average manufacturer price “amp” paid by retail community pharmacies or by wholesalers for certain drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies or b the difference between amp and the “best price” available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program and certain other government programs with certain exceptions we negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and in certain circumstances sell services to drug manufacturers investigations are being and have been conducted by certain government entities which call into question whether a drug’s “best price” was properly calculated and reported with respect to rebates paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for such calculations reports or payments 

pharmacy regulation 

our home delivery and specialty pharmacies also subject us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy we are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the states in which our pharmacies are located most of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require outofstate home delivery pharmacies to register with or be licensed by the board of pharmacy or a similar regulatory body in the state these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state where the pharmacy is located although some states require compliance with certain laws in that state as it impacts or relates to drugs distributed or dispensed into that state 

our various pharmacy facilities also provide services under certain medicare and state medicaid programs participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs in addition several of our pharmacy facilities are participating providers under medicare part d and are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to medicare part d additionally we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our medicare plans and pricing between our plans and related parties including our pharmacy business 

other statutes and regulations affect our home delivery and specialty pharmacy operations including the federal and state antikickback laws and the federal civil monetary penalty law described above federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising adulteration and security of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances and certain of our pharmacies must register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities the ftc requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the product to be sold to fill mail orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate the united states postal service also has significant statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail 

financial reporting internal control and corporate governance 

regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and hmos states regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements the type and concentration of permitted investments and corporate governance over financial reporting our insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports and schedules with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which they do business as well as annual financial statements audited by independent registered public accounting firms certain insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file an annual report of internal control over financial reporting with most jurisdictions in which they do business insurance and hmo subsidiaries’ operations and financial statements are subject to examination by such agencies many states have expanded regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of insurance and hmo subsidiaries as a result of model regulations adopted by the naic with elements similar to corporate governance and risk oversight disclosure requirements under federal securities laws 

guaranty associations indemnity funds risk pools and administrative funds 

most states and certain nonus jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds that are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies some states have similar laws relating to hmos and other payors such as consumer operated and oriented plans coops established under the aca in the united states these associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims certain states require hmos to participate in guaranty funds special risk pools and administrative funds for additional information about guaranty funds and other assessments see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

certain states continue to require health insurers and hmos to participate in assigned risk plans joint underwriting authorities pools or other residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards although some states have eliminated these requirements as a result of the aca 

solvency and capital requirements 

many states have adopted some form of the naic model solvencyrelated laws and riskbased capital “rbc” rules for life and health insurance companies and hmos the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred if the ratio of the insurer’s adjusted surplus to its rbc falls below statutorily required minimums the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 

in addition various nonus jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency liquidity and reserve coverage measures our hmos and life and health insurance subsidiaries as well as nonus insurance subsidiaries are compliant with applicable rbc and nonus surplus rules 

the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act “orsa” adopted by the naic provides requirements and principles for maintaining a group solvency assessment and a risk management framework and reflects a broader approach to us insurance regulation orsa includes a requirement to file an annual orsa summary report in the lead state of domicile to date an overwhelming majority of the states have adopted the same or similar versions of orsa we file our orsa report annually as required 

holding company laws 

our domestic insurance companies and certain of our hmos are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies under such laws certain dividends distributions and other transactions between an insurance company or an hmo subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to or approval by one or more state insurance commissioners in addition the holding company acts of states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo subsidiary without prior regulatory approval state holding company laws and regulations also subject our insurance companies and certain hmo subsidiaries to additional regulatory scrutiny related to their oversight of affiliates performing regulated services on behalf of the insurance company or hmo and require the company to file an annual enterprise risk report which summarizes material risks that could pose enterprise risk to the insurance company subsidiaries 

marketing advertising and products 

in most states our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are required to certify compliance with applicable advertising regulations on an annual basis our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are also required by most states to file and secure regulatory approval of products prior to the marketing advertising and sale of such products 

licensing and registration requirements 

our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business additionally certain subsidiaries contract to provide claim administration utilization management and other related services for the administration of selfinsured benefit plans these subsidiaries may be subject to state thirdparty administration and other licensing requirements and regulation as well as thirdparty accreditation requirements 

we have received full accreditation for utilization review accreditation commission pharmacy benefit management version 22 standards which includes quality standards for drug utilization management and select subsidiaries have received full accreditation for utilization review accreditation commission for health utilization management version 72 which includes quality standards for medical utilization management 

certain states have adopted pharmacy benefit management registration licensure or disclosure laws in addition to registration laws some states have adopted legislation mandating disclosure of various aspects of our financial practices including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms 

our international subsidiaries are often required to be licensed when entering new markets or starting new operations in certain jurisdictions the licensure requirements for these subsidiaries vary by country and are subject to change 

international regulations 

our operations outside the united states expose us to laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies and regulators including those related to the provision of insurance financial and other disclosures the provision of health carerelated services corporate governance privacy data protection data mining data transfer intellectual property labor and employment consumer protection directtoconsumer communications activities tax anticorruption and antimoney laundering foreign laws and rules may include requirements that are different from or more stringent than similar requirements in the united states 

our operations in countries outside the united states 

• are subject to local regulations of the jurisdictions where we operate 

• in some cases are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions where customers reside and 

• in all cases are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” 

in particular in south korea regulators are focused on protecting the rights of individual customers by enforcing “treating customers fairly” concepts this regulatory focus has resulted in rigorous data localization requirements network separation obligations and system monitoring restrictions as well as obligations to closely monitor marketing communications and sales scripts antimoney laundering requirements in south korea and other countries where we do business also may impose obligations to collect certain information about each customer at time of sale or to risk rank each customer to determine possible future money laundering risk 

the fcpa prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official or employee to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage outside of the united states we may interact with 

government officials in several different capacities as regulators of our insurance business as clients or partners who are stateowned or partially stateowned as health care providers who are employed by the government as hospitals that are stateowned and as officials issuing permits in connection with real estate transactions violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and doj have increased their enforcement activities with respect to fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 applies to all companies with a nexus to the united kingdom under this act any voluntary disclosures of fcpa violations may be shared with united kingdom authorities thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions other countries in which we do business also have anticorruption laws to which we are subject 




 item 1a risk factors 

as a large global health service company operating in a complex industry we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity results of operations financial condition or the trading price of our securities you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below together with other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance 

strategic and operational risks 

future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively 

the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors including our ability to 

• differentiate our products services and solutions from those of our competitors 

• develop introduce and partner to bring forward new and innovative products solutions or programs that focus on improving patient outcomes and assist in controlling costs or are in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumerdirected products 

• develop and create data and analytic solutions to support and improve outcomes for our products services and solutions including creating and developing solutions and services through partnerships with other industry participants 

• grow our product portfolio expand our addressable markets and identify and introduce the proper mix coordination or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace 

• evaluate drugs for efficacy value and price to assist clients in selecting a costeffective formulary 

• offer costeffective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services 

• access or continue accessing key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories in our specialty pharmacy business 

• leverage purchase volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers 

• attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees 

• attract develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners 

• attract new and maintain existing customer and client relationships 

• transition health care providers from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased system 

• improve medical cost competitiveness in our targeted markets 

• manage our medical pharmacy administrative and other operating costs effectively and 

• contract with health care providers pharmacy providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers on favorable terms 

for our strategic initiatives to succeed we must effectively collaborate across our operations integrate our acquired businesses actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization and promote a global mindset along with a focus on individual customers and clients if we fail to do so our business may be unable to grow as planned or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory we will be unable to rapidly respond to competitive economic and regulatory changes if we do not make important strategic and operational decisions quickly define our appetite for risk implement new governance managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly if these initiatives fail or are not executed effectively our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected 

we operate in a highly competitive evolving and rapidly changing industry and our failure to adapt could negatively impact our business 

the health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving any significant shifts in the structure of the industry could alter industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients and customers industry shifts could result and have resulted from among other things 

• a large intra or interindustry merger or industry consolidation 

• strategic alliances 

• new or alternative business models or new government options or offerings 

• continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other health care providers as well as changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and health care providers 

• new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health service industry 

• the ability of larger employers and clients to contract directly with providers 

• technological changes and rapid shifts in the use of technology such as telehealth 

• the impact or consequences of legislation or regulatory changes 

• changes in the united states postal service or the consolidation of shipping carriers 

• increased drug acquisition cost or unexpected changes to drug pricing trend 

• changes in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market or 

• changes in utilization of health care prescription drugs or other covered services and items including under riskbased contracts in the health benefit management market and for those businesses that utilize risk adjustment methodology 

our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the scale scope and duration of the covid19 pandemic continues to be unknown and the overall impact on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition has been and may continue to be material 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies financial markets and the overall environment for our business and the extent to which it may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has in some instances and may continue to heighten the potential adverse effects on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition as described below or in other risk factors within this section of the form 10k including but not limited to the likelihood of and impact from 

• unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers both employers and individuals health care providers pharmaceutical manufacturers pharmacy providers and thirdparty vendors as well as federal and state entities and programs 

• changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures changes in customer base and product mix changes in utilization of prescription drugs medical or other covered items or services including increased behavioral health services utilization changes in medical cost trends changes in our health management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products causing actual claims to exceed our estimates 

• changes in health care utilization patterns provider billing practices and other external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control impacting our ability to accurately predict price for and manage health care costs and ultimately our profitability including impacts from care deferral on among other things risk adjustment revenue and acuity of future care 

• increased costs or reductions in revenue including costs for covid19related care testing and treatment and related costshare waivers for our customers vaccine and other coverage mandates and support for employees clients customers and providers 

• significant disruptions in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties including decreased worker productivity and operational and sales disruptions including as a result of remote working arrangements increased medical emergency or other leave quarantines government actions or restrictions 

• compliance with substantial government regulation including privacy and security requirements associated with providing telehealth and remote care options for individuals and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations such as vaccine and coverage mandates and premium deferrals which laws or regulations may vary significantly by jurisdiction 

• prioritization of matters relating to covid19 resulting in delays in responsiveness by regulatory agencies and other third parties in matters arising in the ordinary course of business 

• cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents including as a result of the transition to a remote work environment by substantially all of our workforce and the workforces of third parties with whom we contract 

• significant shifts in the structure of the industry which could alter dynamics and if we fail to adapt negatively impact our business 

• risks inherent in foreign operations including political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks 

• economic and market conditions affecting the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities and 

• fluctuations in equity market prices interest rates and credit spreads limiting our ability to raise or deploy capital and affecting our overall liquidity 

additionally if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if our clients or customers do not perceive our response to be adequate we could suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

we believe covid19’s adverse impact on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition will be driven primarily by the severity and duration of the pandemic including the impact of the breadth and timing of implementation and the efficacy and costs of vaccination programs the pandemic’s impact on our employees clients customers suppliers and partners as well as the us 

and global economies and the continued actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic those primary drivers are largely beyond our knowledge and control and may be more adverse than our current expectations given these uncertainties we cannot estimate the full impact covid19 will have on our business operating results cash flows or financial condition but the adverse impact could be material 

our failure to compete effectively to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and maintain or increase market share could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer and client needs legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors in particular markets our competitors may have greater better or more established capabilities resources market share reputation or business relationships or lower profit margin or financial return expectations our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between our competitors and us our express scripts client contracts generally have threeyear terms and may be subject to periodic renegotiation of pricing terms based on market factors as described in greater detail in the description of our business in item 1 of this form 10k one of our key clients in the evernorth segment is the united states department of defense if one or more of our large clients terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason including as a result of being acquired or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in decreases in the trading price of our securities or other adverse effects 

our success depends in part on our ability to compete effectively in our markets set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share increase customers as planned differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that provide enhanced value to our customers provide quality and satisfactory levels of service and retain accounts with favorable medical cost experience or more profitable products versus retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience or less profitable products 

we must remain competitive to attract new customers retain existing customers and further integrate additional product and service offerings to succeed in this highly competitive marketplace it is imperative that we maintain a strong reputation the negative reputational impact of a significant event including a failure to execute on customer or client contracts or strategic or operational initiatives failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our customers could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable arrangements which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we face price competition and other pressures that could compress our margins or result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of services delivered to our customers 

while we compete on the basis of many service and qualityrelated factors we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition our client contracts are subject to negotiation as clients seek to contain their costs including by reducing benefits offered increasingly our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met clients can easily move between our competitors and us our clients are well informed and typically have knowledgeable consultants that seek competing bids from our competitors before contract renewal in addition as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams they look to take on services that we typically provide each of these events could negatively impact our financial results 

federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict or prevent entirely our ability to implement changes in premium rates fiscal or other concerns related to the governmentsponsored programs in which we participate such as medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans may cause decreasing reimbursement rates delays in premium payments restrictions on implementing changes in premium rates or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of customers or clients resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

premiums in the us medical segment are generally set for oneyear periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences or renews our revenue on medicare advantage plans individual and family plans “ifp” and medicare part d plans is based on rates and bids submitted midyear in the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare advantage ifp and medicare part d rates and bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period actual costs may exceed what we estimate in setting premiums our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control including changes in regulations as well as provider billing practices and changes in customers’ health care utilization patterns which may among other things impact our ability to appropriately document their health conditions our participation in health insurance exchanges through our ifp offerings involves 

uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows our profitability depends in part on our ability to accurately predict price for and effectively manage future health care costs relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results 

strong competition within the pharmacy benefit business has also generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings these competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many companies including us to reduce the prices charged for products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the formulary fees and related rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers our inability to maintain positive trends or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited 

we maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including historical claim experience but this estimation process requires extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures changes in customer base and product mix changes in the utilization of prescription drugs medical or other covered items or services changes in medical cost trends changes in our health management practices changes in regulations and the introduction of new benefits and products if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited additionally we must estimate the amount of rebates payable by us under the aca’s and cms’ minimum loss ratio rules and the amounts payable by us to and receivable by us from the united states federal government under the aca’s remaining premium stabilization program because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing reserves which may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health service providers and with producers and consultants our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we contract with or employ physicians hospitals and other health service providers and facilities to provide health services to our customers our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices in any particular market physicians hospitals and health service providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products or services for our customers in some markets certain providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations and multispecialty physician groups may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us if providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially adversely affected additionally certain regulations may impact our ability to obtain competitive prices establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups specialist groups independent practice associations hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased health care system if such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected 

our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers may also be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us such as changes in medicare or medicaid reimbursement levels increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals physician groups and providers continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other providers the emergence of accountable care organizations vertical integration of providers and other entities changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and providers and new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health care industry may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate in some instances these organizations may compete directly with us potentially affecting the way we price our products and services or causing us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive 

outofnetwork providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill while benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement and regulations seek to prescribe payment levels establish methodologies and dispute resolution processes outofnetwork providers are increasingly sophisticated and aggressive as a result the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

additionally certain of our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we compete our sales could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

if we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with among other things 

• discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies 

• discounts in the form of rebates for drug utilization 

• fees for administering rebate programs including invoicing allocating and collecting rebates 

• fees for services provided to pharmaceutical manufacturers by our specialty pharmacies and 

• access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals by our specialty pharmacies 

our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers are typically nonexclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party the consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums adoption of new laws rules or regulations or changes in or new interpretations of existing laws rules or regulations relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

more than 67700 pharmacies participated in one or more of our networks as of december 31 2020 the ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 64 of the total number of stores in our largest network in certain geographic areas of the united states our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains contracts with retail pharmacies are generally nonexclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party if one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us or is able to renegotiate terms substantially less favorable to us our customers’ access to retail pharmacies or our business could be materially adversely affected the entry of one or more additional large pharmacy chains into the pharmacy benefit management business the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could have a negative impact on our claims volume or our competitiveness in the marketplace which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations 

changes in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy clients generally use pricing metrics published by third parties as benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs if these benchmarks are no longer published by third parties we or our contractual partners adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry legislation or regulation requires the use of other pricing benchmarks or future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations the short or longterm impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a global company we face political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations or our longterm growth 

as a global company our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks can vary substantially by market and include political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks including government intervention that we 

do not face in our us operations the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

• geopolitical business conditions and demands including the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union 

• regulation that may discriminate against us companies favor nationalization or expropriate assets 

• price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds out of the countries in which we operate foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations and restrictions on converting currencies from foreign operations into other currencies uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of tax positions 

• reliance on local employees and interpretations of labor laws in foreign jurisdictions 

• managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the united states 

• providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations 

• the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements 

• acts of civil unrest war and terrorism as well as other political and economic conflicts such as through imposition of economic or political sanctions 

• manmade disasters natural disasters and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic in locations where we operate and 

• general economic and political conditions 

these factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally and operating in new foreign markets may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or long term growth for example due to the concentration of our international business in south korea the international markets segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that country and the geopolitical climate in the korean peninsula as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean currency that could have a significant impact on the segment’s results and our consolidated financial results 

international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with us and foreign laws prohibiting bribery corruption and money laundering in addition to other regulations regarding among other things our products directtoconsumer communications customer privacy data protection and data residency violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and longterm growth 

strategic transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges 

as part of our strategy we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures licensing arrangements divestitures and other relationships collectively referred to as “strategic transactions” there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities and we may be unable to identify and successfully complete strategic transactions in the future in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives and we may divest or wind down such businesses we may be unable to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us within the expected timeframes or at all we may have continued financial exposure to divested businesses following the completion of any such transaction including increased costs due to potential litigation contingent liabilities and indemnification of the buyer related to among other things lawsuits regulatory matters or tax liabilities 

our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to successfully combine or separate business operations resources and systems including data security systems and internal financial control standards in an efficient and effective manner integration and separation activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected these activities are complex costly and timeconsuming and may divert management’s attention from ongoing business concerns delays or issues encountered in these activities could have a material adverse effect on the revenues expenses operating results and financial condition of the company 

strategic transactions could result in increased costs including facilities and systems consolidation or separation costs and costs to retain key employees decreases in expected revenues earnings or cash flows and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges as of december 31 2020 our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of approximately 80 billion representing 51 of our total consolidated assets the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if the businesses we acquire do not perform in a manner consistent with our assumptions future evaluations requiring an impairment to 

goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants in addition the trading price of our securities may decline if among other things we are unable to achieve our estimates of earnings growth and operational cost savings or the transaction costs related to acquisitions integrations or divestitures are greater than expected the trading price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of a transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts 

additionally joint ventures and equity investments present risks that are different from acquisitions including risks related to specific operations and finances of the businesses we invest in selection of appropriate parties differing objectives of the various parties competition between and among parties compliance activities including compliance with applicable cms requirements growing the business in a manner acceptable to all the parties maintaining positive relationships among the parties clients and customers initial and ongoing governance of joint ventures and customer and business disruption that may occur upon a joint venture termination 

further we may finance strategic transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders or by incurring additional debt that could increase costs and impact our ability to access capital in the future 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud the integration of businesses is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations we also rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of joint venture entities and other entities in which we invest and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could negatively impact the trading price of our securities and our access to capital 

we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions 

to improve operating costs productivity and efficiencies we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services our operations may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations to us if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a contractual dispute between us and the third party even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections we have limited control over the actions of third parties for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations any security breach involving one of our thirdparty vendors or a dispute between us and a thirdparty vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations adopt new processes for managing these service providers or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our thirdparty vendors do not perform as expected we may not realize or not realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships this could result in additional costs or regulatory compliance issues or create other operational or financial problems for us terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach termination or transition in services we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and in turn our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

a significant disruption in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as claims processing and payment internet support and customer call centers data centers and corporate facilities processing new and renewal business maintaining appropriate shipment and storage conditions for prescriptions such as temperature and protection from contamination and home delivery processing in some instances our ability to provide services or products including processing and dispensing prescriptions depends on the availability of services and products provided by suppliers providers pharmaceutical manufacturers vendors or shipping carriers a disruption or threat of disruption in our supply chain including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business additionally any failure or disruption of our performance of or our ability to perform key business functions including through unavailability or cyberattack of our information technology systems or those of third parties could cause slower response times decreased levels of service satisfaction and harm to our reputation our information 

technology and other systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems and we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations 

our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care providers and to operate our business if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error or if we or any of the thirdparty service providers we engage were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients customers and health care providers and hinder our ability to provide services and products establish appropriate pricing for products and services retain and attract clients and customers establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance among other things 

our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success we must continue to invest in longterm solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations enhance the customer experience act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats our success is dependent in large part on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a costefficient and resourceefficient manner increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important we must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner further because system development projects are longterm in nature they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion our failure to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

as a large health service company we are subject to cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks we may suffer exposure to substantial liability reputational harm loss of revenue or other damages 

our business depends on our clients’ and customers’ willingness to entrust us with their healthrelated and other sensitive personal information computer systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses or malware programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems we have been and will likely continue to be the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access cyberattacks or other computerrelated penetrations there have been and will likely continue to be large scale cyberattacks within the health service industry additionally hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information technology human or technological error has and could in the future result in for example unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of company customer or other thirdparty data or systems theft of sensitive regulated or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware destructive attacks or other means and business delays service or system disruptions or denials of service 

as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally our exposure to unintended disclosures data security and related cybersecurity risks increases including the risk of undetected attacks damage loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases if disruptions disclosures or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded we have implemented security technologies processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks however there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches 

cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our proprietary systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties such as external service providers and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers in addition while we have certain standards for all vendors 

that provide us services our vendors and in turn their own service providers may become subject to the same types of security breaches finally our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft misplaced or lost data human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers’ and clients’ data 

the costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers 

in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers or other third parties could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy could also negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives such events could cause us to breach our contractual obligations and violate applicable laws these events would negatively affect our ability to compete others’ trust in us our reputation customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure requirements litigation and other enforcement proceedings material fines penalties or remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders and other adverse actions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

in managing medical practices and operating pharmacies onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense 

in addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services we employ physicians pharmacists nurses and other health care providers at our home delivery and specialty pharmacies onsite low acuity and primary care practices and infusion clinics that we manage and operate for our customers as well as certain clinics for our employees we also provide inhome care through health care providers that we employ as well as through thirdparty contractors as such we may be subject to liability for certain acts omissions or injuries caused by our employees or agents or occurring at one of these practices pharmacies or clinics the defense of any actions may require the diversion of personnel and other resources and the incurrence of significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

legal and compliance risks 

our business is subject to substantial government regulation as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and related interpretations are increasing in number and complexity are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or our thirdparty vendors could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

we must identify assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business there are currently pending and in the future there will likely be legislative or regulatory proposals which seek to manage the health services industry including managing prescription drug costs and health records as well as regulating drug distribution we expect federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system in addition changes to government policies not specifically targeted to the health services industry such as a change in tax laws and the corporate tax rate or government spending cuts could have significant impacts on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity the trading price of our securities may react to the announcement of such proposals we are unable to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted or the specific terms thereof including their effect on our operations however certain of these proposals could if enacted adversely impact our business and results of operations 

existing or future laws rules regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business affect the products and services we offer and where we offer them restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our costs including medical operating health care technology and administrative costs and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment for example a decision invalidating the aca or portions thereof could result in material changes to the way we conduct our business as well as the loss of subsidies related to our ifp offerings we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to among other things market many of our products expand into additional geographic or product markets increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs existing or future laws and rules could also require or lead us to take other actions such as changing our business practices and could increase our liability 

further failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives such as by reducing operating costs adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

for more information on regulations affecting our business see “business – regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

there are various risks associated with participating in governmentsponsored programs such as medicare including dependence upon government funding compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight and enforcement 

through our us government business we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans additionally our evernorth business provides services to government entities and payers participating in government health care programs 

our revenues from government funded programs including our medicare programs and our government clients are dependent in whole or in part upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state or local governments funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available unanticipated changes in funding such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments or the failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability 

the medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans are established by contract although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors some of which are outside our control for example the base premium rate paid differs depending upon a combination of various factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region benefit mix member eligibility category and risk scores additionally a portion of each medicare advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s star rating with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for qualitybased bonus payments a plan’s star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform well are able to offer enhanced benefits market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater our medicare advantage plans’ and medicare part d plans’ operating results premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership or impact our financial performance see part ii item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of information – industry developments and other matters affecting our evernorth and us medical segments for additional information on our star ratings 

additionally if we fail to comply with cms’ contractual requirements including data submission enrollment and marketing provider network adequacy provider directory accuracy quality measures claims payment continuity of care timely and accurate processing of appeals and grievances oversight of first tier downstream and related entities and call center performance we may be subject to administrative actions including enrollment sanctions or contract termination fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability as described under “business – regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule that would revise its radv methodology and if adopted in its current form could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits higher monthly premiums or reduced choice for the population served by all medicare advantage insurers while it is uncertain whether cms will finalize the rule as proposed if adopted it could have a material impact on the company’s future results of operations 

any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs could result in investigations or litigation such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws this could subject us to damage awards including treble damages fines penalties or other enforcement actions restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers limits on expansion restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies which could adversely impact our business cash flows financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we face risks related to litigation regulatory audits and investigations 

we are routinely involved in numerous claims lawsuits regulatory audits investigations and other legal matters arising for the most part in the ordinary course of business these legal matters could include benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims claims arising from consumer protection laws false claims act laws claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements employment and employment discriminationrelated suits antitrust claims employee benefit claims wage and hour claims tax privacy intellectual property and whistleblower claims shareholder suits and other securities law claims real estate disputes claims related to disclosure of certain business practices and claims arising from customer audits and contract performance including government contracts in addition we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business such as marketing misconduct failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care provider network structure poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions erisa claims allegations related to calculations of cost sharing and claims related to our administration of selffunded business we are also routinely involved in legal matters arising from our health services business including without limitation claims related to the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our home delivery and specialty pharmacies pharmacy benefit management services such as formulary management services health benefit management services and provider services there are currently and may be in the future attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and other companies in our industry individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry 

court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages may be sought we procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities however we also selfinsure a significant portion of our litigation risks while we maintain some thirdparty insurance coverage including excess liability insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers certain liabilities or types of damages such as punitive damages may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded resolving disputes is often expensive and disruptive regardless of the outcome additionally it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices losses material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation 

we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare and pharmacy departments attorneys general doj cms dol and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions additionally we are and may in the future be subject to qui tam actions in which the government may or may not intervene with respect to our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plans compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments certain of our contracts are currently subject to radv audits by cms and the oig the doj is conducting an industrywide investigation of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes including review of medical charts and health exams of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health services industry including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices and increased scrutiny by other federal and state governmental agencies such as state attorneys general empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings 

in addition various government agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pharmacy benefit management practices many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other companies being subject to civil penalties including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements we cannot predict what effect if any such government investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the industry in general however we will likely continue to experience government scrutiny and audit activity which has and may in the future result in civil penalties 

regulatory audits investigations or reviews or actions by other government agencies could result in changes to our business practices retroactive adjustments to certain premiums significant fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including corporate integrity agreements restrictions on our ability to participate in government programs market certain products or engage in businessrelated activities that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity in addition disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

a description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k the outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected 

most of our activities involve the receipt use storage or transmission of a substantial amount of individuals’ protected health information and personally identifiable information we also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes and in some cases provide access to such deidentified data or analytics created from such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators and analysts we may also use such information to create analytic models designed to predict and potentially improve outcomes and patient care the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients in some cases such laws rules regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements we are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information such as the gdpr can be more stringent than in the united states and they vary across jurisdictions in addition more jurisdictions are regulating the transfer of data across borders and domestic privacy and data protection laws are generally becoming more onerous 

these laws rules and contractual requirements are subject to change and the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding compliance with existing or new privacy security and data laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for more information on privacy regulations to which we are subject see “business – regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

hipaa requires covered entities to comply with the hipaa privacy security and breach rules in addition business associates must comply with the hipaa security and breach requirements while we endeavor to provide appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs administers an audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates in addition hhs continues to exercise its enforcement authority such as enforcement actions resulting from investigations brought on by notification to hhs of a breach an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows and reputation 

noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could materially adversely affect our business and reputation including our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

effective prevention detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change in addition ongoing vigorous law enforcement a highly technical regulatory scheme and the doddfrank act and related regulations enhance regulators’ enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources failure of our prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings fines and penalties 

in addition provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our selfinsured clients further during an economic downturn we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation 

economic risks 

economic and market conditions affect the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities investment income and interest expense 

as an insurer we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities and surplus requirements in our regulated companies the market values of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions with no offsetting change in the value of a majority of our liabilities a substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interestyielding debt securities of varying maturities and commercial mortgage loans the value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio increase interest expense on our indebtedness and increase investment income as investment assets mature and are replaced in addition an economic contraction could result in delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers reducing our investment income and requiring us to write down the value of our investments 

significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses 

we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans a significant decline in the value of the plans’ equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding this could reduce the cash available to us including our subsidiaries we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension obligations sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plans 

a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital 

financial strength claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future a downgrade of any of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth 

we maintain significant indebtedness in the ordinary course of business and may incur further indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt service costs leaving us with less cash flow from operations available to fund growth stock repurchases dividends and other corporate purposes 

the total indebtedness of cigna was approximately 329 billion as of december 31 2020 carrying indebtedness 

• requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund our operations and growth strategy including investments acquisitions and capital expenditures make stock repurchases pay dividends and for general corporate purposes 

• increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions which may require us to dedicate an even greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt and limit our access to capital markets such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms 

• exposes us to increases in interest rates to the extent increased interest expense is not offset by increased income from our investment assets and 

• limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry 

the covenants in our debt instruments may have the effect among other things of restricting our financial and operating flexibility to respond to significant changes in business and economic conditions we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future which may subject us to additional restrictive covenants and increase the risks described above if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to seek additional dividends from our subsidiaries sell assets seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt 

unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

many factors including geopolitical issues future economic downturns natural disasters and pandemics availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the us and global economies our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers both employers and individuals health care providers pharmacy manufacturers pharmacy providers and thirdparty vendors for example 

• employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us 

• higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employerbased plans including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employerbased plans or our individual plans 

• because of unfavorable economic conditions or the aca employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 

• if clients are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us 

• our clients or potential clients may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 

• our clients may be acquired consolidated or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business or workforce which could reduce the number of customers we serve or otherwise result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services 

• a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers potentially increasing our medical costs 

• our thirdparty vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion 

• other insurers financial condition may be weakened increasing the risk that we will receive significant assessments for obligations of insolvent insurers pursuant to guaranty associations indemnity funds or other similar laws and regulations 

these factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base revenues or margins or an increase in our operating costs 

in addition during and following a prolonged unfavorable economic environment federal and state budgets could be materially adversely affected resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in federal and state government programs such as medicare and social security or under contracts with government entities these federal and state budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers 

we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies primarily in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold 

under all reinsurance arrangements reinsurers assume insured losses subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit these arrangements also subject us to various obligations representations and warranties with the reinsurers reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies reinsurers may become financially unsound if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies 

the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition as of december 31 2020 compared with december 31 2019 and our results of operations for 2020 compared with 2019 and 2018 and is intended to help you understand the ongoing trends in our business we encourage you to read this mda in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k form 10k and the “risk factors” contained in part i item 1a of this form 10k for comparisons of our results of operations for 2019 compared with 2018 please refer to the previously filed mda included in part ii item 7 of our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

unless otherwise indicated financial information in this mda is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information regarding the company’s significant accounting policies in some of our financial tables in this mda we present either percentage changes or “nm” when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful changes in percentages are expressed in basis points “bps” 

in this mda our consolidated measures “adjusted income from operations” earnings per share on that same basis and “adjusted revenues” are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable gaap measures of “shareholders’ net income” “earnings per share” and “total revenues” we also use pretax adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues to measure the results of our segments 

we use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue expenses and profitability we define adjusted income from operations as shareholders’ net income or income before taxes for the segment metric excluding realized investment gains and losses amortization of acquired intangible assets special items and prior to 2020 results of anthem inc and coventry health care inc “coventry” collectively the “transitioning clients” see the “key transactions and business developments” section of this mda for further discussion of transitioning clients cigna’s share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded income or expense amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of underlying performance or the responsibility of operating segment management include 

• realized investment gains losses including changes in market values of certain financial instruments between balance sheet dates as well as gains and losses associated with invested asset sales 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets because these relate to costs incurred for acquisitions 

• results of transitioning clients prior to 2020 because those results are not indicative of ongoing results  

• special items if any that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to the nature or size of these matters 

the term adjusted revenues is defined as total revenues excluding the following adjustments revenue contribution from transitioning clients prior to 2020 special items and cigna’s share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting we exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business 

executive overview 

cigna corporation together with its subsidiaries either individually or collectively referred to as “cigna” the “company” “we” “our” or “us” is a global health services organization with a mission of helping those we serve improve their health wellbeing and peace of mind we offer a differentiated set of pharmacy medical dental and related products and services offered by our subsidiaries for further information on our business and strategy see item 1 business in this form 10k 

covid19 update 

the novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” was declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 from the onset of the covid19 pandemic we have taken actions to drive affordability reduce uncertainty and make health care easier for customers these actions include covid19 related cost share waivers expanded access to virtual care support for access to medication and advocating for whole person health through various behavioral health initiatives we have supported the medical community by simplifying processes and donating medications for a covid19 clinical trial cigna and the cigna foundation have assisted our communities through several initiatives including the launch of the brave of heart fund that provides financial assistance to survivors of frontline us health care workers who gave their lives in the fight against covid19 cigna also provides emotional support services to their families the evernorth team launched parachuterx a drug cost assistance program to certain customers without health coverage due to furlough or job loss cigna medical group was among the first in the united states to administer antibody therapies to highrisk covid19 patients in a nonhospital setting cigna also partnered with other organizations on digital access to vaccination records for those who have received the covid19 vaccine to facilitate return to work and daily activities 

we have continued to support our workforce by enabling remote work where appropriate and implemented enhanced safety protocols and programs that support the health and mental wellbeing of our employees we have continued to execute our business continuity plans over our operations such as leveraging purchasing volume across the pharmaceutical supply chain in order to mitigate risk associated with prescription drug supply we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during 2020 from covid19 

we will continue to work with our clients customers providers and employees to provide support during the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has pervasively impacted the economy financial markets and the global health care delivery systems the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the company began to emerge in the united states at the end of the first quarter and were not material to the companys results of operations or financial condition for that period 

beginning in april we experienced a significant deferral of care by our customers the deferral of care moderated over the course of the second quarter with utilization levels eventually returning to nearly normal levels by the end of june in the third quarter we experienced increased medical utilization as we observed a reduction to the level of deferred care and our customers sought care for covid19 testing and treatment 

in the fourth quarter as covid19 cases increased the costs for testing and treatment exceeded the savings related to the deferral of care these impacts were most prevalent in the us medical segment where fourth quarter earnings were adversely impacted by increased costs of covid19 care and decreased contributions from our specialty products full year us medical results reflect covid19 impacts of deferral of care by our customers partially offset by the cost of covid19 care the cost of covid19 related actions including premium relief programs for employer clients cost share waivers for customers customer disenrollment and actions to support providers and employees 

our group disability and other results reflect significantly elevated life insurance claims related to the covid19 pandemic and its effects in the third and fourth quarters quarterly and yeartodate earnings in our evernorth segment also reflected effects of the pandemic specifically a favorable mix of claims as a result of both the type of drugs dispensed as well as the distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling partially offset by lower 30day retail script volume segment results are discussed further in the segment reporting section of this mda and discussion of the impact of covid19 on our investment portfolio and related considerations regarding our investment outlook can be found in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and in the investment assets discussion of this mda 

while it is difficult to predict the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results beyond 2020 we believe that such results may be impacted by among other things higher medical costs to treat those affected by the virus lower customer volumes due to rising unemployment lower future risk adjustment revenue due to disrupted care impeding appropriate documentation of customer risk profiles in our medicare advantage business the return of costs for those who had previously deferred care vaccine costs continued cost share waivers the potential for continued deferral of care or lower investment returns 

cigna has taken actions to enhance our liquidity that combined with our other sources of liquidity described in the liquidity and capital resources outlook section below and our current projections for operating cash flows we believe are sufficient to support our operations and meet our obligations 

the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and we are actively managing our response and assessing impacts to our financial position and operating results as well as adverse developments in our business 

for further information regarding the potential impact of covid19 on the company see “risk factors” contained in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

financial highlights 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our segments unless otherwise specified the commentary provided below describes our results for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 results for 2018 only include express scripts for the period following the acquisition on december 20 2018 

summarized below are certain key measures of our performance by segment for the years ended december 31 



for further analysis and explanation of each segment’s results see the “segment reporting” section of this mda 





commentary 2020 versus 2019 

unless indicated otherwise the commentary presented below and in the segment discussions that follow compare results for the year ended december 31 2020 with results for the year ended december 31 2019 

shareholders’ net income increase was driven by the gain on sale of the group disability and life business lower amortization charges and higher adjusted income from operations partially offset by the absence of earnings from transitioning clients 

adjusted income from operations increased driven in part by higher earnings in the evernorth segment reflecting customer growth and increased script volumes an increase in the international markets segment results and lower interest costs in corporate due to a lower level of outstanding debt these favorable effects were partially offset by lower earnings in the group disability and other segment reflecting significantly elevated life claims related to the effects of covid19 

medical customers decreased due to declines in the middle market and national accounts market segments and increased disenrollment driven by the impacts of covid19 those decreases were partially offset by growth in the select international and medicare advantage segments 

pharmacy revenues increased reflecting the transition of us medicals customers to evernorth higher claims volumes driven by the evernorth collaboration with prime therapeutics and an increase in pricing primarily due to inflation on branded drugs these factors were substantially offset by the absence of revenues from the transitioning clients and to a lesser extent an increase in the generic fill rate see the evernorth segment section of this mda for further discussion of pharmacy revenues 

premiums increased reflecting customer growth in insured products and rate increases reflecting expected medical cost inflation and the return of the health insurance industry tax these factors were partially offset by the impact of premium relief programs implemented in response to significantly lower than historical utilization as customers deferred care in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

fees and other revenues decreased primarily reflecting the transition of us medicals commercial customers to evernorths retail pharmacy network beginning in the third quarter of 2019 see note 3k to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

net investment income decrease was driven by lower yields including lower income from partnership investments due to current economic conditions these effects were partially offset by higher average assets see the investment assets section of this mda for further discussion 

pharmacy and other service costs increased reflecting the transition of us medicals customers to evernorth higher claims volumes driven by the evernorth collaboration with prime therapeutics and an increase in pricing primarily due to inflation on branded drugs these factors were substantially offset by the impact of the absence of the transitioning clients and to a lesser extent effective management of supply chain and the favorable impact of the mix of claims 

medical costs and other benefit expenses increased reflecting both customer growth and direct costs associated with covid19 partially offset by care deferrals in insured products in us medical and higher life claims in group disability and other due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

selling general and administrative expenses were essentially flat primarily reflecting lower charges in 2020 for the organizational efficiency plan and the risk corridors claim recovery recognized in the third quarter of 2020 see the risk mitigation programs  individual aca business section of this mda and note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion offset by the return of the health insurance industry tax 

amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased primarily reflecting lower amortization of customerrelated intangibles associated with the transitioning clients 

income tax expense increased for 2020 largely attributable to the sale of cignas group disability and life business the consolidated effective tax rate decreased slightly driven by recognition of certain incremental federal and state tax benefits largely offset by the return of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax 

key transactions and business developments 

sale of group disability and life business 

as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements cigna sold the us group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for 62 billion on december 31 2020 the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda provides discussion of the use of proceeds from this divestiture 

organizational efficiency plan 

consistent with our commitment to affordability for our customers and clients during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company committed to a plan to increase our organizational alignment and operational efficiency and reduce costs as a result we recognized a charge in selling general and administrative expenses of 207 million pretax 162 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2019 and an additional charge of 31 million pretax 24 million aftertax in the first quarter of 2020 we expect to realize annualized aftertax savings of approximately 200 million a substantial portion of the savings was realized in 2020 

merger with express scripts 

as discussed in more detail in our 2019 form 10k cigna acquired express scripts on december 20 2018 in a cash and stock transaction valued at 528 billion costs related to this transaction are reported in “integration and transactionrelated costs” as a special item and excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of future underlying performance of the business the integration of this acquisition has been completed 

on january 30 2019 anthem a former client exercised its early termination right and terminated its pharmacy benefit management services agreement with us effective march 1 2019 there was a twelvemonth transition period that ended march 1 2020 we excluded the results of express scripts’ contract with anthem and also coventry from our nongaap reporting metrics adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations for 2019 and refer to these clients as transitioning clients as of december 31 2019 the transition was substantially complete therefore beginning in 2020 we no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our reported adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations 

industry developments and other matters 

the business  regulation section of this form 10k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our businesses including regulations issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” and the departments of the treasury and health and human services our businesses continue to operate in a dynamic environment and the laws and regulations applicable to us including the aca continue to be subject to legislative regulatory and judicial challenges the following table provides information on the expected impact of these items and other matters 





risk mitigation programs – individual aca business 

risk corridors in 2016 we recorded an allowance for the balance of our aca risk corridors receivable based on court decisions and the large program deficit on april 27 2020 the us supreme court ruled that insurers are entitled to the full amount due under the risk corridors program the supreme court remanded the cases before it to the lower courts for further proceedings consistent with its opinion we filed a lawsuit in may 2020 seeking payment of these funds we received 120 million in payments in september 2020 which resolved our risk corridors claim 

risk adjustment at the end of each program year the risk adjustment balances are subject to audit by cms through the radv program radv audits for the 2017 and 2018 benefit years have been completed subject to the error rates appeal period final settlement for the 2017 and 2018 benefit years is expected in 2021 and 2022 respectively based on the information currently available we have adjusted our risk adjustment balances to reflect our estimate of expected outcome as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 



1 receivables net of allowances are reported in accounts receivable net in the consolidated balance sheets 

2 payables are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities current in the consolidated balance sheets 

risk adjustment program charges of 26 million pretax were fully offset by radv adjustment favorability of 26 million pretax for 2020 compared with net charges of 162 million pretax 126 million aftertax in 2019 and 147 million pretax 116 million aftertax in 2018 

liquidity and capital resources 



liquidity 

we maintain liquidity at two levels the subsidiary level and the parent company level 

liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of 

• pharmacy medical costs and other benefit payments 

• expense requirements primarily for employee compensation and benefits information technology and facilities costs 

• income taxes and 

• debt service 

our subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by 

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

• using cash flows from operating activities 

• matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities 

• selling investments and 

• borrowing from affiliates subject to applicable regulatory limits 

liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of 

• debt service 

• payment of declared dividends to shareholders 

• lending to subsidiaries as needed and 

• pension plan funding 

the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by 

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments 

• collecting dividends from its subsidiaries 

• using proceeds from issuing debt and common stock and 

• borrowing from its subsidiaries subject to applicable regulatory limits 

dividends from our insurance health maintenance organization “hmo” and foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these restrictions most of evernorths subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory restrictions regarding dividends and therefore provide significant financial flexibility to cigna 

cash flows for the years ended december 31 were as follows 



the following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs premiums fees investment income taxes benefit costs and other expenses 

cash flows from operating activities increased primarily driven by higher pharmacy and services costs payables due to business growth offset by increases in accounts receivable due to business growth higher inventory purchases and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax 

investing and financing activities 

cash flows from investing activities increased primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of the group disability and life business partially offset by higher net investment purchases 

cash used in finance activities increased primarily due to stock repurchases and debt repayments partially offset by higher debt issuance 

we maintain a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors under this program we may repurchase shares from time to time depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and alternate uses of capital the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases in compliance with rule 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including through rule 10b51 trading plans or privately negotiated transactions the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 219 million shares for approximately 41 billion from january 1 2021 through february 24 2021 we repurchased 81 million shares for approximately 17 billion share repurchase authority was 21 billion as of february 24 2021 

capital resources 

our capital resources consist primarily of cash cash equivalents and investments maintained at regulated subsidiaries required to underwrite insurance risks cash flows from operating activities our commercial paper program credit agreements and the issuance of longterm debt and equity securities our businesses generate significant cash flow from operations some of which is subject to regulatory restrictions relative to the amount and timing of dividend payments to parent dividends from us regulated subsidiaries were 23 billion in 2020 and 2019 nonregulated subsidiaries also generate significant cash flow from operating activities which is typically available immediately to parent for general corporate purposes 

we prioritize our use of capital resources to 

• invest in capital expenditures primarily related to technology to support innovative solutions for our customers provide the capital necessary to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to repay debt and fund pension obligations if necessary 

• pay dividends to shareholders 

• consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous and 

• return capital to shareholders through share repurchases 

at december 31 2020 our debttocapitalization ratio was 395 a decline from 452 at december 31 2019 

in connection with the sale of the group disability and life business that closed on december 31 2020 we deployed approximately 30 billion to debt repayment by i repaying in full our 14 billion 364day term loan credit agreement entered into on april 1 2020 on december 31 2020 ii redeeming in full the 10 billion aggregate principal amount of cigna’s senior floating rate notes due 2021 on january 15 2021 at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the indenture governing the notes and iii repaying certain of our outstanding commercial paper balances in january 2021 

in 2018 cigna entered into a 325 billion fiveyear revolving credit agreement and a 30 billion term loan credit agreement in financing the express scripts acquisition the term loan credit agreement was repaid in full and terminated in the fourth quarter of 2019 

in 2019 cigna entered into an additional 10 billion 364day revolving credit agreement that expired in october 2020 at which point we replaced the revolving credit agreement with a new 10 billion 364day revolving credit agreement which will expire in october 2021 

our revolving credit agreements provide us the ability to borrow amounts for general corporate purposes including for purpose of providing liquidity support if necessary under our commercial paper program discussed below as of december 31 2020 there were no outstanding balances under either of the revolving credit agreements 

cigna also maintains a commercial paper program and may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discount basis through certain broker dealers at any time not to exceed 425 billion the net proceeds of issuances have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes the commercial paper program had approximately 10 billion outstanding at december 31 2020 at an average interest rate of 02 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our credit agreements and commercial paper program 

our capital management strategy to support the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations and certain international growth initiatives is to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings generated by our foreign operations this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states 

liquidity and capital resources outlook 

we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs through our cash and cash equivalents balances cash flows from operations commercial paper program credit agreements and the issuance of longterm debt and equity securities as of december 31 2020 we had 425 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our revolving credit agreements which amounts are available for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity support for our commercial paper program 32 billion of remaining capacity under our commercial paper program and 105 billion in cash and shortterm investments approximately 52 billion of which was held by the parent company or certain nonregulated subsidiaries we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy a description of our outstanding debt can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

on january 6 2021 cigna initiated a quarterly cash dividend and declared the first quarterly cash dividend of 100 per share of cigna common stock to be paid on march 25 2021 to shareholders of record as of march 10 2021 cigna currently intends to pay regular quarterly dividends with future declarations subject to approval by its board of directors and the boards determination that the declaration of dividends remains in the best interests of cigna and its shareholders the decision of whether to pay future dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be based on the companys financial position results of operations cash flows capital requirements the requirements of applicable law and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 

as of december 31 2020 our unfunded pension liability was 977 million an increase of 104 million from december 31 2019 primarily attributable to a decrease in discount rates of approximately 80 basis points partially offset by investment asset returns in 2020 we made an immaterial pension contribution as required under the pension protection act of 2006 we expect the required contributions for 2021 to be immaterial see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

risks to our liquidity and capital resources outlook include cash projections that may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the risk factors section of this form 10k though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above the parent company can borrow an additional 17 billion from its subsidiaries without further approvals as of december 31 2020 

guarantees and contractual obligations 

we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business see the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda for additional information on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of various guarantees 



1 amounts include scheduled interest payments and current maturities of longterm debt finance leases are included in longterm debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage servers and equipment see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding finance leases see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our longterm debt 

on balance sheet  

• insurance liabilities excluded from the table above are 4 billion of insurance liabilities 3 billion in contractholder deposit funds 1 billion in future policy benefits associated with the sold retirement benefits individual life insurance and annuity businesses reinsured workers’ compensation as well as the group life and personal accident businesses as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows excluding these amounts the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of 17 billion recorded on the balance sheet this is because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting charges and fees the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above 

◦ contractholder deposit funds see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies 

◦ future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit “gmdb” reported in future policy benefits do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements 

• longterm debt includes scheduled interest payments and current maturities of longterm debt see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding longterm debt finance leases are included in longterm debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage servers and equipment see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding finance leases 

• other noncurrent liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit “gmib” contracts without considering any related reinsurance arrangements pension other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations supplemental and deferred compensation plans interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and reinsurance liabilities estimated payments of 61 million for deferred compensation nonqualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above we expect to make immaterial contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2021 and they are reflected in the above table we expect to make payments subsequent to 2021 for these obligations however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension obligations 

• operating leases see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the table above excludes the liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such future payments in the event we are unable to sustain all of our 12 billion of uncertain tax positions it could result in future tax payments of approximately 900 million see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on uncertain tax positions 

offbalance sheet 

• purchase obligations as of december 31 2020 purchase obligations consisted of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements for future services and investment commitments and they are included in the table below 



1 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements but do not anticipate doing so at this time purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancellable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased 

guarantees 

we are contingently liable for various financial and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 

• changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below we regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates 

as discussed in the executive overview of this mda the covid19 pandemic has pervasively impacted the economy financial markets and the global health care delivery systems if the impact of the covid19 pandemic beyond 2020 is worse than managements current projections these adverse effects to our business could impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units 

in addition to the estimates presented in the following tables there are other accounting estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits as well as estimates with respect to pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions and certain compensation accruals 

management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition the tables below present the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations liquidity or financial condition except for assessing impairment of goodwill 









segment reporting 

the following section of this mda discusses the results of each of our segments see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our segments 

in segment discussions we present adjusted revenues and “pretax adjusted income from operations” defined as income before taxes excluding realized investment gains losses amortization of acquired intangible assets special items and for periods prior to 2020 results of transitioning clients ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as pretax adjusted income from operations see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to pretax adjusted income from operations as well as a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues note 22 to the consolidated financial statements also explains that segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in corporate 

in these segment discussions we also present “pretax adjusted margin” defined as pretax adjusted income from operations divided by adjusted revenues 

as of the third quarter 2020 the segment previously reported as health services is reported as evernorth and the segment previously reported as integrated medical is reported as us medical there are no changes to the underlying business reported in either segment 

see the executive overview section of this mda for summarized financial results of each of our segments

evernorth includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services including pharmacy solutions benefits management solutions care solutions and intelligence solutions as described in the introduction to segment reporting evernorth performance is measured using the below metrics 

• adjusted gross profit and pretax adjusted income from operations which exclude the impact of special items 

• adjusted pharmacy script volume is calculated by multiplying the total nonspecialty network scripts filled through 90day programs and home delivery scripts by three and counting all other network and specialty scripts as one script 

• generic fill rate is defined as the total number of generic scripts divided by the total overall scripts filled generally higher generic fill rates reduce revenues as generic drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace however as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients higher generic fill rates generally have a favorable impact on our gross profit the home delivery generic fill rate is currently lower than the network generic fill rate as fewer generic substitutions are available among maintenance medications such as therapies for chronic conditions commonly dispensed from home delivery pharmacies as compared to acute medications that are primarily dispensed by pharmacies in our retail networks 

the key factors that impact evernorth revenues and costs of revenues are volume mix of claims and price these key factors are discussed further below see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment 

• as our clients’ claim volumes increase or decrease our resulting revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly increase or decrease our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of changes in purchasing discounts 

• the mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling types of drugs can have an impact on our pharmacy revenues pharmacy and other service costs and gross profit including amounts payable under certain financial and performance guarantees with our clients in addition to the types of drugs the mix of generic claims ie generic fill rate also impacts our gross profit furthermore our gross profit differs among network home delivery and specialty distribution methods and can impact our profitability 

• our client contract pricing is impacted by our ongoing ability to negotiate supply chain contracts for pharmacy network pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates as we seek to improve the effectiveness of our integrated solutions for the benefit of our clients we are continuously innovating and optimizing the supply chain our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of supply chain initiatives implemented inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals therefore the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients can affect our revenues and cost of revenues 

in this mda we present revenues and gross profit as well as adjusted revenues and adjusted gross profit consistent with our segment reporting metrics which exclude special items and for periods prior to 2020 contributions from transitioning clients as of december 31 2019 the transition of these clients was substantially complete therefore beginning in 2020 we no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our adjusted metrics see the “key transactions and business developments” section of this form 10k mda for further discussion of transitioning clients and why we present this information

2020 versus 2019 

in the first quarter of 2020 us government operating segment customers transitioned to express scripts’ retail pharmacy network in the third quarter of 2019 us commercial operating segment customers transitioned to express scripts’ retail pharmacy network results of operations for 2018 reflected the results for the period following the acquisition of express scripts on december 20 2018 along with the legacy cigna home delivery business 

adjusted network revenues the increase reflected the transition of us medical’s customers higher claims volume due to our collaboration with prime therapeutics and increased prices due to inflation on branded drugs these favorable effects were partially offset by claims mix due to the increase in the generic fill rate 

adjusted home delivery and specialty revenues the increase reflected higher prices due to inflation on branded drugs and higher home delivery and specialty claims volume these increases were partially offset by claims mix due to an increase in the generic fill rate 

adjusted gross profit the increase reflected customer growth higher adjusted pharmacy script volumes benefits from the effective management of supply chain and the favorable impact of claims mix as a result of the types of drugs dispensed the distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling and an increase in the generic fill rate 

pretax adjusted income from operations the increase reflected customer growth higher adjusted pharmacy scripts volumes benefits from the effective management of supply chain and the favorable impact of claims mix as a result of the types of drugs dispensed the distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling and an increase in the generic fill rate partially offset by an increase in operating expenses due to client transitions 

us medical segment

• selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of adjusted revenues expense ratio 

results of operations 







2020 versus 2019 

adjusted revenues the increase for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with 2019 reflects customer growth in our medicare advantage and us commercial insured businesses as well as higher premium rates due to anticipated underlying medical cost trend and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax these favorable effects were partially offset by the impact of premium relief programs for clients beginning in the second quarter of 2020 in response to significantly lower than historical utilization as individuals deferred care due to the covid19 pandemic 

pretax adjusted income from operations was essentially flat reflecting customer growth in our us commercial insured and medicare advantage businesses and net favorable covid19 related impacts offset by the return of the health insurance industry tax and less favorable prior period development covid19 related impacts include deferral of care by our customers partially offset by direct covid19 costs costs of actions we have taken to support customers providers and employees and increased disenrollment resulting from the economic impacts of the pandemic 

medical care ratio the decrease reflects covid19 related impacts and the pricing effect of the health insurance industry tax covid19 related impacts include deferral of care by our customers partially offset by direct covid19 costs and premium relief programs extended to employer clients 

expense ratio the expense ratio was flat reflecting higher insured revenues as well as efficiencies from continued disciplined expense management and the resumption of the health insurance industry tax 

other items affecting us medical results 

unpaid claims and claim expenses 

our unpaid claims and claim expenses liability was higher as of december 31 2020 compared with december 31 2019 primarily due to customer growth in our medicare advantage and us commercial insured businesses 

medical customers 

our medical customer base decreased at december 31 2020 compared with december 31 2019 reflecting a lower customer base in our middle markets and national accounts segments and increased disenrollment resulting from the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by growth in our select segment and our medicare advantage business 

a medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria 

• is covered under a medical insurance policy managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us 

• has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan or 

• has medical claims that are administered by us 

international markets segment 

as described in the introduction to segment reporting performance of the international markets segment is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations key factors affecting pretax adjusted income from operations for this segment are 

• premium growth including new business and customer retention 

• benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums loss ratio 

• selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues expense ratio and acquisition cost ratio and 

• the impact of foreign currency movements 

results of operations 



2020 versus 2019 

adjusted revenues increased mainly due to business growth in asia and europe partially offset by premium relief programs primarily in europe and unfavorable foreign currency movements 

pretax adjusted income from operations increased reflecting lower acquisition and loss ratios and business growth primarily in asia partially offset by higher expense ratios the ratios in 2020 reflect the costs of actions to support clients additionally the expense ratio reflects actions to support employees and investments in the business for future growth 

the segment’s loss ratio decreased reflecting lower medical utilization due to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by premium relief programs 

the acquisition cost ratio decreased reflecting an update to our commission deferral process and lower acquisition expenses in asia partially offset by premium relief programs 

the expense ratio excluding acquisition costs increased reflecting strategic investments and the unfavorable impact of premium relief programs 

other items related to international markets results 

south korea is the single largest geographic market for our international markets segment for the year ended december 31 2020 south korea generated 38 of the segment’s adjusted revenues and 60 of the segment’s pretax adjusted income from operations 

group disability and other 

group disability and other included for the period presented cigna’s group disability and life business which offered group longterm and shortterm disability and group life accident voluntary and specialty insurance products and services additionally this segment includes corporate owned life insurance “coli” and the company’s runoff operations as described in the introduction of segment reporting performance of group disability and other is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations key factors affecting pretax adjusted income from operations are 

• premium growth including new business and customer retention 

• net investment income 

• benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums loss ratio and 

• selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues excluding net investment income expense ratio 

results of operations 



2020 versus 2019 

adjusted revenues increased due to growth in disability life and voluntary products partially offset by lower investment income 

pretax adjusted income from operations and margin decreased due to unfavorable life claims experience related to the covid19 pandemic unfavorable disability claims experience and lower investment income partially offset by favorable results in our voluntary products 

sale of us group disability and life business as discussed further in the executive overview section of this mda we sold our us group disability and life business on december 31 2020 because this business constituted the vast majority of the segment going forward we would expect a substantial decline in adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations in this segment 

corporate 

corporate reflects amounts not allocated to operating segments including net interest expense defined as interest on corporate debt less net investment income on investments not supporting segment and other operations certain litigation matters expense associated with our frozen pension plans charitable contributions severance certain overhead and project costs and intersegment eliminations for products and services sold between segments 



2020 versus 2019 

pretax adjusted loss from operations was lower reflecting lower interest expense due to lower levels of debt 

investment assets 

the following table presents our investment asset portfolio excluding separate account assets as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 additional information regarding our investment assets is included in notes 11 12 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements 



1 on december 31 2020 cigna completed the sale of its us group disability and life business and transferred a total of 84 billion of investments to new york life insurance company as part of this divestiture the investment assets transferred to new york life were primarily debt securities and to a lesser extent commercial mortgage loans the table above includes 77 billion as of december 31 2019 of investments associated with this business that was previously held for sale 

debt securities 

investments in debt securities include publiclytraded and privatelyplaced bonds mortgage and other assetbacked securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on our balance sheet additional information regarding valuation methodologies key inputs and controls is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements more detailed information about debt securities by type of issuer and maturity dates is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table reflects our portfolio of debt securities by type of issuer as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 



as a result of the us group disability and life business divestiture 78 billion of debt securities were transferred to new york life on december 31 2020 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information the debt securities transferred to new york life were primarily corporate and state and local government sectors this decrease in our debt securities portfolio was partially offset by an increase in valuations due to decreasing yields and net purchase activity during the year 

as of december 31 2020 156 billion or 86 of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade baa and above or equivalent and the remaining 25 billion were below investment grade the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the noninvestment grade spectrum although our allocation to below investment grade bonds has increased since the prior year these quality characteristics have not otherwise changed materially from the prior year and remain consistent with our investment strategy 

investments in debt securities are diversified by issuer geography and industry as appropriate on an aggregate basis the debt securities portfolio continues to perform according to original investment expectations however due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic there are certain issuers particularly within the aviation energy and hospitality sectors that are showing signs of distress primarily in the form of requests for temporary covenant relief there were no material unrealized losses in any of these sectors as of the reporting date we continue to monitor the economic environment and its effect on our portfolio and consider the impact of various factors in determinin g the allowance for credit losses on debt securities which is discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign government obligations are concentrated in asia primarily south korea consistent with our risk management practice and local regulatory requirements of our international business operations corporate debt securities include private placement assets of 60 billion these investments are generally less marketable than publiclytraded bonds however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publiclytraded bonds with comparable credit risk we perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions if warranted 

commercial mortgage loans 

as of december 31 2020 the 14 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 45 loans that are in good standing our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans diversified by property type location and borrower given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash invested generally ranging between 30 and 40 we remain confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms for further discussion of the results and changes in key loan metrics see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

as a result of the us group disability and life business divestiture 06 billion of commercial mortgage loans were transferred to new york life on december 31 2020 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information loans are secured by high quality commercial properties located in strong institutional markets and are generally made at less than 65 of the property’s value at origination of the loan property value debt service coverage quality building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans 

covid19 has negatively impacted commercial real estate fundamentals and capital market activity with concentrated weakness in hotels and regional malls our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified by property type and geography with no material exposure to hotels and no exposure to regional shopping malls we continue to monitor the longterm impacts on the office sector due to growing headwinds expanded remote working flexibility shorter term leases and corporate migration to lower cost states our mortgage loans secured by office properties are in good standing 

other longterm investments 

other longterm investments of 28 billion as of december 31 2020 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships direct investments in real estate joint ventures and other deposit activity that is required to support various insurance and health services businesses the increase in other longterm investments is driven by net new funding activity these limited partnership entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privatelyheld companies and equity real estate given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns to mitigate risk these investments are diversified across approximately 175 separate partnerships and approximately 90 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships also the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region no single partnership investment exceeded 4 of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio 

income from our limited partnership investments is generally reported on a one quarter lag due to the timing of when financial information is received from the general partner or manager of the investments we could experience losses into future periods but the magnitude of these losses will depend in part on the length and extent of the economic disruption the speed of the recovery and the overall economic impacts 

we participate in an insurance joint venture in china with a 50 ownership interest we account for this joint venture on the equity method of accounting and report our share of the net assets of 08 billion in other assets our 50 share of the investment portfolio supporting the joint ventures business is approximately 56 billion primarily invested in chinese corporate and government debt securities diversified by issuer industry and geography as appropriate to a lesser extent and consistent with its investment strategy the joint venture is invested in chinese equity investments comprised of approximately 50 equity mutual funds with the remainder invested in equity securities and private equity partnerships we participate in the approval of the joint ventures investment strategy and continuously review its execution there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31 2020 

investment outlook 

the impact of covid19 on the economy despite unprecedented monetary and fiscal support and the uncertainty as to the strength and sustainability of the recovery prior to a widely available vaccine continues to dominate financial markets the low interest rate environment continues to pressure income from both shortterm and longerterm investments us treasury rates remain near alltime lows and the wider market credit spreads experienced during the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 have meaningfully narrowed resulting in historically low yields for investment grade assets we continue to actively monitor the economic impact of the pandemic as well as fiscal and monetary responses and their potential impact on the portfolio net investment income projections into 2021 reflect continued market volatility and portfolio impacts particularly in certain sectors such as aviation hospitality and energy as well as other areas most severely impacted by covid19 future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date these future conditions are not reasonably predictable however we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the longterm although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investmentspecific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

market risk 

financial instruments 

our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices consistent with disclosure requirements the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments 

• changes in the fair values of insurancerelated assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk 

• changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets and 

• changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill deferred policy acquisition costs taxes and various accrued liabilities because they are not financial instruments their primary risks are other than market risk 

excluding these items our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are 

• interestrate risk on fixedrate mediumterm instruments changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return 

• foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar net of derivatives used for hedging is primarily to the south korean won chinese yuan renminbi and new zealand dollar an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 

our management of market risks 

we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk 

• investmentliability matching we generally select investment assets with characteristics such as duration yield currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations shorterterm investments generally support shorterterm life and health liabilities mediumterm fixedrate investments support interestsensitive and health liabilities longerterm investments generally support products with longer payout periods such as annuities 

• use of local currencies for foreign operations  we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies this technique limits exchange rate risk to our net assets 

• use of derivatives we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our primary market risks see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments 

effect of market fluctuations 

assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and 10 strengthening in the us dollar to foreign currencies the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities would have been as follows as of december 31 



the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates primarily on debt securities and commercial mortgage loans was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models primarily duration modeling the decrease in our sensitivity to market interest rates since the prior year is primarily due to our decreased interest sensitive investment portfolio base due to the transfer of debt securities and commercial mortgage loans to new york life on december 31 2020 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the divestiture of our us group disability and life business 

in the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the fair value of the company’s longterm debt would decrease approximately 30 billion at december 31 2020 and 25 billion at december 31 2019 changes in the fair value of our longterm debt do not impact our financial position or operating results see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s debt 

the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10 of the fair value of these instruments translated to the us dollar our foreign operations hold investment assets such as debt securities cash and cash equivalents that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities

competition 

  

the principal competitive factors that affect the group disability and life segment are underwriting and pricing the quality and effectiveness of claims management relative operating efficiency investment and risk management distribution methodologies and producer relations the breadth and variety of products and services offered the quality of customer service and more importantly the state of the tools and technology available for customers clients consultants and producers for certain products with longerterm liabilities such as group longterm disability insurance the financial strength of the insurer as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies is also a competitive factor 

  

 national insurers unum the hartford prudential financial lincoln financial group and metlife compete with us on a variety of products and regions throughout the united states 

  

industry developments 

  

employers have expressed a growing interest in employee wellness absence management and productivity and recognize a strong link between employee health productivity and profitability 

  

the group insurance market remains highly competitive as the rising cost of medical coverage has forced companies to reevaluate their overall employee benefit spending resulting in lower volumes of group disability and life insurance business and more competitive pricing 

  

over the past few years there has been heightened review by state regulators of the claims handling practices within the disability and life insurance industry this has resulted in an increase in coordinated multistate examinations that target specific market practices in addition to regularly recurring examinations of an insurer’s overall operations conducted by an individual state’s regulators we have been subject to such an examination over the past several years 

  

the lower level of interest rates in the united states over the last several years has constrained earnings growth in this segment due to lower yields on our fixedincome investments and higher benefit expenses resulting from the discounting of future claim payments at lower interest rates

regulation 

  

the laws and regulations governing our business continue to increase each year and are subject to frequent change we are regulated by federal state and international legislative bodies and agencies which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact the health care system the us 2020 presidential and state elections likely will fuel continued legislative and regulatory debate of issues related to our businesses 

  

many aspects of our business are directly regulated by federal and state laws and administrative agencies such as the department of health and human services “hhs” centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” the internal revenue service “irs” the us departments of labor “dol” the office of personnel management “opm” treasury and justice “doj” the federal trade commission “ftc” the us securities and exchange commission “sec” the office of the national coordinator for health information technology state departments of insurance and state boards of pharmacy our business practices may also be shaped by judicial decisions 

  

in addition aspects of our business are subject to indirect regulation the selffunded benefit plans sponsored by our us employer clients are regulated under federal law these selffunded clients expect us to assure that our administration of their plans complies with the regulatory requirements applicable to them 

  

our business operations and the books and records of our regulated businesses are routinely subject to examination and audit at regular intervals by state insurance and hmo regulatory agencies state boards of pharmacy cms dol irs opm and comparable international regulators to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations our operations are also subject to nonroutine examinations audits and investigations by various state and federal regulatory agencies generally as the result of a complaint in addition we may be implicated in investigations of our clients whose group benefit plans we administer on their behalf as a result we routinely receive subpoenas and other demands or requests for information from various state insurance and hmo regulatory agencies state attorneys general the office of inspector general “oig” the doj the dol and other state federal and international authorities we may also be called upon by members of the us congress to provide information including testifying before congressional committees and subcommittees regarding certain of our business practices if cigna is determined to have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations these examinations investigations reviews subpoenas and demands may 

  

• result in fines penalties injunctions consent orders or loss of licensure 

• suspend or exclude from participation in government programs or limit our ability to sell or market our products 

• require changes in business practices 

• damage relationships with the agencies that regulate us and affect our ability to secure regulatory approvals necessary for the operation of our business or 

• damage our brand and reputation 

  

our international subsidiaries are subject to regulations in international jurisdictions including in certain case many regulations similar to the federal and state regulations described below which are complex and where foreign insurers may face more rigorous regulations than their domestic competitors and may also be affected by geopolitical developments or tensions 

  

the laws and regulations governing our business as well as the related interpretations are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other changes in our business environment are likely to continue as elected and appointed officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to existing laws and regulations even where we believe that we are in compliance with the various laws and regulations any enforcement actions by federal state or international government officials alleging noncompliance with these rules and regulations could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with these laws and regulations see the risk factors section located in part 1 item 1a of this form 10k management continues to be actively engaged with regulators and policymakers with respect to legislation and rulemaking see the “executive overview – health care industry developments and other matters affecting our integrated medical and health services segments” section of our mda located in part ii item 7 of this form 10k for a discussion of the anticipated impact of certain recent industry developments 

  

patient protection and the affordable care act “aca” 

the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” mandated broad changes to the us health care system including insured and selfinsured health benefit plans and pharmacy benefit managers our business model is impacted by the aca including our relationships with current and future producers and health care providers products service providers and technologies key provisions of the aca include the imposition of a nontax deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments on health insurers and the creation of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small group employers to purchase insurance coverage the aca also implemented minimum medical loss ratios “mlrs” for our medicare and commercial businesses certain states have adopted mlr requirements applicable to our commercial businesses that are more stringent than those established by the aca other provisions of the aca in effect include reduced medicare advantage premium rates the requirement to cover preventive services with no enrollee costsharing banning the use of lifetime and annual limits on the dollar amount of essential health benefits increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage extending coverage of dependents up to age 26 restrictions on differential pricing enforcement mechanisms and rules related to health care fraud and abuse enforcement activities and certain pharmacy benefit transparency requirements the employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more fulltime employees to offer affordable health insurance that provides minimum value each as defined under the aca to fulltime employees and their dependents including 

children up to age 26 or be subject to penalties based on employer size the aca also changed certain tax laws to effectively limit tax deductions for certain employee compensation paid by health insurers in december 2019 the federal government repealed the nondeductible health insurance industry fee effective for 2021 as well as repealing the enacted but never implemented 40 excise tax on certain employersponsored coverage known as the “cadillac tax” and the medical device tax 

  

since its adoption there have been several attempts to repeal or limit the utility of the aca certain insurers have sued the federal government for failure to pay costsharing subsidies under the aca the matter remains unresolved and we continue to monitor developments in december 2017 us tax reform legislation was signed into law that among other things reduced the “individual mandate” penalty for individuals without health insurance to zero dollars effective january 1 2019 as a result of this change a federal district court has ruled that the “individual mandate” is unconstitutional on appeal the court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed that the “individual mandate” is unconstitutional but ordered the district court to reexamine whether the other provisions of the aca can remain in effect thereby leaving in doubt whether the entire aca is unconstitutional until there is a final judicial determination on appeal 

  

additionally in 2017 the current administration issued an executive order asking the dol to revise the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended “erisa” regulations to make it easier for employers particularly small employers to associate for the purpose of sponsoring large group health plans and thereby avoid the aca’s small group market reform eg communityrating and mandated coverage of essential health benefits that impaired the affordability of providing health coverage to their employees in the spring of 2018 the dol issued final rules that revised the definition of “employer” in the erisa rules to make it easier for employers including selfemployed individuals to form bona fide employer groups all of whose employees would be counted in determining whether they were small or large groups for purposes of the aca while the regulation of these groupings by state insurance departments is not affected by the dol’s final association health plan rules the final rules have resulted in an increase in interest among employers associations producers and benefit consultants in forming new groupings for purposes of offering insured or selffunded group health plans 

  

see also the “executive overview” section of our mda of this form 10k for more information additionally see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding accounting policies around the risk mitigation programs under the aca 

  

medicare and medicaid regulations 

  

through our subsidiaries we offer individual and group medicare advantage medicare pharmacy “part d” and medicare supplement products we also provide medicare part drelated products and services to other medicare part d sponsors medicare advantage prescription drug plans and employers and clients offering medicare part d benefits to medicare part d eligible beneficiaries as part of our medicare advantage and medicare part d business we contract with cms to provide services to medicare beneficiaries as a result our ability to obtain payment and the determination of the amount of such payments market to enroll and retain customers and expand into new service areas is subject to compliance with cms’ numerous and complex regulations and requirements that are frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion review and enforcement we offer medicaid and dualeligible products and participate in state medicaid programs directly or indirectly through our clients who are medicaid managed care contractors we also perform certain medicaid subrogation services and certain delegated services including utilization management for clients which are regulated by federal and state laws our medicaid and dualeligible products are regulated by cms and state medicaid agencies audit our performance to determine compliance with contracts and regulations 

  

cms evaluates medicare advantage plans and part d plans under its “star rating” system the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including for example quality of care preventive services chronic illness management coverage determinations and appeals and customer satisfaction a plan’s star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform very well are able to offer enhanced benefits and market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans medicare advantage plans’ qualitybonus payments are determined by the star rating with plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for such payments the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve and maintain four stars or greater 

  

cms uses a riskadjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to customers’ health status the riskadjustment model generally pays more where a plans membership has higher than expected costs under this model rates paid to medicare advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard medicarecovered benefits to an enrollee with a “national average risk profile” that baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership under the riskadjustment methodology medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are employees to code their claim submission with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the 

basis for our payments received under the actuarial riskadjustment model the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to the plans which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government feeforservice program in 2012 cms released a payment methodology that provided for sample audit error rates to be extrapolated to the entire medicare advantage contract after comparing audit results with a similar audit of medicare fee for service the “ffs adjuster” and applying an ffs adjuster to establish actuarial equivalency in payment rates as required by the medicare statute however a methodology to calculate the ffs adjuster was not finalized and cms has to date not completed any risk adjustment data validation “radv” audits using extrapolation see below under “federal and state oversight of governmentsponsored health care programs” for a discussion of radv audits 

  

on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule titled “proposed rule on changes to ma and part d programs for cy 2020 and 2021” that would revise its radv methodology for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years by among other things extrapolating radv results at the contract level without applying the ffs adjuster the company along with other medicare advantage organizations and additional interested parties submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process the comment period concluded on august 28 2019 it is uncertain whether cms will finalize the rule as proposed 

  

coverage of prescription drugs under medicare part d is also regulated by cms and our contracts with cms contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk these provisions affect our ultimate payments from cms for example premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor payments which compare costs targeted in our annual bids with actual prescription costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the payments we received known as a risk corridor 

  

in february 2019 cms proposed rules to support the seamless and secure access exchange and use of electronic health information in the proposed rules cms proposes requirements that medicaid the children’s health insurance program medicare advantage plans and qualified health plans in the federallyfacilitated exchanges provide enrollees with immediate electronic access to medical claims and other health information electronically by 2020 this proposed rule is subject to revision through a comment process the company submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process and the comment period concluded on june 3 2019 

  

on february 5 2020 cms released a proposed rule titled “medicare and medicaid programs contract year 2021 and 2022 policy and technical changes to the medicare advantage program medicare prescription drug benefit program medicaid program medicare cost plan program and programs of allinclusive care for the elderly” that proposes changes to special needs plans flexibility in the use of specialty tiers in medicare part d creation of a beneficiary realtime benefit tool and modification of certain network adequacy rules the proposed rule also includes several changes to the stars rating system including creation of several new measures retirement of one existing measure changes to the relative measure weighting and revision of the methodology for assigning individual measure ratings the proposed rule is subject to revision through the comment process 

  

we expect cms oig doj and other federal agencies to continue to closely scrutinize each component of the medicare advantage program and modify the terms and requirements of the program noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant consequences including fines and penalties enrollment sanctions exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs limitations on expansion and criminal penalties 

  

see also the “executive overview” section of our mda of this form 10k for more information 

  

false claims act and antikickback laws 

  

our products and services are also subject to the federal false claims act the “false claims act” and federal and state antikickback laws additionally the federal government has made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks in return for customer referrals billing for unnecessary medical services upcoding and improper marketing the regulations and contractual requirements in this area are complex frequently modified and subject to administrative discretion and judicial interpretation 

  

false claims act and related criminal provisions the false claims act imposes civil penalties on any person who makes or causes to be made claims or records or statements that he or she knows or should know are false with respect to governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid to obtain reimbursement or for failure to return overpayments private individuals may bring qui tam or “whistleblower” suits against providers under the false claims act which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit the aca amended the federal antikickback laws to state any claim submitted to a federal or state health care program that violates the antikickback laws is also a false claim under the false claims act the false claims act generally 

provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages creating the possibility of substantial financial liabilities criminal statutes similar to the false claims act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement it knows to be false fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency the corporation may be fined conviction under these statutes may also result in exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs many states have also enacted laws similar to the false claims act some of which may include criminal penalties substantial fines and treble damages 

  

antikickback and referral laws subject to certain exceptions and “safe harbors” the federal antikickback statute generally prohibits among other things knowingly and willfully paying receiving or offering any payment or other remuneration to induce a person to purchase lease order or arrange for items including prescription drugs or services reimbursable in whole or in part under medicare medicaid or another federal health care program many states have similar laws some of which are not limited to items or services paid for with government funds sanctions for violating these federal and state antikickback laws may include criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs 

  

antikickback laws have been cited as a partial basis along with state consumer protection laws described below for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies or payors in connection with “product conversion” or promotion programs other antikickback laws may be applicable to arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers such as the public contracts antikickback act the erisa health plan antikickback statute the federal “stark law” and various state antikickback restrictions 

  

federal civil monetary penalties law  the federal civil monetary penalty statute provides for civil monetary penalties against any person who gives something of value to a medicare or medicaid program beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider for medicare or medicaid items or services under this law our whollyowned home delivery pharmacies specialty pharmacies and home health providers are restricted from offering certain items of value to influence a medicare or medicaid patient’s use of services the aca also includes several civil monetary provisions such as penalties for the failure to report and return a known overpayment and failure to grant timely access to the oig under certain circumstances 

  

federal and state oversight of governmentsponsored health care programs 

  

participation in governmentsponsored health care programs subjects us to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under these programs these audits may occur years after the provision of services risks include potential fines and penalties restrictions on our ability to participate or expand our presence in certain programs and restrictions on marketing our plans for example with respect to our medicare advantage business cms and the oig perform audits to determine a health plan’s compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including program audits and risk adjustment data validation audits or “radv audits” which focus on compliance with proper coding practices certain of our contracts are currently subject to radv audits by cms and the oig cms has announced its intent to use thirdparty auditors to audit all medicare advantage contracts by either a comprehensive or a targeted radv review for each contract year the doj is also currently conducting an industrywide investigation of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes including review of medical charts of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

for our medicare part d business compliance with fraud and abuse enforcement practices is monitored through recovery audit contractor audits in which thirdparty contractors conduct postpayment reviews on a contingency fee basis to detect and correct improper payments 

  

government procurement regulations 

  

we have a contract with the us department of defense “dod” which subjects us to applicable federal acquisition regulations “far” and the dod far supplement which govern federal government contracts further there are other federal and state laws applicable to our dod arrangement and our arrangements with other clients that may be subject to government procurement regulations in addition certain of our clients participate as contracting carriers in the federal employees health benefits program administered by the office of personnel management which includes various pharmacy benefit management standards 

  

employee retirement income security act 

  

our domestic subsidiaries sell most of their products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by erisa erisa is a complex set of federal laws and regulations enforced by the irs and the dol as well as the courts erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationship between us the employers that maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to erisa and participants in such plans certain of our domestic subsidiaries are also subject to requirements imposed by erisa affecting claim 

payment and appeals procedures for individual health insurance and insured and selfinsured group health plans and for the insured dental disability life and accident plans we administer certain of our domestic subsidiaries also may contractually agree to comply with these requirements on behalf of the selfinsured dental disability life and accident plans they administer we believe the conduct of our pharmacy benefit management business is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of erisa however there can be no assurances that the dol may not assert that pharmacy benefit managers are fiduciaries from time to time states have considered legislation to declare a pharmacy benefit manager or health benefit manager a fiduciary with respect to its clients 

  

plans subject to erisa can also be subject to state laws and the legal question of whether and to what extent erisa preempts a state law will continue to be subject to court interpretation 

  

privacy security and data standards regulations 

  

many of our activities involve the receipt or use of confidential health and other personal information in addition we use aggregated and deidentified data for our own research and analysis purposes and in some cases provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators there are also industry standards for handling credit card data known as the payment card industry data security standard which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements for using and disclosing personal information 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations “hipaa” impose minimum standards on health insurers pharmacy benefit managers hmos health plans health care providers and clearinghouses for the privacy and security of protected health information hipaa regulations may also hold us liable for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers hipaa also established rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions including but not limited to eligibility and claims 

  

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act “hitech” imposes additional contracting requirements for covered entities the extension of privacy and security provisions to business associates the requirement to provide notification to various parties in the event of a data breach of protected health information and enhanced financial penalties for hipaa violations including potential criminal penalties for individuals in the conduct of our business depending on the circumstances we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate 

  

the federal grammleachbliley act and its implementing regulations generally places restrictions on the disclosure of nonpublic information to nonaffiliated third parties and requires financial institutions including insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures state departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law 

  

state and local authorities are increasingly focused on protecting individuals from identity theft and a number of states have adopted data security laws and regulations requiring certain minimum data security standards and security breach notifications that may apply to us in certain circumstances neither hipaa nor the grammleachbliley privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which went into effect in january 2020 provides additional privacy rights for california residents although it generally does not apply to certain regulated data such as information covered by hipaa 

  

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 “cisa” encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry states have also begun to issue regulations specifically related to cybersecurity which may differ or conflict from state to state in october 2017 the national association of insurance commissioners “naic” an organization of state insurance regulators adopted the insurance data security model law that creates rules for insurers and other covered entities addressing data security investigation and notification of breaches this includes maintaining an information security program based on ongoing risk assessment overseeing thirdparty service providers investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event as the model law is intended to serve as model legislation only states will need to enact legislation for the model law to become mandatory and enforceable we will continue to monitor states’ activity regarding cybersecurity regulation 

  

in addition international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of personal information can be more stringent than in the united states and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective may 2018 enhanced or created obligations regarding the handling of personal data relating to european residents such as regarding notices data protection impact assessments and individual rights and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance than the previous european directive or laws in addition many countries outside of europe where we 

conduct business have implemented or may implement data protection laws and regulations some of which include requirements modeled after those in the gdpr 

see part 1 item 1a “risk factors” for a discussion of the risks related to compliance with privacy and security regulations 

  

consumer protection laws 

we engage in directtoconsumer activities and are increasingly offering mobile and webbased solutions to our customers we are therefore subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and other consumer protection laws and regulations such as the telephone consumer protection act and the canspam act the ftc is also increasingly exercising its enforcement authority in the areas of consumer privacy and data security with a focus on webbased mobile data and “big data” federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information 

  

most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs such statutes have also been cited as the basis for claims or investigations by state attorneys general relative to privacy and data security 

  

office of foreign assets control sanctions and antimoney laundering 

  

we are also subject to regulation by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes based on us foreign policy and national security goals certain of our products are subject to the department of the treasury antimoney laundering regulations under the bank secrecy act in addition we are subject to similar regulations in nonus jurisdictions in which we operate 

  

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

  

many states in which our subsidiaries operate limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed health care providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business 

  

laws and legislation affecting plan design and pharmacy network access 

some states have enacted laws that prohibit managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive benefit plan design features and many states have laws or have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to the pharmacy benefit for example some states under socalled “freedom of choice” legislation provide customers of the plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers some states have also enacted legislation that can negatively impact the use of costsaving network configurations for plan sponsors other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering customers financial incentives for use of home delivery pharmacies medicare and some states have issued guidance and regulations that limit our ability to fill or refill prescriptions electronically submitted by a physician to our home delivery pharmacy without first obtaining consent from the patient such restrictions generate additional costs and limit our ability to maximize efficiencies which could otherwise be gained through the electronic prescription and automatic refill processes legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention or to require coverage of all food and drug administration approved drugs other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and require health plan coverage of specific drugs if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician states are also standardizing the process for and restricting the use of utilization management rules and shortening the time frames within which prescription drug prior authorization determinations must be made even where states do not regulate pharmacy benefit or utilization management companies directly these laws will apply to many of our clients including managed care organizations and health insurers 

  

additionally medicare part d and a majority of states now have laws regulations or some form of legislation affecting our ability or our clients’ ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove a provider from a network such laws regulations or 

legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy or provider willing to meet the plan’s terms and conditions for network participation “any willing provider” or may direct that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures “due process” 

  

certain states have laws prohibiting certain pharmacy benefit management clients from imposing additional copayments deductibles limitations on benefits or other conditions on covered individuals utilizing a retail pharmacy when the same conditions are not otherwise imposed on covered individuals utilizing home delivery pharmacies however the laws require the retail pharmacy to agree to the same reimbursement amounts and terms and conditions as are imposed on the home delivery pharmacies an increase in the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies may have a negative impact on the number of prescriptions filled through home delivery 

  

pharmacy benefit management and drug pricing regulation 

  

our pharmacy benefit management services are subject to numerous laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern and proposed legislation and regulations may govern critical practices including disclosure receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers the receipt and retention of transmission fees from contracted pharmacies use of administration of or changes to drug formularies the use and disclosure of maximum allowable cost pricing or clinical programs “most favored nation” pricing which provides that a pharmacy participating in a specific government program must give the program the best price the pharmacy makes available to any thirdparty plan disclosure of data to third parties drug utilization management practices the level of duty a pharmacy benefit manager owes its clients or customers configuration of pharmacy networks the operations of our subsidiary pharmacies disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates disclosure of negotiated drug rebates calculation of customer costshare for prescription drug claims pricing that includes differential or spread ie a difference between the drug price charged to the plan sponsor by a pharmacy benefit manager and the price paid by the manager to the dispensing provider disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to customers’ drug utilization and registration or licensing of pharmacy benefit managers 

  

the us congress current administration and states will continue to prioritize means of addressing outofpocket costs for consumers particularly related to prescription drug costs policy proposals vary broadly in their approaches to achieve that goal and range from proposing the creation of an international pricing index to which us drug pricing would be benchmarked reforming the us food and drug administration regulatory processes and patent laws in order to accelerate the arrival of generics biosimilars and clinically equivalent competition to the market enabling states to import lower priced prescription drugs into the united states or expanding the role of the federal or state governments to negotiate pricing of prescription drugs directly with manufacturers additionally proposals at the federal and state levels consider increased regulation of pharmacy benefit managers and health plans as a means to limit consumer out of pocket costs including proposing to limit the use of various pharmacy benefit management tools mandating the treatment of fees discounts or financing mechanisms that otherwise are set in private contractual terms increasing supply chain transparency expanding regulatory requirements or definitions of fiduciaries or mandating plan benefit designs that cap consumer outofpocket expense 

  

prescription drug pricing and the role of pharmacy benefit managers have been a focus of the current administration in may 2018 the current administration announced a blueprint titled “american patients first” which outlines a variety of approaches that could be adopted to lower prescription drug costs in the united states proposed rules regarding revisions to the federal antikickback safe harbor were rescinded in july 2019 in october 2018 congress enacted laws that prohibited pharmacy benefit managers and insurers from restricting pharmacies from providing drug pricing information to a plan enrollee when there is a difference between the cost of the drug under insurance and the cost of the drug when purchased without insurance while the other issues raised in the blueprint continue to be the subject of legislative and regulatory discussion formal policies and requirements have not been finalized in any form 

  

some states have enacted statutes regulating the use of maximum allowable cost “mac” pricing these statutes referred to as “mac transparency laws” generally require pharmacy benefit managers to disclose specific information related to mac pricing to pharmacies and provide certain appeal rights for pharmacies mac transparency laws also restrict the application of mac and may require operational changes to maintain compliance with the law some states have also enacted laws regulating pharmacy pricing and protecting the profitability of pharmacies for dispensing certain macpriced drugs some states have enacted laws requiring that the customer costshare for a prescription drug claim not exceed certain price points such as the pharmacy’s usual and customary charge or its contracted reimbursement for the drug 

  

in march 2018 the naic adopted changes to the health carrier prescription drug benefit management model act the changes address issues relating to i transparency accuracy and disclosure regarding prescription drug formularies and formulary changes during a policy year ii accessibility of prescription drug benefits using a variety of pharmacy options and iii tiered prescription drug formularies and discriminatory benefit design while the actions of the naic do not have the force of law they are used as a 

template to influence states to adopt laws based on the model legislation we are expecting an enhanced naic model act on pharmacy benefit manager licensure and regulation to be adopted by the naic in late 2020 

  

the federal medicaid drug rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs reimbursed through state medicaid programs including through medicaid managed care organizations manufacturers of brandname products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a 231 of the average manufacturer price “amp” paid by retail community pharmacies or by wholesalers for certain drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies or b the difference between amp and the “best price” available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program and certain other government programs with certain exceptions we negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and in certain circumstances sell services to drug manufacturers investigations are being and have been conducted by certain government entities which call into question whether a drug’s “best price” was properly calculated and reported with respect to rebates paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for such calculations reports or payments 

  

pharmacy regulation 

our home delivery and specialty pharmacies also subject us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy we are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the states in which our pharmacies are located most of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require outofstate home delivery pharmacies to register with or be licensed by the board of pharmacy or a similar regulatory body in the state these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state where the pharmacy is located although some states require compliance with certain laws in that state as it impacts or relates to drugs distributed or dispensed into those states 

our various pharmacy facilities also provide services under certain medicare and state medicaid programs participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs in addition several of our pharmacy facilities are participating providers under medicare part d and are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to medicare part d additionally we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our medicare plans and intercompany pricing between our plans and our pharmacy business 

  

other statutes and regulations affect our home delivery and specialty pharmacy operations including the federal and state antikickback laws and the federal civil monetary penalty law described above federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising adulteration and security of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances and certain of our pharmacies must register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities the ftc requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the product to be sold to fill mail orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate the united states postal service also has significant statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail 

  

financial reporting internal control and corporate governance 

  

regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and hmos states regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements the type and concentration of permitted investments and corporate governance over financial reporting our insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports and schedules with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which they do business as well as annual financial statements audited by independent registered public accounting firms certain insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file an annual report of internal control over financial reporting with most jurisdictions in which they do business insurance and hmo subsidiaries’ operations and financial statements are subject to examination by such agencies many states have expanded regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of insurance and hmo subsidiaries as a result of model regulations adopted by the naic with elements similar to corporate governance and risk oversight disclosure requirements under federal securities laws 

  

guaranty associations indemnity funds risk pools and administrative funds 

  

most states and certain nonus jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds that are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies some states have similar laws relating to hmos and other payors such as consumer operated and oriented plans coops established under the aca in the united states these associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims certain states require hmos to participate in guaranty funds special risk pools and administrative funds for additional information about guaranty funds and other assessments see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

certain states continue to require health insurers and hmos to participate in assigned risk plans joint underwriting authorities pools or other residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards although some states have eliminated these requirements as a result of the aca 

  

solvency and capital requirements 

  

many states have adopted some form of the naic model solvencyrelated laws and riskbased capital “rbc” rules for life and health insurance companies and hmos the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred if the ratio of the insurer’s adjusted surplus to its rbc falls below statutorily required minimums the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 

  

in addition various nonus jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency liquidity and reserve coverage measures our hmos and life and health insurance subsidiaries as well as nonus insurance subsidiaries are compliant with applicable rbc and nonus surplus rules 

  

the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act “orsa” adopted by the naic provides requirements and principles for maintaining a group solvency assessment and a risk management framework and reflects a broader approach to us insurance regulation orsa includes a requirement to file an annual orsa summary report in the lead state of domicile to date an overwhelming majority of the states have adopted the same or similar versions of orsa we file our orsa report annually as required 

  

holding company laws 

our domestic insurance companies and certain of our hmos are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies under such laws certain dividends distributions and other transactions between an insurance company or an hmo subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to or approval by one or more state insurance commissioners in addition the holding company acts of states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo subsidiary without prior regulatory approval state holding company laws and regulations also subject our insurance companies and certain hmo subsidiaries to additional regulatory scrutiny related to their oversight of affiliates performing regulated services on behalf of the insurance company or hmo and require the company to file an annual enterprise risk report which summarizes material risks that could pose enterprise risk to the insurance company subsidiaries 

  

marketing advertising and products 

  

in most states our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are required to certify compliance with applicable advertising regulations on an annual basis our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are also required by most states to file and secure regulatory approval of products prior to the marketing advertising and sale of such products 

  

licensing and registration requirements 

our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries must be licensed by the jurisdictions in which they conduct business additionally certain subsidiaries contract to provide claim administration utilization management and other related services for the administration of selfinsured benefit plans these subsidiaries may be subject to state thirdparty administration and other licensing requirements and regulation as well as thirdparty accreditation requirements 

we have received full accreditation for utilization review accreditation commission pharmacy benefit management version 22 standards which includes quality standards for drug utilization management and select subsidiaries have received full accreditation for utilization review accreditation commission for health utilization management version 72 which includes quality standards for medical utilization management 

  

certain states have adopted pharmacy benefit management registration or disclosure laws in addition to registration laws some states have adopted legislation mandating disclosure of various aspects of our financial practices including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms 

our international subsidiaries are often required to be licensed when entering new markets or starting new operations in certain jurisdictions the licensure requirements for these subsidiaries vary by country and are subject to change 

  

international regulations 

our operations outside the united states expose us to laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies and regulators including those related to the provision of insurance financial and other disclosures the provision of health carerelated services corporate governance privacy data protection data mining data transfer intellectual property labor and employment consumer protection directtoconsumer communications activities tax anticorruption and antimoney laundering foreign laws and rules may include requirements that are different from or more stringent than similar requirements in the united states 

  

our operations in countries outside the united states 

• are subject to local regulations of the jurisdictions where we operate 

• in some cases are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions where customers reside and 

• in all cases are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” 

  

in particular in south korea regulators are focused on protecting the rights of individual customers by enforcing “treating customers fairly” concepts this regulatory focus has resulted in rigorous data localization requirements network separation obligations and system monitoring restrictions as well as obligations to closely monitor marketing communications and sales scripts antimoney laundering requirements in south korea and other countries where we do business also may impose obligations to collect certain information about each customer at time of sale or to risk rank each customer to determine possible future money laundering risk 

  

the fcpa prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official or employee to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage outside of the united states we may interact with government officials in several different capacities as regulators of our insurance business as clients or partners who are stateowned or partially stateowned as health care providers who are employed by the government as hospitals that are stateowned and as officials issuing permits in connection with real estate transactions violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and doj have increased their enforcement activities with respect to fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 applies to all companies with a nexus to the united kingdom under this act any voluntary disclosures of fcpa violations may be shared with united kingdom authorities thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

as a large global health service company operating in a complex industry we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity results of operations financial condition or the trading price of our securities you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below together with other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance 

strategic and operational risks 

future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively 

the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors including our ability to 

• differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors 

• develop and introduce new and innovative products solutions or programs that focus on improving patient outcomes and assist in controlling costs or are in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumerdirected products 

• grow our product portfolio and identify and introduce the proper mix or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace 

• evaluate drugs for efficacy value and price to assist clients in selecting a costeffective formulary 

• offer costeffective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services 

• access or continue accessing key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories in our specialty business 

• leverage purchase volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers 

• attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees 

• attract develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners 

• attract new and maintain existing customer and client relationships 

• transition health care providers from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased system 

• improve medical cost competitiveness in our targeted markets 

• manage our medical pharmacy administrative and other operating costs effectively and 

• contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacy providers on favorable terms 

for our strategic initiatives to succeed we must effectively integrate our operations including with express scripts and other acquired businesses actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization and promote a global mindset along with a focus on individual customers and clients if we fail to do so our business may be unable to grow as planned or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory we will be unable to rapidly respond to competitive economic and regulatory changes if we do not make important strategic and operational decisions quickly define our appetite for risk implement new governance managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly if these initiatives fail or are not executed effectively our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected 

  

we operate in a highly competitive evolving and rapidly changing industry and our failure to adapt could negatively impact our business 

the health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving any significant shifts in the structure of the industry could alter industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients and customers industry shifts could result and have resulted from among other things 

• a large intra or interindustry merger or industry consolidation 

• strategic alliances 

• new or alternative business models 

• continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other health care providers as well as changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and health care providers 

• new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health service industry 

• the ability of larger employers and clients to contract directly with providers 

• technological changes and rapid shifts in the use of technology such as telemedicine 

• the impact or consequences of legislation or regulatory changes 

• changes in the united states postal service or the consolidation of shipping carriers 

• increased drug acquisition cost or unexpected changes to drug pricing trend 

• change in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market 

• a change in drug utilization or 

• a change in utilization under riskbased contracts in the health benefit management market 

our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our failure to compete effectively to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and maintain or increase market share could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer and client needs legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors in particular markets our competitors may have greater better or more established capabilities resources market share reputation or business relationships or lower profit margin or financial return expectations our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between our competitors and us our express scripts client contracts generally have threeyear terms as described in greater detail in the description of our business in item 1 of this form 10k one of our key clients in the health services segment is the united states department of defense if one or more of our large clients terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason including as a result of being acquired or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in decreases in the trading price of our securities or other adverse effects 

our success depends in part on our ability to compete effectively in our markets set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share increase customers as planned differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that provide enhanced value to our customers provide quality and satisfactory levels of service and retain accounts with favorable medical cost experience or more profitable products versus retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience or less profitable products 

we must remain competitive to attract new customers retain existing customers and further integrate additional product and service offerings to succeed in this highly competitive marketplace it is imperative that we maintain a strong reputation the negative 

reputational impact of a significant event including a failure to execute on customer or client contracts or strategic or operational initiatives failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our customers could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable arrangements which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we face price competition and other pressures that could compress our margins or result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of services delivered to our customers 

while we compete on the basis of many service and qualityrelated factors we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition our client contracts are subject to negotiation as clients seek to contain their costs including by reducing benefits offered increasingly our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met clients can easily move between our competitors and us our clients are well informed and typically have knowledgeable consultants that seek competing bids from our competitors before contract renewal in addition as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams they look to take on services that we typically provide each of these events could negatively impact our financial results 

further federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates fiscal or other concerns related to the governmentsponsored programs in which we participate such as medicare may cause decreasing reimbursement rates delays in premium payments restrictions on implementing changes in premium rates or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of customers or clients resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

premiums in the integrated medical segment are generally set for oneyear periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences or renews our revenue on individual and family plans “ifp” and medicare policies is based on bids submitted midyear in the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our ifp and medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period actual costs may exceed what we estimate in setting premiums our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control as well as changes in customers’ health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices our profitability depends in part on our ability to accurately predict price for and effectively manage future health care costs relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results 

strong competition within the pharmacy benefit business has also generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings these competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many companies including us to reduce the prices charged for products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the formulary fees and related rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers our inability to maintain positive trends or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited 

we maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including historical claim experience but this estimation process requires extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns or procedures changes in customer base and product mix changes in the utilization of prescription drugs medical or other covered items or services changes in medical cost trends changes in our health management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited additionally we must estimate the amount of rebates payable by us under the aca’s and cms’s minimum loss ratio rules and the amounts payable by us to and receivable by us from the united states federal government under the aca’s remaining premium stabilization program because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing reserves 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health service providers and with producers and consultants our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we contract with or employ physicians hospitals and other health service providers and facilities to provide health services to our customers our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices in any particular market physicians hospitals and health service providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products or services for our customers in some markets certain providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations and multispecialty physician groups may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us if providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially adversely affected establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups specialist groups independent practice associations hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased health care system if such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected 

our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers may also be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us such as changes in medicare or medicaid reimbursement levels increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals physician groups and providers continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other providers the emergence of accountable care organizations vertical integration of providers and other entities changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and providers and new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health care industry may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate in some instances these organizations may compete directly with us potentially affecting the way we price our products and services or causing us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive 

outofnetwork providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill while benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement and state regulations seek to establish methodologies and dispute resolution processes outofnetwork providers are increasingly sophisticated and aggressive as a result the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

additionally certain of our products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we compete our sales could be materially adversely affected if we were are unable to attract retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 

if we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with among other things 

• discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies 

• discounts in the form of rebates for drug utilization 

• fees for administering rebate programs including invoicing allocating and collecting rebates 

• fees for services provided to pharmaceutical manufacturers by our specialty pharmacies and 

• access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals by our specialty pharmacies 

our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers are typically nonexclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party the consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums adoption of new laws rules or regulations or changes in or new interpretations of existing laws rules or regulations relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers our business and financial results could be impaired 

more than 67700 retail pharmacies which represent over 99 of all united states retail pharmacies participated in one or more of our networks as of december 31 2019 the ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 65 of the total number of stores in our largest network in certain geographic areas of the united states our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains contracts with retail pharmacies are generally nonexclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party if one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us or is able to renegotiate terms substantially less favorable to us our customers’ access to retail pharmacies or our business could be materially adversely affected the entry of one or more additional large pharmacy chains into the pharmacy benefit management business the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could have a negative impact on our claims volume or our competitiveness in the marketplace which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations 

changes in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy clients generally use pricing metrics published by third parties as benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs if these benchmarks are no longer published by third parties we or our contractual partners adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry legislation or regulation requires the use of other pricing benchmarks or future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations the short or longterm impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a global company we face political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations or our longterm growth 

as a global company our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks can vary substantially by market and include political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks including government intervention that we do not face in our us operations the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including but not limited to those arising from 

• geopolitical business conditions and demands including the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union 

• regulation that may discriminate against us companies favor nationalization or expropriate assets 

• price controls or other pricing issues and exchange controls restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds out of the countries in which we operate foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations and restrictions on converting currencies from foreign operations into other currencies uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of tax positions 

• reliance on local employees and interpretations of labor laws in foreign jurisdictions 

• managing our partner relationships in countries outside of the united states 

• providing data protection on a global basis and sufficient levels of technical support in different locations 

• the global trend for companies to enact local data residency requirements 

• acts of civil unrest war terrorism natural disasters or pandemics such as the recent coronavirus outbreak in locations where we operate and 

• general economic and political conditions 

these factors may increase in significance as we continue to expand globally and operating in new foreign markets may require considerable management time before operations generate any significant revenues and earnings any one of these challenges could negatively affect our operations or longterm growth for example due to the concentration of our international business in south korea the international markets segment is exposed to potential losses resulting from economic and regulatory changes in that 

country and the geopolitical climate in the korean peninsula as well as foreign currency movements affecting the south korean currency that could have a significant impact on the segment’s results and our consolidated financial results 

international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with us and foreign laws prohibiting bribery corruption and money laundering in addition to other regulations regarding among other things our products directtoconsumer communications customer privacy data protection and data residency violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and longterm growth 

strategic transactions including our acquisition of express scripts involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges 

as part of our strategy we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures licensing arrangements divestitures and other relationships collectively referred to as “strategic transactions” there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities and we may be unable to identify and successfully complete strategic transactions in the future in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives and we may divest or wind down such businesses we may be unable to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us within the expected timeframes or at all we may have continued financial exposure to divested businesses following the completion of any such transaction including increased costs due to potential litigation contingent liabilities and indemnification of the buyer related to among other things lawsuits regulatory matters or tax liabilities 

our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate or separate operations resources and systems including data security systems in an efficient and effective manner for example the continued success of the express scripts acquisition will depend in part on our ability to continue to successfully combine the businesses of cigna and express scripts and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination 

key risks of the express scripts integration include but are not limited to retaining existing clients and attracting new clients on profitable terms maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and realizing operational synergies integrating information technology communications programs financial procedures and operations and other systems procedures and policies coordinating geographically separate organizations and ongoing modifications to internal financial control standards 

integration and separation activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits including with respect to the express scripts integration may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected these activities are complex costly and timeconsuming and may divert management’s attention from ongoing business concerns delays or issues encountered in these activities could have a material adverse effect on the revenues expenses operating results and financial condition of the combined company 

strategic transactions could result in increased costs including facilities and systems consolidation costs and costs to retain key employees decreases in expected revenues earnings or cash flows and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of express scripts’ businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of those businesses should allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all as of december 31 2019 our goodwill and other intangible assets had a carrying value of approximately 81 billion representing 52 of our total consolidated assets the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if the businesses we acquire do not perform in a manner consistent with our assumptions future evaluations requiring an impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs a material decrease in shareholders’ equity could negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants in addition the trading price of our securities may decline if among other things we are unable to achieve our estimates of earnings growth and operational cost savings or the transaction costs related to the acquisition and integration are greater than expected the trading price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts 

additionally joint ventures and equity investments present risks that are different from acquisitions including risks related to specific operations and finances of the businesses we invest in selection of appropriate parties differing objectives of the various 

parties competition between and among parties compliance activities including compliance with applicable cms requirements growing the business in a manner acceptable to all the parties maintaining positive relationships among the parties clients and customers initial and ongoing governance of joint ventures and customer and business disruption that may occur upon a joint venture termination 

further we may finance strategic transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders or by incurring additional debt that could increase costs and impact our ability to access capital in the future 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud the integration of businesses is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations we also rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of joint venture entities and other entities in which we invest and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information that could negatively impact the trading price of our securities and our access to capital 

we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions 

to improve operating costs productivity and efficiencies we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services our operations may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations to us if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a contractual dispute between us and the third party even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections we have limited control over the actions of third parties for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations any security breach involving one of our thirdparty vendors or a dispute between us and a thirdparty vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations adopt new processes for managing these service providers or redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our thirdparty vendors do not perform as expected we may not realize or not realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships this could result in additional costs or regulatory compliance issues or create other operational or financial problems for us terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach termination or transition in services we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and in turn our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

a significant disruption in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as claims processing and payment internet support and customer call centers data centers and corporate facilities processing new and renewal business maintaining appropriate shipment and storage conditions for prescriptions such as temperature and protection from contamination and home delivery processing in some instances our ability to provide services or products including processing and dispensing prescriptions depends on the availability of services and products provided by suppliers pharmaceutical manufacturers vendors or shipping carriers a disruption in our supply chain including as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak or inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business additionally any failure or disruption of our performance of or our ability to perform key business functions including through unavailability or cyberattack of our information technology systems or those of third parties could cause slower response times decreased levels of service satisfaction and harm to our reputation our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems and we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations 

our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care providers and to operate our business if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error or if we or any of the thirdparty service providers we engage were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients customers and health care providers and hinder our ability to provide services and products establish appropriate pricing for products and services retain and attract clients and customers establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance among other things 

our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success we must continue to invest in longterm solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations enhance the customer experience act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats our success is dependent in large part on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a costefficient and resourceefficient manner increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important we must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner further because system development projects are long term in nature they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion our failure to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

as a large health service company we are subject to cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks we may suffer exposure to substantial liability reputational harm loss of revenue or other damages 

our business depends on our clients’ and customers’ willingness to entrust us with their healthrelated and other sensitive personal information computer systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses or malware programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems we have been and will likely continue to be the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access cyberattacks or other computerrelated penetrations there have been and will likely continue to be large scale cyberattacks within the health service industry additionally hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information technology human or technological error has and could in the future result in for example unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of company customer or other thirdparty data or systems theft of sensitive regulated or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware destructive attacks or other means and business delays service or system disruptions or denials of service 

as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally our exposure to unintended disclosures data security and related cybersecurity risks increases including the risk of undetected attacks damage loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases if disruptions disclosures or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded we have implemented security technologies processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks however there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches 

cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our proprietary systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties such as external service providers and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers in addition while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services our vendors and in turn their own service providers may become subject to the same types of security breaches finally our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft misplaced or lost data human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers’ and clients’ data 

the costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers 

in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers or other third parties could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy could also negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives such events could cause us to breach our contractual confidentiality obligations and violate applicable laws these events would negatively affect our ability to compete others’ trust in us our reputation customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure requirements litigation and other enforcement proceedings material fines penalties or remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders and other adverse actions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

in managing medical practices and operating pharmacies onsite clinics and other types of medical facilities we may be subject to additional liability that could result in significant time and expense 

in addition to contracting with physicians and other health care providers for services we employ physicians pharmacists nurses and other health care providers at our home delivery and specialty pharmacies onsite low acuity and primary care practices and infusion clinics that we manage and operate for our customers as well as certain clinics for our employees we also provide inhome care through health care providers that we employ as well as through thirdparty contractors as such we may be subject to liability for certain acts omissions or injuries caused by our employees or agents or occurring at one of these practices pharmacies or clinics the defense of any actions may result in significant expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

legal and compliance risks 

our business is subject to substantial government regulation as well as new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our business is regulated at the federal state local and international levels the laws and rules governing our business and related interpretations are increasing in number and complexity are subject to frequent change and can be inconsistent or in conflict with each other noncompliance with applicable regulations by us or our thirdparty vendors could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

we must identify assess and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment as well as comply with the various existing regulations applicable to our business there are currently pending and in the future there will likely be legislative or regulatory proposals which seek to manage the health care industry including managing prescription drug costs and health records as well as regulating drug distribution we expect federal and state governments to continue to enact and seriously consider many broadbased legislative and regulatory proposals that will or could materially impact various aspects of the health care and related benefits system the trading price of our securities may react to the announcement of such proposals we are unable to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted or the specific terms thereof including their effect on our operations however certain of these proposals could if enacted adversely impact our business and results of operations 

existing or future laws rules regulatory interpretations or judgments could force us to change how we conduct our business affect the products and services we offer restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our costs including operating health care technology and administrative costs and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment for example a decision invalidating the aca or portions thereof could result in material changes to the way we conduct our business as well as the loss of subsidies related to our ifp offerings we are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to among other things market many of our products expand into additional geographic or product markets increase prices for certain regulated products and consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs existing or future laws and rules could also require or lead us to take other actions such as changing our business practices and could increase our liability 

further failure to effectively implement or adjust our strategic and operational initiatives such as by reducing operating costs adjusting premium pricing or benefit design or transforming our business model in response to regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows including but not limited to our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets 

for more information on regulations affecting our business see “business – regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

there are various risks associated with participating in governmentsponsored programs such as medicare including dependence upon government funding compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight and enforcement 

through our government business we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans additionally our health services business provides services to government entities and payers participating in government health care programs 

our revenues from government funded programs including our medicare programs and our government clients are dependent in whole or in part upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state or local governments funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available unanticipated changes in funding such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments or the failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability 

the medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans are established by contract although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors some of which are outside our control for example a portion of each medicare advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s star rating with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for qualitybased bonus payments a plan’s star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform well are able to offer enhanced benefits market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater our medicare advantage plans’ and medicare part d plans’ operating results premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership or impact our financial performance see part ii item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of information – industry developments and other matters affecting our health services and integrated medical segments for additional information on our star ratings 

additionally if we fail to comply with cms’s contractual requirements including data submission enrollment and marketing provider network adequacy provider directory accuracy quality measures claims payment continuity of care and call center performance we may be subject to administrative actions including enrollment sanctions or contract termination fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability as described under “business – regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule that would revise its radv methodology by among other things excluding an adjustment for underlying feeforservice data errors and extrapolating radv results at the contract level for radv audits of contract year 2011 and all subsequent years if adopted in its current form the rule could result in some combination of degraded plan benefits higher monthly premiums or reduced choice for the population served by all medicare advantage insurers the company along with other medicare advantage organizations and additional interested parties submitted comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process the comment period concluded on august 28 2019 while it is uncertain that cms will finalize the rule as proposed if adopted it could have a material impact on the company’s future results of operations 

our participation in health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers through our ifp offerings involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows the executive order signed in october 2017 that halted payment of the costsharing reduction subsidies under the aca has created additional uncertainty regarding the future of public health insurance exchanges 

any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs could result in investigations or litigation such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws this could subject us to damage awards including treble damages fines penalties or other enforcement actions restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers limits on expansion restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies which could adversely impact our business cash flows financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we face risks related to litigation regulatory audits and investigations 

we are routinely involved in numerous claims lawsuits regulatory audits investigations and other legal matters arising for the most part in the ordinary course of business these legal matters could include benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims claims arising from consumer protection laws false claims act laws claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements employment and employment discriminationrelated suits antitrust claims employee benefit claims wage and hour claims tax privacy intellectual property and whistleblower claims shareholder suits and other securities law claims real estate disputes claims related to disclosure of certain business practices and claims arising from customer audits and contract performance including government contracts in addition we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business such as marketing misconduct failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care provider network structure poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions erisa claims allegations related to calculations of cost sharing and claims related to our administration of selffunded business we are also routinely involved in legal matters arising from our health services business including without limitation claims related to the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our home delivery and specialty pharmacies pharmacy benefit management services such as formulary management services health benefit management services and provider services there are currently and may be in the future attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and other companies in our industry individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry 

court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages may be sought we seek to procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities however certain potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded in addition certain types of damages such as punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future resolving disputes is often expensive and disruptive regardless of the outcome additionally it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices losses material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation 

we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare and pharmacy departments attorneys general cms dol and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions with respect to our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plans compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments certain of our contracts are currently subject to radv audits by cms and the oig the doj is conducting an industrywide investigation of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes including review of medical charts of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health service disability and life insurance industries including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices and increased scrutiny by other federal and state governmental agencies such as state attorneys general empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings 

in addition various government agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pharmacy benefit management practices many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other companies agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements we cannot predict what effect if any such government investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the industry in general however we will likely continue to experience government scrutiny and audit activity which has and may in the future result in civil penalties 

regulatory audits investigations or reviews or actions by other government agencies could result in changes to our business practices retroactive adjustments to certain premiums significant fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including corporate integrity agreements restrictions on our ability to participate in government programs market certain products or engage in businessrelated activities that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity in addition disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

a description of material pending legal actions and other legal and regulatory matters is included in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k the outcome of litigation and other legal or regulatory matters is always uncertain 

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected 

most of our activities involve the receipt use storage or transmission of a substantial amount of individuals’ protected health information and personally identifiable information we also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes and in some cases provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators and analysts the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients in some cases such laws rules regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements we are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information such as the gdpr can be more stringent than in the united states and they vary across jurisdictions in addition more jurisdictions are regulating the transfer of data across borders and domestic privacy and data protection laws are generally becoming more onerous 

these laws rules and contractual requirements are subject to change and the regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding compliance with new privacy security and data laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for more information on privacy regulations to which we are subject see “business – regulation” in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

hipaa requires covered entities to comply with the hipaa privacy security and breach rules in addition business associates must comply with the hipaa security and breach requirements while we endeavor to provide appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has continued its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and has expanded it to include business associates in addition hhs continues to exercise its enforcement authority such as enforcement actions resulting from investigations brought on by notification to hhs of a breach an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows and reputation 

noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our thirdparty service providers could materially adversely affect our business and reputation including our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

effective prevention detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change in addition ongoing vigorous law enforcement a highly technical regulatory scheme and the doddfrank act and related regulations enhance regulators’ enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources failure of our prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings fines and penalties 

in addition provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our selfinsured clients further during an economic downturn we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation 

economic risks 

economic and market conditions affect the value of our financial instruments and the value of particular assets and liabilities 

as an insurer we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities the market value of our investments vary depending on economic and market conditions for example generally low levels of interest rates on 

investments such as those experienced in us and foreign financial markets during recent years have negatively impacted our level of investment income earned in recent periods 

a substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interestyielding debt securities of varying maturities fixed redeemable preferred securities and commercial mortgage loans the value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio and increase interest expense if we were to access our available lines of credit in addition a delay in payment of principal or interest by issuers or defaults by issuers could reduce our investment income and require us to write down the value of our investments 

significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses 

we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans a significant decline in the value of the plans’ equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding this could reduce the cash available to us including our subsidiaries we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension obligations sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plans 

a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital 

financial strength claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future a downgrade of any of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth within our insurance subsidiaries 

global market economic and geopolitical conditions may cause fluctuations in equity market prices interest rates and credit spreads that could impact our ability to raise or deploy capital and affect our overall liquidity 

if the equity and credit markets experience extreme volatility and disruption there could be downward pressure on stock prices and restricted access to capital for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength extreme disruption in the credit markets could adversely impact our access to and cost of capital in the future 

in the event of adverse economic and industry conditions we may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the funds we have available for other purposes such as investments and other expenditures in ongoing businesses acquisitions dividends and stock repurchases in these circumstances our ability to execute our strategy may be limited our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and market conditions may be reduced or our access to capital markets may be limited such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms 

in connection with the combination with express scripts we have considerably higher levels of indebtedness than cigna and express scripts previously carried which will result in higher relative debt service costs and less cash flow from operations available to fund growth stock repurchases and other corporate purposes 

the longterm indebtedness of cigna was approximately 319 billion as of december 31 2019 this level of indebtedness 

• requires us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to debt payments thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies make stock repurchases pay dividends and for general corporate purposes 

• increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions including increases in interest rates for our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates and are in a greater amount than floating rate assets held or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher and 

• limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry 

the covenants to which we have agreed in connection with the financing and our indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio in comparison with that of cigna or express scripts on a recent historical basis may have the effect among other things of restricting our financial and operating flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions creating competitive disadvantages compared with other competitors with lower debt levels during the deleveraging process if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to seek additional dividends from our subsidiaries sell assets seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt 

unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

many factors including geopolitical issues future economic downturns availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the us and global economies our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers both employers and individuals health care providers pharmacy manufacturers pharmacy providers and thirdparty vendors for example 

• employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us 

• higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employerbased plans including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employerbased plans or our individual plans 

• because of unfavorable economic conditions or the aca employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 

• our historical disability claim experience and industry data indicate that submitted disability claims rise under adverse economic conditions 

• if clients are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us 

• our clients or potential clients may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 

• our clients may be acquired consolidated or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business or workforce which could reduce the number of customers we serve or otherwise result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services 

• a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers potentially increasing our medical costs as these providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own economic challenges 

• our thirdparty vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion 

these factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base revenues or margins or an increase in our operating costs 

in addition during and following a prolonged unfavorable economic environment federal and state budgets could be materially adversely affected resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in federal and state government programs such as medicare and social security or under contracts with government entities these federal and state budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers 

we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies primarily to limit losses from large exposures or to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses we also may enter into reinsurance arrangements in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold 

under all reinsurance arrangements reinsurers assume insured losses subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit these arrangements also subject us to various obligations representations and warranties with the reinsurers reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies reinsurers may become financially unsound if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies 

the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

   

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition as of december 31 2019 compared with december 31 2018 and our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with 2018 and 2017 we encourage you to read this mda in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k “form 10k” and the risk factors contained in part 1a of this form 10k for comparisons of our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 with 2017 please refer to the previously filed mda included in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 

  

unless otherwise indicated financial information in the mda is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional information regarding the company’s significant accounting policies in some of our financial tables in this mda we present either percentage changes or “nm” when those changes are so large as to become not meaningful changes in percentages are expressed in basis points “bps” 

  

in this mda our consolidated measures “adjusted income from operations” earnings per share on that same basis and “adjusted revenues” are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable gaap measures of “shareholders’ net income” “earnings per share” and “total revenues” we also use pretax adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues to measure the results of our segments 

  

we use adjusted income from operations as our principal financial measure of operating performance because management believes it best reflects the underlying results of our business operations and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue expenses and profitability we define adjusted income from operations as shareholders’ net income or income before taxes for the segment metric excluding realized investment gains and losses amortization of acquired intangible assets results of anthem and coventry health care inc “coventry” collectively the “transitioning clients” see the “key transactions and developments” section of the mda for further discussion of transitioning clients and special items cigna’s share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded income or expense amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of underlying performance or the responsibility of operating segment management include 

  

 realized investment gains losses including changes in market values of certain financial instruments between balance sheet dates as well as gains and losses associated with invested asset sales 

 amortization of acquired intangible assets because these relate to costs incurred for acquisitions 

 results of transitioning clients because those results are not indicative of ongoing results  

 special items if any that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to the nature or size of these matters see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of special items 

  

the term “adjusted revenues” is defined as total revenues excluding the following adjustments revenue contributions from transitioning clients special items and cigna’s share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the international markets segment using the equity method of accounting we exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business

cigna corporation together with its subsidiaries either individually or collectively referred to as “cigna” the “company” “we” “our” or “us” is a global health service organization dedicated to a mission of helping those we serve improve their health wellbeing and peace of mind our evolved strategy in support of our mission is go deeper go local go beyond using a differentiated set of pharmacy medical dental disability life and accident insurance and related products and services offered by our subsidiaries for further information on our business and strategy see item 1 “business” in this form 10k  

  

results for the year ended december 31 2019 included the results of express scripts’ business whereas results for 2018 only reflected express scripts’ results for the period following the acquisition on december 20 2018 and were not included in 2017 as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements effective in the first quarter of 2019 compensation cost for stock options is now recorded by our segments prior year segment information has not been restated for this change 

  

financial summary 

  

summarized below are certain key measures of our performance for the years ended december 31 

  



consolidated results of operations gaap basis 

  

   



commentary 2019 versus 2018 

  

unless indicated otherwise the commentary presented below and in the segment discussions that follow compare results for the year ended december 31 2019 with results for the year ended december 31 2018 

  

earnings and revenue 

  

shareholders’ net income increased primarily driven by the earnings contribution from express scripts and improved results in the integrated medical segment partially offset by interest expense on debt issued to finance the express scripts acquisition earnings per share also increased but at a significantly lower rate reflecting dilution from the shares issued in connection with the express scripts acquisition 

  

adjusted income from operations increased primarily driven by earnings from express scripts’ pharmacy benefits and health management businesses reported in the health services segment and improved results in integrated medical these favorable results were partially offset by higher interest expense reported in corporate from both debt issued to finance the acquisition and debt assumed from express scripts adjusted income from operations per share also increased but at a significantly lower rate reflecting dilution from the shares issued to acquire express scripts 

  

medical customers increased primarily attributable to growth in the select and middle market segments partially offset by a decline in the national accounts and individual market segments 

  

revenue growth primarily reflected the addition of express scripts and to a lesser extent business growth in the integrated medical segment detailed revenue items are discussed further below 

  

o pharmacy revenues in 2019 reflected the express scripts pharmacy benefit management business in 2018 we reported pharmacy revenues from express scripts for the period following the acquisition on december 20 2018 see the health services segment section of this mda for further discussion of pharmacy revenues 

o premiums increased primarily resulting from 1 customer growth across all segments predominantly integrated medical 2 rate increases in integrated medical reflecting underlying medical cost trends and 3 the addition of express scripts’ medicare part d business 

o fees and other revenues increased primarily driven by contributions from express scripts’ health management business reported in the health services segment higher fees in our integrated medical segment primarily driven by growth in our specialty businesses also contributed to the increase 

o net investment income decreased primarily reflecting the absence of investment income earned in the fourth quarter of 2018 on debt proceeds used to acquire express scripts in december 2018 

  

other components of consolidated results of operations 

  

 pharmacy and other service costs in 2019 this amount was primarily comprised of the express scripts’ pharmacy benefits and health management businesses reported in the health services segment in 2018 we reported activity from express scripts for the period following the acquisition on december 20 2018  

  

 medical costs and other benefit expenses increased primarily due to medical cost inflation in integrated medical customer growth in the insured business and the addition of express scripts’ medicare part d business  

  

 selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the addition of express scripts and to a lesser extent volumerelated expenses in integrated medical these increases were partially offset by suspension of the health insurance industry tax in 2019 

  

 amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2019 primarily reflected the impact of the express scripts acquisition 

  

 interest expense and other increased significantly primarily due to interest incurred on debt issued in the third quarter of 2018 to finance the express scripts acquisition and interest incurred on express scripts’ debt assumed upon closing of the acquisition 

  

 realized investment gains losses we reported realized investment gains in 2019 compared with losses in 2018 the improvement primarily resulted from gains on sales of real estate joint ventures higher gains on sales of debt securities and favorable market value adjustments on equity securities 

  

 the consolidated effective tax rate declined primarily due to suspension of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax in 2019 and recognition of incremental state tax benefits in the second quarter of 2019 

  

key transactions and business developments 

  

merger with express scripts 

  

as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements cigna acquired express scripts on december 20 2018 in a cash and stock transaction valued at 528 billion the “liquidity” section of this mda provides further discussion of the impact of the acquisition on our liquidity and capital resources 

  

we continue to incur costs related to this transaction including costs to integrate the cigna and express scripts operations these costs are being reported in “integration and transactionrelated costs” as a special item and excluded from adjusted income from operations because they are not indicative of future underlying performance of the business 

  

on january 30 2019 anthem exercised its early termination right and terminated their pharmacy benefit management services agreement with us effective march 1 2019 there is a twelvemonth transition period ending march 1 2020 the transition of anthem’s customers occurred at various dates as informed by anthem’s technology platform migration schedule in 2019 and 2018 we excluded the results of express scripts’ contract with anthem and also coventry from our nongaap reporting metrics “adjusted revenues” and “adjusted income from operations” and referred to these clients as “transitioning clients” as of december 31 2019 the transition of customers was substantially complete therefore beginning in 2020 we will no longer exclude results of transitioning clients from our reported adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations 

  

agreement to sell group disability and life business 

  

as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in december 2019 cigna entered into a definitive agreement to sell the group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for 63 billion the “liquidity” section of this mda provides further discussion of the impact of the pending divestiture on our liquidity and capital resources 

  

organizational efficiency plan 

  

as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company committed to a plan to increase our organizational alignment and operational efficiency and reduce costs as a result we recognized a charge in selling general and administrative expenses of 207 million pretax 162 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2019 we expect to realize annualized aftertax savings of approximately 180 million a substantial portion of the savings is expected to be realized in 2020 

  

industry developments and other matters 

  

the “business  regulation” section of this form 10k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act “aca” provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our health care and pharmacy services businesses including regulations issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” and the departments of the treasury and health and human services “hhs” the health care and pharmacy services businesses continue to operate in a dynamic environment and the laws and regulations applicable to these businesses including the aca continue to be subject to legislative regulatory and judicial challenges the table presented below provides an update on the expected impact of these items and other matters as of december 31 2019 

  

   

  

  

   

risk mitigation programs – individual aca business 

  

in 2016 we recorded an allowance for the entire balance of our aca risk corridor receivable based on court decisions and the large program deficit during 2018 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled that health insurers are not entitled to receive amounts due under the risk corridor program that have been withheld by congress the plaintiffs petitioned the us supreme court to review this unfavorable decision during the second quarter of 2019 the us supreme court agreed to review the unfavorable lower court rulings in the risk corridor cases and heard oral arguments on december 10 2019 we now await a decision which is expected by june 2020 we continue to carry an allowance for the balance of our aca risk corridor receivables of 109 million no other significant updates occurred in 2019 related to the risk corridor legal matters 

  

risk adjustment balances are subject to audit adjustment by cms following each program year in april 2019 cms published the final notice of benefit and payment parameters for the 2020 plan year that clarified the 2017 benefit year radv program cms released the 2017 benefit year data validation error rates in may and published the preliminary radv transfers in august 2019 based on the information currently available we adjusted our risk adjustment balance to reflect the expected outcome of the radv program 

  

the following table presents our balances associated with the risk adjustment program as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 inclusive of the radv adjustments recorded in 2019 

   

charges for the ongoing risk adjustment program and radv audit adjustments were 162 million pretax 126 million aftertax in 2019 147 million pretax 116 million aftertax in 2018 and 162 million 105 million aftertax in 2017 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

   

liquidity 

  

we maintain liquidity at two levels the subsidiary level and the parent company level 

  

liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of 

  

· medical costs pharmacy and other benefit payments 

· expense requirements primarily for employee compensation and benefits information technology and facilities costs 

 income taxes and 

 debt service 

  

our subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by 

  

· maintaining appropriate levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

· using cash flows from operating activities 

 matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities 

 selling investments and 

 borrowing from affiliates subject to applicable regulatory limits 

  

liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of 

  

· debt service and dividend payments to shareholders 

· lending to subsidiaries as needed and 

 pension plan funding 

  

the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by 

  

· maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments 

· collecting dividends from its subsidiaries 

· using proceeds from issuance of debt and common stock and 

 borrowing from its subsidiaries subject to applicable regulatory limits 

  

dividends from our insurance health maintenance organization “hmo” and foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these restrictions most of express scripts’ subsidiaries provide significant financial flexibility to cigna because they are not subject to regulatory restrictions on paying dividends 

  

cash flows for the years ended december 31 were as follows 

  

   

the following discussion explains variances in the various categories of cash flows in 2019 compared with 2018 

  

operating activities 

  

cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for pharmacy revenues and costs premiums fees investment income taxes benefit costs and other expenses 

  

cash flows from operating activities increased primarily driven by higher net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the settlement timing of payables and accrued liabilities these increases were partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable collections 

  

investing and financing activities 

  

our most significant investing and financing activities in 2018 related to acquiring express scripts see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition cigna financed a portion of the acquisition in cash primarily with debt financing as shown above and described more fully in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements with the remaining required cash coming from cash on hand in 2018 cigna also acquired onepath life for approximately 480 million largely with cash held in our foreign operations 

  

cash used for investing activities decreased primarily due to the absence of cash paid to acquire express scripts in 2018 and lower net investment purchases partially offset by higher property and equipment purchases 

  

cash used for financing activities increased primarily due to the absence of the express scripts acquisition debt financing activities in 2018 higher repayments of longterm debt and share repurchases 

  

we maintain a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors under this program we may repurchase shares from time to time depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and alternate uses of capital the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with rule 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including through rule 10b51 trading plans the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

  

in 2019 we repurchased 118 million shares for approximately 20 billion from january 1 2020 through february 26 2020 we repurchased 20 million shares for approximately 425 million share repurchase authority was 35 billion as of february 26 2020 

  

capital resources 

  

our capital resources primarily cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities provide protection for policyholders furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 

  

our acquisition of express scripts increased our debt and shareholders’ equity in 2018 as follows 

  

 stock express scripts’ shareholders received 02434 of a share of common stock of cigna for every one share of express scripts’ common stock cigna issued 1376 million additional shares to express scripts’ shareholders 

 debt see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the debt issued to finance the acquisition 

 assumption of express scripts’ senior notes see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the notes assumed in the acquisition of express scripts 

  

at december 31 2019 our debttocapitalization ratio was 452 a decline from 509 at december 31 2018 we have a nearterm focus on accelerated debt repayment and expect to continue to deleverage into the upper 30s by the end of 2020 using cash flows from operating activities 

  

in december 2019 cigna entered into a definitive agreement to sell the group disability and life business to new york life insurance company for 63 b illion the sale is expected to close by the third quarter of 2020 subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions cigna estimates to receive approximately 53 billion of net aftertax proceeds from this transaction and expects to use these proceeds for share repurchase and repayment of debt in 2020 

  

in 2018 cigna entered into a new revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement in financing the express scripts acquisition cigna had 10 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of december 31 2019 in 2019 cigna entered into an additional 364day revolving credit agreement that matures in october 2020 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revolving credit agreements 

  

management guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain management allocates resources to new longterm business commitments when returns considering the risks look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate 

  

we prioritize our use of capital resources to 

  

 provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to fund pension obligations 

 consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous and 

 return capital to investors primarily through share repurchases 

  

our capital management strategy to support the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations and certain international growth initiatives is to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings generated by our foreign operations this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states 

  

liquidity and capital resources outlook 

  

we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs through our cash and cash equivalents balances cash flows from operations commercial paper program credit agreements and the issuance of longterm debt as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 5 billion in cash and shortterm investments approximately 11 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonregulated subsidiaries we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy a description of our outstanding debt can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

as of december 31 2019 our unfunded pension liability was 873 million reflecting an increase of  283 million from december 31 2018 primarily attributable to a decrease in discount rates of approximately 90 basis points and an update to mortality assumptions we currently expect 2020 and 2021 required contributions to be immaterial see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 

  

our cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the risk factors section in this form 10k though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could increase costs or affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above the parent company can borrow an additional 10 billion from its insurance subsidiaries without further state approval 

  

guarantees and contractual obligations 

  

we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business see the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this mda for additional background on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations are as follows as of december 31 2019 

   

on balance sheet  

  

 insurance liabilities excluded from the table above are 4 billion of insurance liabilities 3 billion in contractholder deposit funds 1 billion in future policy benefits associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses as well as the reinsured workers’ compensation personal accident and supplemental benefits businesses as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows excluding these amounts the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of 23 billion recorded on the balance sheet including 6 billion reported in liabilities held for sale because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting charges and fees the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above 

  

o contractholder deposit funds see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies 

  

o future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit “gmdb” reported in future policy benefits do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements 

  

 longterm debt includes scheduled interest payments and current maturities of longterm debt see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding longterm debt finance leases are included in longterm debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage servers and equipment see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding finance leases 

  

 operating leases see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

 other noncurrent liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit “gmib” contracts without considering any related reinsurance arrangements pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations supplemental and deferred compensation plans interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and reinsurance liabilities estimated payments of 91 million for deferred compensation nonqualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above we expect to make immaterial contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2020 and they are reflected in the above table we expect to make payments subsequent to 2020 for these obligations however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension obligations  

  

the table above excludes the liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of such future payments in the event we are unable to sustain all of our 1 billion of uncertain tax positions it could result in future tax payments of approximately 760 million see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on uncertain tax positions 

  

offbalance sheet  

  

 purchase obligations as of december 31 2019 purchase obligations consisted of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements for future services and investment commitments as follows 

  

 

  

our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements but do not anticipate doing so at this time purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased 

  

guarantees 

  

we are contingently liable for various financial and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

  

 it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and 

 changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below we regularly evaluate items that may impact critical accounting estimates 

  

in addition to the estimates presented in the following tables there are other accounting estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits as well as estimates with respect to pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions and certain compensation accruals 

  

management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience significantly differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition the tables below present the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations liquidity or financial condition except for assessing impairment of goodwill and debt securities carried at fair value below cost 

   



   



   

segment reporting 

  

the following section of this mda discusses the results of each of our segments see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our segments 

  

in segment discussions we present adjusted revenues and “pretax adjusted income from operations” defined as income before taxes excluding realized investment gains losses amortization of acquired intangible assets results of transitioning clients income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and special items ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as pretax adjusted income from operations see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to pretax adjusted income from operations as well as a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues note 23 to the consolidated financial statements also explains two additional items that are important in understanding our segment results 1 segment revenues include both external revenues and sales between segments that are eliminated in corporate and 2 beginning in the first quarter of 2019 compensation cost for stock options is recorded by the segments prior year segment information was not restated for this change in stock option reporting 

  

in these segment discussions we also present “pretax adjusted margin” defined as pretax adjusted income from operations divided by adjusted revenues 

  

see the mda executive overview for summarized financial results of each of our segments 

  

health services segment 

  

the health services segment includes pharmacy benefits management specialty pharmacy services clinical solutions home delivery and health management services this segment includes express scripts’ business from the december 20 2018 date of acquisition except for express scripts’ medicare part d business that is reported in the government operating segment of our integrated medical segment this segment also includes cigna’s legacy home delivery pharmacy business due to the timing of the acquisition results of operations in 2018 only included results from the express scripts’ business for the period following the acquisition on december 20 2018 the main driver of period over period increases in the financial information presented below was the results from the express scripts’ business in 2019 as described in the introduction to segment reporting performance of the health services segment is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations 

  

the key factors that impact health services revenues and costs of revenues are volume mix and price these key factors are discussed further below see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment 

  

 as our clients’ claim volumes increase or decrease our resulting revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly increase or decrease our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of changes in purchasing discounts 

  

 the mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling as our mix of drugs changes our resulting pharmacy revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly may increase or decrease the primary driver of fluctuations within our mix of claims is the generic fill rate generally higher generic fill rates reduce revenues as generic drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace however as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients higher generic fill rates generally have a favorable impact on our gross profit the home delivery generic fill rate is currently lower than the network generic fill rate as fewer generic substitutions are available among maintenance medications such as therapies for chronic conditions commonly dispensed from home delivery pharmacies as compared to acute medications that are primarily dispensed by pharmacies in our retail networks 

  

 our client contract pricing is impacted by our ability to negotiate supply chain contracts for pharmacy network pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates as we seek to improve the effectiveness of our integrated solutions for the benefit of our clients we are continuously innovating and optimizing the supply chain our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of supply chain initiatives implemented inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals therefore the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients can affect our revenues and cost of revenues 

  

in this mda we present revenues and gross profit “excluding transitioning clients” in addition to those metrics including transitioning clients pretax adjusted income from operations and pretax adjusted margin exclude contributions from transitioning 

clients see the “key transactions and business developments” section of this mda for further discussion of transitioning clients and why we present this information 

  

results of operations

pretax adjusted income from operations the increase reflected a full year of results from the express scripts’ business in 2019 results in the health services segment in 2019 reflected strong performance including customer growth adjusted pharmacy scripts volumes and benefits from the effective management of the supply chain 

integrated medical segment 

  

the business section of this form 10k see the “integrated medical” section describes the various products and funding solutions offered by this segment including the various revenue sources as described in the introduction to segment reporting performance of the integrated medical segment is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations key factors affecting profitability for this segment include

results of operations 

  

   

2019 versus 2018 

  

adjusted revenues the increase reflected commercial customer growth in our insured business as well as higher premium rates due to underlying medical cost trend and the addition of express scripts’ medicare part d business 

  

pretax adjusted income from operations the increase reflected strong ongoing performance in our commercial segment including increased contributions from our commercial health insurance business and specialty products partially offset by lower margins in our individual business 

  

medical care ratio as expected the medical care ratio increased reflecting a reduction in premiums from the pricing impact of the suspension of the health insurance industry tax in 2019 and business mix related to the addition of express scripts’ medicare part d business as well as a higher individual medical care ratio 

  

expense ratio the expense ratio decreased primarily reflecting higher revenues in our insurance business and the suspension of the health insurance industry tax in 2019 

  

other items affecting integrated medical results 

  

unpaid claims and claim expenses 

  

our unpaid claims and claim expenses liability was higher as of december 31 2019 compared with december 31 2018 primarily due to customer growth 

  

medical customers 

  

our medical customer base was higher at december 31 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 primarily reflecting growth in our select and middle market segments partially offset by a lower customer base in our national accounts and individual market segments 

  

a medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria 

  

 is covered under a medical insurance policy managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us 

 has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan or 

 has medical claims that are administered by us 

  

international markets segment 

  

as described in the introduction to segment reporting performance of the international markets segment is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations key factors affecting pretax adjusted income from operations for this segment are 

 premium growth including new business and customer retention 

 benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums loss ratio 

 selling general and administrative expense and acquisition expense as a percentage of revenues expense ratio and acquisition cost ratio and 

 the impact of foreign currency movements 

  

results of operations 



2019 versus 2018 

  

adjusted revenues the increase reflected business growth in asia europe and the middle east and the acquisition of onepath life in new zealand in the fourth quarter of 2018 these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements 

  

pretax adjusted income from operations the increase reflected business growth in asia and the acquisition of onepath life partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements 

  

the segment’s loss ratio was essentially flat 

  

the acquisition cost ratio decreased due to lower spending in certain markets and the acquisition of onepath life partially offset by higher acquisition expenses in south korea and taiwan 

  

the increase in the expense ratio excluding acquisition costs was driven primarily by strategic investments for longterm growth and integration of onepath life 

  

other items affecting international markets results 

  

south korea is the single largest geographic market for our international markets segment in 2019 south korea generated 37 of the segment’s adjusted revenues and 63 of the segment’s pretax adjusted income from operations 

  

group disability and other 

  

as described in the introduction of segment reporting performance of group disability and other is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations key factors affecting pretax adjusted income from operations are 

  

 premium growth including new business and customer retention 

 net investment income 

 benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums loss ratio and 

 selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues excluding net investment income expense ratio 

  

results of operations 

   

2019 versus 2018 

  

adjusted revenues the increase reflected business growth in the group disability life and voluntary businesses partially offset by the continued runoff of international business and lower investment income 

  

pretax adjusted income from operations and pretax adjusted margin t he decreases resulted from unfavorable disability claims experience 

  

corporate 

  

corporate reflects amounts not allocated to operating segments including net interest expense defined as interest on corporate debt less net investment income on investments not supporting segment and other operations certain litigation matters expense associated with our frozen pension plans charitable contributions severance certain overhead and project costs and intersegment eliminations for products and services sold between segments as discussed in the introduction to segment reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2019 compensation cost for stock options is now recorded by the segments prior year results for corporate were not restated to reflect this change 

  

   

2019 versus 2018 

  

pretax adjusted loss from operations the increase reflected higher interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter of 2018 to finance the express scripts acquisition and debt assumed from express scripts 

  

investment assets 

  

the following table presents our investment asset portfolio excluding separate account assets as of december 31 2019 and 2018 additional information regarding our investment assets is included in notes 11 12 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

   

debt securities 

  

investments in debt securities include publiclytraded and privatelyplaced bonds mortgage and other assetbacked securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on our balance sheet additional information regarding valuation methodologies key inputs and controls is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements more detailed information about debt securities by type of issuer and maturity dates is included in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the following table reflects our portfolio of debt securities by type of issuer as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the table below includes investments held for sale as of december 31 2019 

  

   

our debt securities portfolio increased during 2019 reflecting increased valuations due to decreases in market yields partially offset by net sales and maturities as of december 31 2019 212 billion or 90 of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade baa and above or equivalent and the remaining 25 billion were below investment grade the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the noninvestment grade spectrum these quality characteristics have not materially changed from the prior year and are consistent with our investment strategy investments in debt securities are diversified by issuer geography and industry as appropriate 

  

foreign government obligations are concentrated in asia primarily south korea consistent with our risk management practice and local regulatory requirements of our international business operations corporate debt securities include private placement assets of 75 billion these investments are generally less marketable than publiclytraded bonds however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publiclytraded bonds with comparable credit risk we perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions if warranted 

  

in addition to amounts classified as debt securities in our consolidated balance sheets we participate in an insurance joint venture in china with a 50 ownership interest this entity had an investment portfolio of approximately 81 billion supporting its business that is primarily invested in chinese corporate and government debt securities we account for this joint venture on the equity method of accounting and report it in other assets there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31 2019 

  

commercial mortgage loans 

  

our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans diversified by property type location and borrower loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 70 of the property’s value at origination of the loan property value debt service coverage quality building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans 

  

commercial real estate capital markets remain very active for wellleased quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage loan portfolio possess these characteristics 

  

as of december 31 2019 the 19 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 65 loans that are in good standing given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment generally ranging between 30 and 40 we remain confident that borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms 

  

other longterm investments 

  

other longterm investments of  24 billion as of december 31 2019 included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures these entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privatelyheld companies securities partnerships and equity real estate given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns to mitigate risk these investments are diversified across approximately 160 separate partnerships and approximately 80 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships also the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region no single partnership investment exceeded 5 of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio 

  

problem and potential problem investments 

  

“problem” bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms including concessions by us for modification of interest rate principal payment or maturity date “potential problem” bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current no payment is more than 59 days past due but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 

  

the amount of problem or potential problem investments as of december 31 2019 and 2018 was not material 

  

investment outlook 

  

public equity markets rallied during 2019 reflecting the continued strength of the us economy however concerns related to trade and tariffs continue to contribute to financial market volatility we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions and trends including uncertainty caused by the united kingdom’s process of exiting the european union and their potential impact on our investment portfolio we expect continued volatility in certain sectors such as retail energy and natural gas future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date these future conditions are not reasonably predictable however we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investmentspecific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

  

market risk 

  

financial instruments 

  

our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices consistent with disclosure requirements the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments 

  

 changes in the fair values of insurancerelated assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk 

 changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets and 

 changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill deferred policy acquisition costs taxes and various accrued liabilities because they are not financial instruments their primary risks are other than market risk 

  

excluding these items our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are 

  

 interestrate risk on fixedrate mediumterm instruments changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return 

 foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the south korean won chinese yuan renminbi new zealand dollar and taiwan dollar an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 

  

our management of market risks 

  

we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk 

  

 investmentliability matching we generally select investment assets with characteristics such as duration yield currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations shorterterm investments generally support shorterterm life and health liabilities mediumterm fixedrate investments support interestsensitive and health liabilities longerterm investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and longterm disability liabilities 

 use of local currencies for foreign operations  we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies this technique limits exchange rate risk to our net assets 

 use of derivatives we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our primary market risks see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments 

  

effect of market fluctuations 

  

assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and 10 strengthening in the us dollar to foreign currencies the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities would have been as follows as of december 31 

  

   

the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates primarily on debt securities and commercial mortgage loans was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models primarily duration modeling 

  

in the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the fair value of the company’s longterm debt would decrease approximately 25 billion at december 31 2019 and 24 billion at december 31 2018 changes in the fair value of our longterm debt do not impact our financial position or operating results see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company’s debt 

  

the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10 of the us dollar equivalent fair value our foreign operations hold investment assets such as debt securities cash and cash equivalents that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities

group disability 

• group longterm and shortterm disability insurance products generally provide a fixed level of income to replace a portion of wages lost due to disability as part of our group disability insurance products we also assist employees in returning to work and employers with  

back to contents 

part i item 1 business 

resources to manage the cost of employee disability we are an industry leader in helping employees return to work quickly enabling higher productivity and lower cost for employers and a better quality of life for employees while we offer this coverage in all three funding arrangements most of our coverages are guaranteed cost 

• leave administration solutions help customers effectively manage workforce absence and provide coverage for paid leave we integrate the administration of our disability insurance products with other disability benefit programs behavioral programs medical programs social security advocacy and administration of the federal family and medical leave act fmla state leave laws and other leaveofabsence programs we believe this integration supports greater efficiency and effectiveness in disability claims management enhances productivity and reduces overall costs to employers integration also provides early insight into employees at risk for future disability claims coordinating the administration of these disability programs with programs offered by our medical business provides enhanced opportunities to influence outcomes reduce the cost of both medical and disability events and improve the returntowork rate group life insurance 

• group term life insurance may be employerpaid basic life insurance employeepaid supplemental life insurance or a combination thereof • group universal life insurance is a voluntary life insurance product in which the owner may accumulate a cash value the cash value earns interest at rates declared from time to time subject to a minimum guaranteed contracted rate and may be borrowed withdrawn or within certain limits used to fund future life insurance coverage other products and services 

• personal accident insurance coverage consists primarily of accidental death and dismemberment and travel accident insurance to employers • specialty insurance services consist of disability and life accident and hospital indemnity products to professional or trade associations and financial institutions • voluntary products and services include plans that provide employers with administrative solutions designed to provide a complete and simple way to manage their benefits program these voluntary offerings include accidental injury insurance critical illness coverage and hospital care coverage and provide additional dollar payouts to employees for unexpected accidents hospitalization or more serious illnesses 

 

premiums charged for disability and term life insurance products are usually established in advance of the policy period are generally guaranteed for one to three years but selectively guaranteed for up to five years policies are generally subject to termination by the policyholder or by the insurance company annually premium rates reflect assumptions about future claims expenses credit risk investment returns and profit margins these assumptions may be based in whole or in part on prior experience of the account or on a pool of accounts depending on the group size and the statistical credibility of the experience that varies by product 

premiums for group universal life insurance products consist of mortality and administrative charges assessed against the policyholders fund balance interest credited and mortality charges for group universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected interest and mortality experience mortality charges are subject to maximum guaranteed rates and interest credited on cash values is subject to minimum guaranteed rates as stated in the policy 

the premiums for these products are typically collected within the coverage year and then invested in assets that match the duration of the expected benefit payments that occur over many future years primarily for disability benefits with significant investments in longerduration securities net investment income is a critical element of profitability for this segment 

the effectiveness of returntowork programs and morbidity levels will impact the profitability of disability insurance products our claim experience and industry data indicate a correlation between disability claim incidence levels and economic conditions with submitted claims rising under adverse economic conditions although the extent of this impact is unclear for life insurance products the degree to which future experience deviates from mortality and expense assumptions also affects profitability 

to reduce our exposure to large individual and catastrophic losses under group life disability and accidental death policies as well as our more recent accidental injury and critical illness policies we purchase reinsurance from a diverse group of unaffiliated reinsurers our comprehensive reinsurance program consists of excess of loss treaties and catastrophe coverage designed to mitigate earnings volatility and provide surplus protection 

 

• commercial commercial market segments are comprised of national middle market and select • national multistate employers with 5000 or more usbased fulltime employees • middle market employers generally with 250 to 4999 usbased fulltime employees • select employers generally with up to 249 eligible employees 

 

• insurance broker and consultants sales representatives distribute our products and services to a broad group of insurance brokers and consultants across the united states  

back to contents 

part i item 1 business 

• direct sales representatives distribute our products and services directly to employers unions and other groups or individuals across the united states this may take the form of inperson contact telephonic or group selling venues 

 

the principal competitive factors that affect the group disability and life segment are underwriting and pricing the quality and effectiveness of claims management relative operating efficiency investment and risk management distribution methodologies and producer relations the breadth and variety of products and services offered the quality of customer service and more importantly the state of the tools and technology available for customers clients consultants and producers for certain products with longerterm liabilities such as group longterm disability insurance the financial strength of the insurer as indicated by ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies is also a competitive factor 

• national insurers unum the hartford prudential lincoln and metlife compete with us on a variety of products and regions throughout the united states 

 

employers have expressed a growing interest in employee wellness absence management and productivity and recognize a strong link between employee health productivity and profitability as this interest grows we believe our healthy lifestyle and returntowork programs and integrated family medical leave disability and health care programs position us to deliver integrated solutions for employers and employees our strong disability management portfolio and fully integrated programs also provide tools for employers and employees to improve health status our focus on managing employees total absence enables us to increase the number and effectiveness of interventions and minimize disabling events 

the group insurance market remains highly competitive as the rising cost of medical coverage has forced companies to reevaluate their overall employee benefit spending resulting in lower volumes of group disability and life insurance business and more competitive pricing demographic shifts have further driven demand for products and services that are sufficiently flexible to meet the evolving needs of employers and employees who want innovative costeffective insurance solutions and employers continue to move towards greater employee participatory coverage and voluntary purchases as the market becomes more retailfocused our broad suite of voluntary offerings and continued focus on developing additional voluntary products and service capabilities positions us well to meet the needs of both employers and employees 

over the past few years there has been heightened review by state regulators of the claims handling practices within the disability and life insurance industry this has resulted in an increase in coordinated multistate examinations that target specific market practices in addition to regularly recurring examinations of an insurers overall operations conducted by an individual states regulators we have been subject to such an examination over the past several years see note 19d to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the lower level of interest rates in the united states over the last several years has constrained earnings growth in this segment due to lower yields on our fixedincome investments and higher benefit expenses resulting from the discounting of future claim payments at lower interest rates 

 

other operations includes the following 

 

the principal products of the coli business are permanent insurance contracts sold to corporations to provide coverage on the lives of certain employees for the purpose of financing employerpaid future benefit obligations permanent life insurance provides coverage that when adequately funded does not expire after a term of years the contracts are primarily nonparticipating universal life policies fees for universal life insurance products consist primarily of mortality and administrative charges assessed against the policyholders fund balance interest credited and mortality charges for universal life and mortality charges on variable universal life may be adjusted prospectively to reflect expected interest and mortality experience to reduce our exposure to large individual and catastrophe losses we purchase reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers

patient protection and the affordable care act aca 

the patient protection and affordable care act aca mandated broad changes affecting many aspects of the health care system the aca affects many aspects of health care including insured and selfinsured health benefit plans and pharmacy benefit managers our business model is impacted by the aca including our relationships with current and future producers and health care providers products service providers and technologies key provisions of the aca include the imposition of a nontax deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments on health insurers the creation of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small group employers to purchase insurance coverage and minimum loss ratios for our commercial and medicare part d business other provisions of the aca in effect include reduced medicare advantage premium rates the requirement to cover preventive services with no enrollee costsharing banning the use of lifetime and annual limits on the dollar amount of essential health benefits increasing restrictions on rescinding coverage extending coverage of dependents up to age 26 enforcement mechanisms and rules related to healthcare fraud and abuse enforcement activities and certain pharmacy benefit transparency requirements the employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more fulltime employees to offer affordable health insurance that provides minimum value each as defined under the aca to fulltime employees and their dependents including children up to age 26 or be subject to penalties based on employer size the aca also changed certain tax laws to effectively limit tax deductions for certain employee compensation paid by health insurers 

since its adoption there have been several attempts to repeal or limit the utility of the aca the current administration has issued several executive orders and approved legislative changes that affect the aca the impacts of which are not yet fully known among other things these actions restricted agencies from taking certain actions that would impose a fiscal burden on any state individual provider insurer recipient of health care services purchaser of health insurance or maker of medical devices products or medications and stopped payment of costsharing reduction subsidies to insurers in december 2017 us tax reform legislation was signed into law that among other things reduced the individual mandate penalty for individuals without health insurance to zero dollars effective january 1 2019 as a result of this change a federal district court has ruled that the individual mandate is unconstitutional thereby leaving in doubt whether the entire aca is unconstitutional until there is a final judicial determination on appeal 

additionally in 2017 the current administration issued an executive order asking the dol to revise the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa regulations to make it easier for employers particularly small employers to associate for the purpose of sponsoring large group health plans and thereby avoid the acas small group market reform eg communityrating and mandated coverage of essential health benefits that impaired the affordability of providing health coverage to their employees in the spring of 2018 the dol issued final rules that revised the definition of employer in the erisa rules to make it easier for employers including selfemployed individuals to form bona fide employer groups all of whose employees would be counted in determining whether they were small or large groups for purposes of the aca while the regulation of these groupings by state insurance departments is not affected by the dols final association health plan rules the final rules have resulted in an increase in interest among employers associations producers and benefit consultants in forming new groupings for purposes of offering insured or selffunded group health plans 

medicare and medicaid regulations

administrative discretion our medicaid and dualeligible products are regulated by cms state medicaid agencies audit our performance to determine compliance with contracts and regulations 

cms evaluates medicare advantage plans and part d plans under its star rating system the star rating system considers various measures adopted by cms including for example quality of care preventative services chronic illness management coverage determinations and appeals and customer satisfaction a plans star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform very well are able to market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans medicare advantage plans qualitybonus payments are determined by the star rating with plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for such payments the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater 

cms uses a riskadjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to customers health status the riskadjustment model generally pays more where a plans membership has higher expected costs under this model rates paid to medicare advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard medicarecovered benefits to an enrollee with a national average risk profile that baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership under the riskadjustment methodology medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to the plans which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government feeforservice program 

on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule titled proposed rule on changes to ma and part d programs for cy 2020 and 2021 the mapd proposed rule that would revise its risk adjustment data validation radv methodology by among other things excluding an adjustment for underlying feeforservice data errors ffs adjuster and extrapolating radv results at the contract level on november 30 2018 cms released proposed rules titled modernizing part d and medicare advantage to lower drug prices and reduce outofpocket expenses the proposed part d rule that focused on drug pricing including a proposal to amend the definition of negotiated price in part d to require part d plans to apply pharmacy price concessions at the point of sale when calculating a part d beneficiarys copayment the proposed mapd rule and the proposed part d rule are subject to revision through the comment process

noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant consequences including fines and penalties enrollment sanctions exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs limitations on expansion and criminal penalties 

false claims act and antikickback laws 

our products and services are subject to numerous laws and regulations including the federal false claims act the false claims act and federal and state antikickback laws additionally the federal government has made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud waste and abuse a priority fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks in return for customer referrals billing for unnecessary medical services upcoding and improper marketing the regulations and contractual requirements in this area are complex are frequently modified and are subject to administrative discretion and judicial interpretation 

false claims act and related criminal provisions the false claims act imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims or false records or statements with respect to governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid to obtain reimbursement or for failure to return overpayments private individuals may bring qui tam or whistleblower suits against providers under the false claims act which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit the aca amended the federal antikickback laws to state any claim submitted to a federal or state healthcare program which violates the antikickback laws is also a false claim under the false claims act the false claims act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages resulting in the possibility of substantial financial liabilities criminal statutes similar to the false claims act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement it knows to be false fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency the corporation may be fined conviction under these statutes may also result in exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs many states have also enacted laws similar to the false claims act some of which may include criminal penalties substantial fines and treble damages 

antikickback and referral laws subject to certain exceptions and safe harbors the federal antikickback statute generally prohibits among other things knowingly and willfully paying receiving or offering any payment or other remuneration to induce a person to purchase lease order or arrange for items including prescription drugs or services reimbursable in whole or in part under medicare medicaid or another federal healthcare program many states have similar laws some of which apply similar antikickback prohibitions to items or services reimbursable by nongovernmental payors sanctions for violating these federal and state antikickback laws may include criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the federal and state healthcare programs 

antikickback laws have been cited as a partial basis along with state consumer protection laws described below for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies andor payors in connection with product conversion or promotion programs other antikickback laws may be applicable to arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers such as the public contracts antikickback act the erisa health plan antikickback statute the federal stark law and various state antikickback restrictions 

in february 2019 hhs proposed changes to the federal antikickback safe harbor to exclude regulatory protection for rebates between drug manufacturers and medicare part d plans medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers in the context of these government programs the proposed regulations in their current form apply solely to medicare part d and medicaid programs which include our government business in the integrated medical segment the proposed regulations also seek to create new safe harbor protections for fixed fee services arrangements between drug manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers as well as protections for discounts offered at

the point of sale hhs has stated that it does not intend for the proposal to have an effect on existing protections for valuebased arrangements between manufacturers and plan sponsors under medicare part d and medicaid mcos while legislative and regulatory discussions on the other issues raised in the blueprint continue to be the subject of legislative and regulatory activity they have yet to be implemented in any form 

federal civil monetary penalties law the federal civil monetary penalty statute provides for civil monetary penalties against any person who gives something of value to a medicare or medicaid program beneficiary which the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiarys selection of a particular provider for medicare or medicaid items or services under this law our whollyowned home delivery pharmacies specialty pharmacies and home health providers are restricted from offering certain items of value to influence a medicare or medicaid patients use of services the aca also includes several civil monetary provisions such as penalties for the failure to report and return a known overpayment and failure to grant timely access to the oig under certain circumstances 

federal and state oversight of governmentsponsored health care programs 

participation in governmentsponsored health care programs subjects us to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations and risks associated with audits conducted under these programs these audits may occur years after the provision of services risks include potential fines and penalties restrictions on our ability to participate or expand our presence in certain programs and restrictions on marketing our plans for example with respect to our medicare advantage business cms and the oig perform audits to determine a health plans compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including program audits and compliance with proper coding practices sometimes referred to as risk adjustment data validation audits or radv audits 

separately the doj is currently conducting an industry review of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes including review of medical charts of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d 

for our medicare part d business compliance with fraud and abuse enforcement practices is monitored through recovery audit contractor audits in which thirdparty contractors conduct postpayment reviews on a contingency fee basis to detect and correct improper payments 

government procurement regulations 

we have a contract with the dod which subjects us to all of the applicable federal acquisition regulations far and the dod far supplement which govern federal government contracts further there are other federal and state laws applicable to our dod arrangement and our arrangements with other clients that may be subject to government procurement regulations in addition certain of our clients participate as contracting carriers in the federal employees health benefits program administered by the office of personnel management which includes various pharmacy benefit management standards 

employee retirement income security act 

our domestic subsidiaries sell most of their products and services to sponsors of employee benefit plans that are governed by erisa erisa is a complex set of federal laws and regulations enforced by the irs and the dol as well as the courts erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationship between us the employers that maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to erisa and participants in such plans certain of our domestic subsidiaries are also subject to requirements imposed by erisa affecting claim payment and appeals procedures for individual health insurance and insured and selfinsured group health plans and for the insured dental disability life and accident plans we administer certain of our domestic subsidiaries also may contractually agree to comply with these requirements on behalf of the selfinsured dental disability life and accident plans they administer we believe the conduct of our pharmacy benefit management business is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of erisa however there can be no assurances that the dol may not assert that pharmacy benefit managers are fiduciaries from time to time states have considered legislation to declare a pharmacy benefit manager or medical benefit manager a fiduciary with respect to its clients 

plans subject to erisa can also be subject to state laws and the legal question of whether and to what extent erisa preempts a state law will continue to be subject to court interpretation 

privacy security and data standards regulations 

many of our activities involve the receipt or use of confidential health and other personal information in addition we use aggregated and deidentified data for our own research and analysis purposes and in some cases provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and its implementing regulations hipaa impose minimum standards on health insurers pharmacy benefit managers hmos health plans health care providers and clearinghouses for the privacy and security of protected health information hipaa also established rules that standardize the format and content of certain electronic transactions including but not limited to eligibility and claims 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech imposes additional contracting requirements for covered entities the extension of privacy and security provisions to business associates the requirement to provide notification to various parties in the event of a data breach of protected health information and enhanced financial penalties for hipaa violations including potential criminal penalties for individuals in the conduct of our business depending on the circumstances we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate 

the federal grammleachbliley act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of nonpublic information to nonaffiliated third parties and requires financial institutions including insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures state departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law

a number of states have adopted data security laws and regulations regulating data security and requiring security breach notification that may apply to us in certain circumstances and are increasingly focused on protecting individuals from identity theft neither hipaa nor the grammleachbliley privacy regulations preempt more stringent state laws and regulations in addition international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of personal information are generally more stringent than in the united states and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 

the cybersecurity information sharing act of 2015 cisa encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and among other things directs hhs to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry states have also begun to issue regulations specifically related to cybersecurity in october 2017 the national association of insurance commissioners naic an organization of state insurance regulators adopted the insurance data security model law that creates rules for insurers and other covered entities addressing data security investigation and notification of breaches this includes maintaining an information security program based on ongoing risk assessment overseeing thirdparty service providers investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event as the model law is intended to serve as model legislation only states will need to enact legislation for the model law to become mandatory and enforceable we will continue to monitor states activity regarding cybersecurity regulation 

the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr which became enforceable in may 2018 introduced a number of new obligations regarding the handling of personal data of european customers gdpr provides certain individual privacy rights to certain persons whose data we may store and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance than previous european data protection laws in addition many countries outside of europe where we conduct business are considering data protection laws and regulations that include requirements modeled after those in the gdpr 

consumer protection laws 

we engage in directtoconsumer activities and are increasingly offering mobile and webbased solutions to our customers we are therefore subject to federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and other consumer protection laws and regulations such as the telephone consumer protection act and the canspam act in particular the federal trade commission is increasingly exercising its enforcement authority in the areas of consumer privacy and data security with a focus on webbased mobile data and big data federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information 

most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations and multistate settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs such statutes have also been cited as the basis for claims or investigations by state attorneys general relative to privacy and data security 

office of foreign assets control sanctions and antimoney laundering 

we are also subject to regulation by the office of foreign assets control of the department of the treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes based on us foreign policy and national security goals 

certain of our products are subject to the department of the treasury antimoney laundering regulations under the bank secrecy act 

in addition we may be subject to similar regulations in nonus jurisdictions in which we operate 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

many states in which our subsidiaries operate limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed health care providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business 

network access legislation 

a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability or our clients ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove a provider from a network such legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy or provider willing to meet the plans terms and conditions for network participation any willing provider legislation or may direct that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures due process legislation 

certain states have enacted legislation prohibiting certain pharmacy benefit management clients from imposing additional copayments deductibles limitations on benefits or other conditions conditions on covered individuals utilizing a retail pharmacy when the same conditions are not otherwise imposed on covered individuals utilizing home delivery pharmacies however the legislation requires the retail pharmacy to agree to the same reimbursement amounts and terms and conditions as are imposed on the home delivery pharmacies an increase in the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies may have a negative impact on the number of prescriptions filled through home delivery we anticipate additional states will consider similar legislation 

legislation affecting plan design 

some states have enacted legislation that prohibits managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive benefit plan design features and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans including provisions relating to the

part i item 1 business 

pharmacy benefit for example some states under socalled freedom of choice legislation provide members of the plan may not be required to use network providers but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use nonnetwork providers some states have also enacted legislation which as described above can negatively impact the use of costsaving network configurations for plan sponsors other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering members financial incentives for use of home delivery pharmacies medicare and some states have issued guidance and regulations which limit our ability to fill or refill prescriptions electronically submitted by a physician to our home delivery pharmacy without first obtaining consent from the patient such restrictions generate additional costs and limit our ability to maximize efficiencies which could otherwise be gained through the electronic prescription and automatic refill processes legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention or to require coverage of all food and drug administration approved drugs other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and require health plan coverage of specific drugs if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician states are also standardizing the process for and restricting the use of utilization management rules and shortening the time frames within which prescription drug prior authorization determinations must be made even where states do not regulate pharmacy benefit or utilization management companies directly these laws will apply to many of our clients including managed care organizations and health insurers 

pharmacy benefit management and drug pricing regulation 

our pharmacy benefit management services are subject to numerous laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern and proposed legislation and regulations may govern critical practices including disclosure receipt and retention of rebates and other payments received from pharmaceutical manufacturers the receipt and retention of transmission fees from contracted pharmacies use of administration of andor changes to drug formularies maximum allowable cost list pricing andor clinical programs disclosure of data to third parties drug utilization management practices the level of duty a pharmacy benefit manager owes its clients or customers configuration of pharmacy networks the operations of our subsidiary pharmacies disclosure of negotiated provider reimbursement rates disclosure of negotiated drug rebates calculation of customer cost share for prescription drug claims disclosure of fees associated with administrative service agreements and patient care programs that are attributable to customers drug utilization and registration or licensing of pharmacy benefit managers some states have adopted socalled most favored nation legislation which provides that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program must give the state the best price the pharmacy makes available to any thirdparty plan 

prescription drug pricing and the role of pharmacy benefit managers have been a focus of the current administration in may 2018 the current administration announced a blueprint titled american patients first which considers a series of drug pricing proposals including among other things removal of the antikickback safe harbor protection for rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefit managers and improvements to pricing transparency in october 2018 congress enacted laws that prohibited pharmacy benefit managers and insurers from restricting pharmacies from providing drug pricing information to a plan enrollee when there is a difference between the cost of the drug under insurance and the cost of the drug when purchased without insurance see also false claims act and antikickback laws for a discussion of hhs proposed rule changes to the federal antikickback safe harbor to exclude regulatory protection for rebates between drug manufacturers and medicare part d plans medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers in the context of these government programs 

some states have enacted statutes regulating the use of maximum allowable cost mac pricing these statutes referred to as mac transparency laws generally require pharmacy benefit managers to disclose specific information related to mac pricing to pharmacies and provide certain appeal rights for pharmacies mac transparency laws also restrict the application of mac and may require operational changes to maintain compliance with the law some states have also enacted laws regulating pharmacy pricing and protecting the profitability of pharmacies for dispensing certain macpriced drugs some states have enacted laws requiring that the customer cost share for a prescription drug claim not exceed certain price points such as the pharmacys usual and customary charge or its contracted reimbursement for the drug 

in march 2018 the naic adopted changes to the health carrier prescription drug benefit management model act the changes address issues relating to i transparency accuracy and disclosure regarding prescription drug formularies and formulary changes during a policy year ii accessibility of prescription drug benefits using a variety of pharmacy options and iii tiered prescription drug formularies and discriminatory benefit design while the actions of the naic do not have the force of law they may influence states to adopt laws based on the model legislation 

the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs reimbursed through state medicaid programs including through medicaid managed care organizations manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a 231 of the average manufacturer price amp paid by retail community pharmacies or by wholesalers for certain drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies or b the difference between amp and the best price available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program and certain other government programs with certain exceptions we negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and in certain circumstances sell services to drug manufacturers investigations are being and have been conducted by certain governmental entities which call into question whether a drugs best price was properly calculated and reported with respect to rebates paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs we are not responsible for such calculations reports or payments 

pharmacy regulation 

our home delivery and specialty pharmacies are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the states in which they are located most of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require outofstate home delivery pharmacies to register with or be licensed by the board of pharmacy or a similar regulatory body in the state these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the home delivery service is located although some states require compliance with certain laws in that state as it impacts or relates to drugs distributed or dispensed into those states 

our various pharmacy facilities also maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs in addition several of our pharmacy facilities are

participating providers under medicare part d and as a condition to becoming a participating provider under medicare part d the pharmacies are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to medicare part d 

other statutes and regulations affect our home delivery and specialty pharmacy operations including the federal and state antikickback laws and the federal civil monetary penalty law described above federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling packaging advertising adulteration and security of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances the federal trade commission requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising to stock a reasonable supply of the product to be sold to fill mail orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate the united states postal service also has significant statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail 

financial reporting internal control and corporate governance 

regulators closely monitor the financial condition of licensed insurance companies and hmos states regulate the form and content of statutory financial statements the type and concentration of permitted investments and corporate governance over financial reporting our insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file periodic financial reports and schedules with regulators in most of the jurisdictions in which they do business as well as annual financial statements audited by independent registered public accounting firms certain insurance and hmo subsidiaries are required to file an annual report of internal control over financial reporting with most jurisdictions in which they do business insurance and hmo subsidiaries operations and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies many states have expanded regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of insurance and hmo subsidiaries as a result of model regulations adopted by the naic with elements similar to corporate governance and risk oversight disclosure requirements under federal securities laws 

guaranty associations indemnity funds risk pools and administrative funds 

most states and certain nonus jurisdictions require insurance companies to support guaranty associations or indemnity funds that are established to pay claims on behalf of insolvent insurance companies some states have similar laws relating to hmos and other payors such as consumer operated and oriented plans coops established under the aca in the united states these associations levy assessments on member insurers licensed in a particular state to pay such claims certain states require hmos to participate in guaranty funds special risk pools and administrative funds for additional information about guaranty funds and other assessments see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

certain states continue to require health insurers and hmos to participate in assigned risk plans joint underwriting authorities pools or other residual market mechanisms to cover risks not acceptable under normal underwriting standards although some states have eliminated these requirements as a result of the aca 

solvency and capital requirements 

many states have adopted some form of the naic model solvencyrelated laws and riskbased capital rules rbc rules for life and health insurance companies the rbc rules recommend a minimum level of capital depending on the types and quality of investments held the types of business written and the types of liabilities incurred if the ratio of the insurers adjusted surplus to its riskbased capital falls below statutorily required minimums the insurer could be subject to regulatory actions ranging from increased scrutiny to conservatorship 

in addition various nonus jurisdictions prescribe minimum surplus requirements that are based upon solvency liquidity and reserve coverage measures our hmos and life and health insurance subsidiaries as well as nonus insurance subsidiaries are compliant with applicable rbc and nonus surplus rules 

the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment model act orsa adopted by the naic provides requirements and principles for maintaining a group solvency assessment and a risk management framework and reflects a broader approach to us insurance regulation orsa includes a requirement to file an annual orsa summary report in the lead state of domicile to date an overwhelming majority of the states have adopted the same or similar versions of orsa we file our orsa report annually as required 

holding company laws 

our domestic insurance companies and certain of our hmos are subject to state laws regulating subsidiaries of insurance holding companies under such laws certain dividends distributions and other transactions between an insurance company or an hmo subsidiary and its affiliates may require notification to or approval by one or more state insurance commissioners in addition the holding company acts of states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or hmo subsidiary without prior regulatory approval 

marketing advertising and products 

in most states our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are required to certify compliance with applicable advertising regulations on an annual basis our insurance companies and hmo subsidiaries are also required by most states to file and secure regulatory approval of products prior to the marketing advertising and sale of such products 

licensing and registration requirements 

certain subsidiaries contract to provide claim administration utilization management and other related services for the administration of selfinsured benefit plans these subsidiaries may be subject to state thirdparty administration and other licensing requirements and regulation as well as thirdparty accreditation requirements 

we have received full accreditation for utilization review accreditation commission pharmacy benefit management version 22 standards which includes quality standards for drug utilization management and select subsidiaries have received full accreditation for utilization

review accreditation commission for health utilization management version 72 which includes quality standards for medical utilization management 

certain states have adopted pharmacy benefit management registration andor disclosure laws in addition to registration laws some states have adopted legislation mandating disclosure of various aspects of our financial practices including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms 

our international subsidiaries are often required to be licensed when entering new markets or starting new operations in certain jurisdictions the licensure requirements for these subsidiaries vary by country and are subject to change 

 

our operations outside the united states expose us to laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies and regulators including those related to financial and other disclosures corporate governance privacy data protection data mining data transfer intellectual property labor and employment consumer protection directtoconsumer communications activities tax anticorruption and antimoney laundering foreign laws and rules may include requirements that are different from or more stringent than similar requirements in the united states 

our operations in countries outside the united states 

• are subject to local regulations of the jurisdictions where we operate • in some cases are subject to regulations in the jurisdictions where customers reside and • in all cases are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa in particular in south korea where we are selling insurance products directly to individual customers regulators are focused on protecting the rights of individual customers by enforcing treating customers fairly concepts this regulatory focus results in rigorous data localization requirements network separation obligations and system monitoring restrictions as well as obligations to closely monitor marketing communications and sales scripts antimoney laundering requirements in south korea and other asian countries where we do business also impose obligations to collect certain information about each customer at time of sale and to risk rank each customer to determine possible future money laundering risk 

the fcpa prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official or employee to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage outside of the united states we may interact with government officials in several different capacities as regulators of our insurance business as clients or partners who are stateowned or partially stateowned as health care professionals who are employed by the government as hospitals that are stateowned and as officials issuing permits in connection with real estate transactions violations of the fcpa and other anticorruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and doj have increased their enforcement activities with respect to fcpa the uk bribery act of 2010 applies to all companies with a nexus to the united kingdom under this act any voluntary disclosures of fcpa violations may be shared with united kingdom authorities thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions 

 

premiums and fees from cms represented 16 of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 under a number of contracts we are not dependent on business from one or a few customers other than cms no one customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in 2018 we are not dependent on business from one or a few brokers or agents in addition our insurance businesses are generally not committed to accept a fixed portion of the business submitted by independent brokers and agents and generally all such business is subject to approval and acceptance

as a large global health service company operating in a complex industry we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity results of operations financial condition or the trading price of our securities you should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties discussed below together with other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed risk factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance 

 

future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively 

the future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to effectively implement and execute our strategic and operational initiatives successfully executing on these initiatives depends on a number of factors including our ability to 

• differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors • develop and introduce new and innovative products or programs particularly in response to government regulation and the increased focus on consumerdirected products • grow our commercial product portfolio • identify and introduce the proper mix or integration of products that will be accepted by the marketplace • identify products and solutions that focus on improving patient outcomes and assist in controlling costs • evaluate drugs for efficacy value and price to assist clients in selecting a costeffective formulary • offer costeffective home delivery pharmacy and specialty services • leverage purchase volume to deliver discounts to health benefit providers • attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees • attract develop and maintain collaborative relationships with a sufficient number of qualified partners • attract new and maintain existing customer and client relationships • transition health care providers from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased system • improve medical cost competitiveness in our targeted markets • manage our medical pharmacy administrative and other operating costs effectively and • contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacy providers on favorable terms for our strategic initiatives to succeed we must effectively integrate our operations including with express scripts and other acquired businesses actively work to ensure consistency throughout the organization and promote a global mindset along with a focus on individual customers and clients if we fail to do so our business may be unable to grow as planned or the result of expansion may be unsatisfactory we will be unable to rapidly respond to competitive economic and regulatory changes if we do not make important strategic and operational decisions quickly define our appetite for risk specifically implement new governance managerial and organizational processes smoothly and communicate roles and responsibilities clearly if these initiatives fail or are not executed on effectively our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be negatively affected 

we operate in a highly competitive evolving and rapidly changing industry and our failure to adapt could negatively impact our business 

the health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving any significant shifts in the structure of the industry could alter industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients industry shifts could result and have resulted from among other things 

• a large intra or interindustry merger or industry consolidation • strategic alliances • new or alternative business models • continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other health care providers as well as changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and health care providers • new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health service industry • the ability of larger employers and clients to contract directly with providers

part i item 1a risk factors 

• technological changes and rapid shifts in the use of technology such as telemedicine • the impact or consequences of legislation or regulatory changes • changes in the united states postal service or the consolidation of shipping carriers • increased drug acquisition cost or unexpected changes to drug pricing trend • change in the generic drug market or the failure of new generic drugs to come to market • a general decrease in drug utilization or • a general increase in utilization under riskbased contracts in the medical benefit management market our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our failure to compete effectively to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors and maintain or increase market share could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we operate in a highly competitive environment and an industry subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer and client needs legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors in particular markets our competitors may have greater better or more established capabilities resources market share reputation or business relationships or lower profit margin or financial return expectations our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between our competitors and us our express scripts client contracts generally have threeyear terms as described in greater detail in the description of our business in item 1 above see page 11 of this form 10k one of our key clients in the health services segment is the united states department of defense if one or more of our large clients either terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason including as a result of being acquired or if the provisions of a contract with a large client are modified renewed or otherwise changed with terms less favorable to us our results of operations could be adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in decreases in the trading price of our securities or other adverse effects 

our success depends in part on our ability to compete effectively in our markets set prices appropriately in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share increase customers as planned differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that provide enhanced value to our customers provide quality and satisfactory levels of service and retain accounts with favorable medical cost experience or more profitable products versus retaining or increasing our customer base in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience or less profitable products 

we must remain competitive to attract new customers retain existing customers and further integrate additional product and service offerings to succeed in this highly competitive marketplace it is imperative we maintain a strong reputation the negative reputational impact of a significant event including a failure to execute on customer or client contracts or strategic or operational initiatives or failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our customers could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable arrangements which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we face price competition and other pressures that could compress our margins or result in premiums that are insufficient to cover the cost of services delivered to our customers 

while we compete on the basis of many service and qualityrelated factors we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition our client contracts are subject to negotiation as clients seek to contain their costs including by reducing benefits offered increasingly our clients seek to negotiate performance guarantees that require us to pay penalties if the guaranteed performance standard is not met clients can easily move between our competitors and us our clients are wellinformed and typically have knowledgeable consultants that seek competing bids from our competitors before contract renewal in addition as brokers and benefit consultants seek to enhance their revenue streams they look to take on services that we typically provide each of these events could negatively impact our financial results 

further federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict our ability to implement changes in premium rates fiscal or other concerns related to the governmentsponsored programs in which we participate such as medicare may cause decreasing reimbursement rates delays in premium payments or insufficient increases in reimbursement rates any limitation on our ability to maintain or increase our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of customers or clients resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

premiums in the integrated medical segment are generally set for oneyear periods and are priced well in advance of the date on which the contract commences or renews our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted midyear in the year before the contract year although we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the contract period actual costs may exceed what we estimate in setting premiums our health care costs also are affected by external events that we cannot forecast or project and over which we have little or no control as well as changes in customers health care utilization patterns and provider billing practices our profitability depends in part on our ability to accurately predict price for and effectively manage future health care costs relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenue can result in significant changes in our financial results 

strong competition within the pharmacy benefit business has also generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings these competitive factors have historically applied pressure on our operating margins and caused many companies including us to reduce the prices charged for products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the formulary fees and related rebates received from pharmaceutical manufacturers our inability to maintain positive trends or

failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the reserves we hold for expected medical claims are based on estimates that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable if actual claims exceed our estimates our operating results could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective actions to contain future costs may be limited 

we maintain and record medical claims reserves on our balance sheet for estimated future payments our estimates of health care costs payable are based on a number of factors including historical claim experience but this estimation process requires extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimates and the accuracy of the estimates is highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and processing patterns andor procedures changes in customer base and product mix changes in the utilization of medical andor other covered services changes in medical cost trends changes in our medical management practices and the introduction of new benefits and products if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited because establishing these reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing medical claims reserves 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians hospitals and other health service providers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other health service providers and facilities to provide health services to our customers our results of operations are substantially dependent on our ability to contract for these services at competitive prices in any particular market physicians hospitals and health service providers may enter into exclusive arrangements with competitors or simply refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or less desirable products or services for our customers in some markets certain providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations and multispecialty physician groups may have significant or controlling market positions that could result in a diminished bargaining position for us if providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected establishing collaborative arrangements with physician groups specialist groups independent practice associations hospitals and health care delivery systems is key to our strategic focus to transition from volumebased feeforservice arrangements to a valuebased health care system if such collaborative arrangements do not result in the lower medical costs that we project or if we fail to attract health care providers to such arrangements or are less successful at implementing such arrangements than our competitors our attractiveness to customers may be reduced and our ability to profitably grow our business may be adversely affected 

our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers may also be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us such as changes in medicare andor medicaid reimbursement levels increasing pressure on revenue and other pressures on health care providers and increasing consolidation activity among hospitals physician groups and providers continuing consolidation among physicians hospitals and other providers the emergence of accountable care organizations vertical integration of providers and other entities changes in the organizational structures chosen by physicians hospitals and providers and new market entrants including those not traditionally in the health care industry may affect the way providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape in which we operate in some instances these organizations may compete directly with us potentially affecting the way we price our products and services or cause us to incur increased costs if we change our operations to be more competitive 

outofnetwork providers are not limited by any agreement with us in the amounts they bill while benefit plans place limits on the amount of charges that will be considered for reimbursement outofnetwork providers have become increasingly sophisticated and aggressive and such limitations can be difficult to enforce as a result the outcome of disputes where we do not have a provider contract may cause us to pay higher medical or other benefit costs than we projected 

if we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with among other things 

• discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies • discounts in the form of rebates for drug utilization • fees for administering rebate programs including invoicing allocating and collecting rebates • fees for services provided to pharmaceutical manufacturers by our specialty pharmacies and • access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals by our specialty pharmacies our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers are typically nonexclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party the consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition arrangements between payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums adoption of new laws rules or regulations or changes in or new interpretations of existing laws rules or regulations relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations

part i item 1a risk factors 

if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers our business and financial results could be impaired 

more than 68000 retail pharmacies which represent over 99 of all united states retail pharmacies participated in one or more of our networks as of december 31 2018 the ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately 61 of the total number of stores in our largest network in certain geographic areas of the united states our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains contracts with retail pharmacies are generally nonexclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party if one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us or is able to renegotiate terms substantially less favorable to us our customers access to retail pharmacies andor our business could be materially adversely affected the entry of one or more additional large pharmacy chains into the pharmacy benefit management business the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks or reduced pharmacy access under our networks could have a negative impact on our claims volume andor our competitiveness in the marketplace which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations 

changes in drug pricing or industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy clients generally use average wholesale price or awp which is published by a third party as a benchmark to establish pricing for prescription drugs if awp is no longer published by third parties we adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry or future changes in drug prices substantially deviate from our expectations the short or longterm impacts may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as a global company we face political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks that present challenges and could negatively affect our multinational operations andor our longterm growth 

as a global company our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations these risks can vary substantially by market and include political legal operational regulatory economic and other risks including government intervention that we do not face in our us operations the global nature of our business and operations may present challenges including but not limited to those arising from

international operations also require us to devote significant resources to implement controls and systems in new markets to comply with and to ensure that our vendors and partners comply with us and foreign laws prohibiting bribery corruption and money laundering in addition to other regulations regarding among other things our products directtoconsumer communications customer privacy data protection and data residency violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or employees restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to establish constructive relations with nonus regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and longterm growth 

we are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions 

to improve operating costs productivity and efficiencies we contract with third parties for the provision of specific services our operations may be adversely affected if a third party fails to satisfy its obligations to us if the arrangement is terminated in whole or in part or if there is a

contractual dispute between us and the third party even though contracts are intended to provide certain protections we have limited control over the actions of third parties for example noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations any security breach involving one of our thirdparty vendors or a dispute between us and a thirdparty vendor related to our arrangement could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and reputation 

outsourcing also may require us to change our existing operations adopt new processes for managing these service providers andor redistribute responsibilities to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies if there are delays or difficulties in changing business processes or our thirdparty vendors do not perform as expected we may not realize or not realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of these relationships this could result in substantial costs or regulatory compliance issues divert managements attention from other strategic activities negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us terminating or transitioning in whole or in part arrangements with key vendors could result in additional costs or penalties risks of operational delays or potential errors and control issues during the termination or transition phase we may not be able to find an alternative vendor in a timely manner or on acceptable terms if there is an interruption in business or loss of access to data resulting from a security breach termination or transition in services we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and in turn our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

a significant disruption in service within our operations or among our key suppliers or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as claims processing and payment internet support and customer call centers data centers and corporate facilities processing new and renewal business maintaining appropriate shipment and storage conditions for prescriptions such as temperature and protection from contamination and mail order processing in some instances our ability to provide services or products including processing and dispensing prescriptions depends on the availability of services and products provided by suppliers pharmaceutical manufacturers vendors or shipping carriers any failure or disruption of our performance of or our ability to perform key business functions including through unavailability or cyberattack of our information technology systems or those of third parties could cause slower response times decreased levels of service satisfaction and harm to our reputation in addition because our information technology and other systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption our failure to implement adequate business continuity and disaster recovery strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers and clients which could have material adverse effects on our business and results of operations 

acquisitions including our acquisition of express scripts joint ventures and other transactions involve risks and we may not realize the expected benefits because of integration difficulties underperformance relative to our expectations and other challenges 

as part of our growth strategy we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions joint ventures licensing arrangements and other relationships collectively referred to as strategic transactions our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of these strategic transactions is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks including our ability to integrate operations resources and systems including data security systems in an efficient and effective manner 

the success of the express scripts acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of cigna and express scripts and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination this integration is a complex costly and timeconsuming process which may divert managements attention from ongoing business concerns 

key risks of the express scripts integration include but are not limited to retaining existing clients and attracting new clients on profitable terms maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees integrating two unique corporate cultures consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and realizing operational synergies integrating information technology communications programs financial procedures and operations and other systems procedures and policies coordinating geographically separate organizations managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company and necessary modifications to internal financial control standards 

integration activities may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of integration including with respect to express scripts may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected delays or issues encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on the revenues expenses operating results and financial condition of the combined company 

strategic transactions could result in increased costs including facilities and systems consolidation costs and costs to retain key employees decreases in expected revenues earnings or cash flows and goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of express scripts businesses although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of those businesses should allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all in addition the trading price of our securities may decline if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings if our operational cost savings estimates are not realized or the transaction costs related to the acquisition and integration are greater than expected the trading price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts 

further we may finance strategic transactions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price that could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders or by incurring additional debt that could impact our ability to access capital in the future 

in addition effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to mitigate the risk of fraud the integration of businesses including express scripts is likely to cause increasing complexity in our systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage any difficulties in assimilating businesses into our control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting

our business depends on our ability to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent on maintaining effective information systems as well as the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care professionals and to operate our business if our data were found to be inaccurate or unreliable due to fraud or other error or if we or any of the thirdparty service providers we engage were to fail to maintain information systems and data integrity effectively we could experience operational disruptions that may impact our clients customers and health care professionals and hinder our ability to provide services and products establish appropriate pricing for products and services retain and attract clients and customers establish reserves and report financial results timely and accurately and maintain regulatory compliance among other things 

our information technology strategy and execution are critical to our continued success we must continue to invest in longterm solutions that will enable us to anticipate customer needs and expectations enhance the customer experience act as a differentiator in the market and protect against cybersecurity risks and threats our success is dependent in large part on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continuing to deliver and enhance technology systems that support our business processes in a costefficient and resourceefficient manner increasing regulatory and legislative changes will place additional demands on our information technology infrastructure that could have a direct impact on resources available for other projects tied to our strategic initiatives in addition recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important we must also develop new systems to meet current market standards and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and customer needs failure to do so may present compliance challenges and impede our ability to deliver services in a competitive manner further because system development projects are longterm in nature they may be more costly than expected to complete and may not deliver the expected benefits upon completion our failure to effectively invest in implement improvements to and properly maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

as a large health service company we are subject to cyberattacks or other privacy or data security incidents if we are unable to prevent or contain the effects of any such attacks we may suffer exposure to substantial liability reputational harm loss of revenue or other damages 

our business depends on our clients and customers willingness to entrust us with their healthrelated and other sensitive personal information computer systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses or malware programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems we have been and will likely continue to be the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access cyberattacks or other computerrelated penetrations there have been and will likely continue to be large scale cyberattacks within the health service industry as we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally our exposure to data security and related cybersecurity risks increases including the risk of undetected attacks damage loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases if disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded we have implemented security technologies processes and procedures to protect consumer identity and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks however there are no assurances that such measures will be effective against all types of breaches 

cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to our proprietary systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties such as external service providers and the techniques used change frequently or are often not recognized until after they have been launched those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers in addition while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services our vendors and in turn their own service providers may become subject to the same types of security breaches finally our offices may be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks acts of vandalism or theft misplaced or lost data human error or similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our customers and clients data 

the costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyberincident could be significant our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers 

in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us our customers or other thirdparties could expose our customers private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft unauthorized dissemination of confidential and proprietary information about our business and strategy also could negatively affect the achievement of our strategic initiatives such events could cause us to breach our contractual confidentiality obligations and violate applicable laws these events would negatively affect our ability to compete others trust in us our reputation customer base and revenues and expose us to mandatory disclosure including to the media litigation and other enforcement proceedings material fines penalties andor remediation costs and compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders and other adverse actions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or liquidity

there are various risks associated with participating in governmentsponsored programs such as medicare including dependence upon government funding compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight 

through our government business we contract with cms and various state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services including medicare advantage plans and medicareapproved prescription drug plans if we fail to comply with cmss contractual requirements including data submission enrollment and marketing provider network adequacy provider directory accuracy quality measures claims payment continuity of care and call center performance we may be subject to administrative actions fines or other penalties that could impact our profitability 

revenues from medicare programs are dependent in whole or in part upon annual funding from the federal government through cms andor applicable state or local governments funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control including general economic conditions continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities these entities generally have the right to not renew or cancel their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available unanticipated changes in funding such as the application of sequestration by the federal or state governments or the failure to provide for continued appropriations or regular ongoing scheduled payments to us could substantially reduce our revenues and profitability 

the medicare program has been the subject of regulatory reform initiatives the premium rates paid to medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans are established by contract although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors many of which are outside our control the star rating system is subject to change annually by cms which may make it more difficult to achieve four stars or greater a plans star rating affects its image in the market and plans that perform well are able to market more effectively and for longer periods of time than other plans our medicare advantage plans and medicare part d plans operating results premium revenue and benefit offerings are likely to continue to be significantly determined by their star ratings a portion of each medicare advantage plans reimbursement is tied to the plans star rating with those plans receiving a rating of four or more stars eligible for qualitybased bonus payments there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses

on november 1 2018 cms released a proposed rule that would revise its risk adjustment data validation methodology by among other things excluding an adjustment for underlying feeforservice data errors and extrapolating radv results at the contract level if adopted in its current form the rule could have a detrimental impact to all medicare advantage insurers and affect the ability of plans to deliver high quality health care for the population served while it is uncertain that cms will issue the rule as proposed if adopted it could have a material impact on the companys future results of operations 

our participation in health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers involves uncertainties associated with mix and volume of business and could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows the executive order signed in october 2017 that halted payment of the cost sharing reduction subsidies has created additional uncertainty regarding the future of public health insurance exchanges risk adjustment balances are subject to audit and adjustment by cms 

any failure to comply with various state and federal health care laws and regulations including those directed at preventing fraud and abuse in government funded programs could result in investigations or litigation such as actions under the federal false claims act and similar whistleblower statutes under state laws this could subject us to damage awards fines penalties or other enforcement actions restrictions on our ability to market or enroll new customers limits on expansion restrictions or exclusions from programs or other agreements with federal or state governmental agencies which could adversely impact our business cash flows financial condition results of operations and reputation 

we face risks related to litigation regulatory audits and investigations 

we are routinely involved in numerous claims lawsuits regulatory audits investigations and other legal matters arising for the most part in the ordinary course of business including that of administering and insuring employee benefit programs these legal matters could include benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims claims arising from consumer protection laws false claims act laws claims disputes under federal or state laws and disputes regarding reinsurance arrangements employment and employment discriminationrelated suits antitrust claims employee benefit claims wage and hour claims tax privacy intellectual property and whistleblower claims shareholder suits and other securities law claims and real estate disputes in addition we have incurred and likely will continue to incur liability for practices and claims related to our health care business such as marketing misconduct failure to timely or appropriately pay for or provide health care provider network structure poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged provider disputes including disputes over compensation or contractual provisions erisa claims allegations related to calculations of cost sharing and claims related to our administration of selffunded business there are currently and may be in the future attempts to bring class action lawsuits against the company and other companies in our industry individual plaintiffs also may bring multiple claims regarding the same subject matter against us and other companies in our industry 

court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages may be sought we seek to procure insurance coverage to cover some of these potential liabilities however certain potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may be insufficient to cover the entire damages awarded in addition certain types of damages such as punitive damages may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future it is possible that the resolution of current or future legal matters and claims could result in changes to our industry and business practices losses material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity or damage to our reputation 

we are frequently the subject of regulatory market conduct and other reviews audits and investigations by state insurance and health and welfare and pharmacy departments attorneys general cms and the oig and comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions with respect to our medicare advantage and medicare part d businesses cms and oig perform audits to determine a health plans compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations including compliance with proper coding practices and fraud and abuse enforcement practices through audits designed to detect and correct improper payments the department of justice is conducting an industry review of the risk adjustment data submission practices and business processes including review of medical charts of cigna and a number of other medicare advantage organizations under medicare parts c and d there also continues to be heightened review by federal and state regulators of business and reporting practices within the health service disability and life insurance industries including with respect to claims payment and related escheat practices and increased scrutiny by other state and federal governmental agencies such as state attorneys general empowered to bring criminal actions in circumstances that could have previously given rise only to civil or administrative proceedings 

in addition various governmental agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pharmacy benefit management practices many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other companies agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements we cannot predict what effect if any such governmental investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the industry in general however we may experience government scrutiny and audit activity which may result in the payment or offset of prior reimbursements from the government 

regulatory audits or reviews or actions by other governmental agencies could result in changes to our business practices retroactive adjustments to certain premiums significant fines penalties civil liabilities criminal liabilities or other sanctions including restrictions on our ability to market certain products or engage in businessrelated activities that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity in addition disclosure of an adverse investigation or audit or the imposition of fines or other sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in certain markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services

if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards our business and reputation could be materially and adversely affected 

most of our activities involve the receipt use storage or transmission of a substantial amount of individuals protected health information and personally identifiable information we also use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes and in some cases provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and thirdparty data aggregators and analysts the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with clients in some cases such laws rules regulations and contractual requirements also apply to our vendors and require us to obtain written assurances of their compliance with such requirements or may hold us liable for any violations by our vendors we are also subject to various other consumer protection laws that regulate our communications with customers certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities international laws rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information such as the gdpr are generally more stringent than in the united states and they vary across jurisdictions 

these laws rules and contractual requirements are subject to change compliance with new privacy security and data laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations for example the hitech amendments to hipaa may further restrict our ability to collect disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business 

hipaa requires covered entities to comply with the hipaa privacy security and breach rules in addition business associates must comply with the hipaa security and breach requirements while we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our thirdparty service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain sensitive personal information in order to provide services to these customers hhs has continued its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities and has expanded it to include business associates in addition hhs has increased its enforcement efforts these efforts can result in enforcement actions that are the result of investigations brought on by the notification to hhs of a breach an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance or the implementation of an enforcement action could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows and reputation 

effective prevention detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect us 

federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of customers billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us are complex and subject to change in addition ongoing vigorous law enforcement a highly technical regulatory scheme and the doddfrank act legislation and related regulations enhance regulators enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources failure of our prevention detection or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees could adversely affect our reputation and also expose us to litigation and other proceedings fines and penalties 

in addition provider or customer fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our selfinsured clients further during an economic downturn we may experience increased fraudulent claims volume that may lead to additional costs due to an increase in disputed claims and litigation 

 

significant stock market or interest rate declines could result in additional unfunded pension obligations resulting in the need for additional plan funding by us and increased pension expenses 

we currently have unfunded obligations in our frozen pension plans a significant decline in the value of the plans equity and fixed income investments or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially increase our expenses and change the timing and amount of required plan funding this could reduce the cash available to us including our subsidiaries we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations sustained declines in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the funded status of our pension plans and our reinvestment yield on new investments see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our obligations under the pension plans 

significant changes in market interest rates affect the value of our financial instruments that promise a fixed return or benefit and the value of particular assets and liabilities 

as an insurer we have substantial investment assets that support insurance and contractholder deposit liabilities generally low levels of interest rates on investments such as those experienced in us and foreign financial markets during recent years have negatively impacted our level of investment income earned in recent periods 

a substantial portion of our investment assets are in fixed interestyielding debt securities of varying maturities fixed redeemable preferred securities and commercial mortgage loans the value of these investment assets can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions a rise in interest rates would likely reduce the value of our investment portfolio and increase interest expense if we were to access our available lines of credit

a downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect new sales and retention of current business and a downgrade in our debt ratings would increase the cost of borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to access capital 

financial strength claims paying ability and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are each important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies ratings information by nationally recognized ratings agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe that the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries are important factors in marketing our products to certain customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital each of the rating agencies reviews ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future a downgrade of any of these ratings in the future could make it more difficult to either market our products successfully or raise capital to support business growth within our insurance subsidiaries 

global market economic and geopolitical conditions may cause fluctuations in equity market prices interest rates and credit spreads that could impact our ability to raise or deploy capital and affect our overall liquidity 

if the equity and credit markets experience extreme volatility and disruption there could be downward pressure on stock prices and restricted access to capital for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength extreme disruption in the credit markets could adversely impact our access to and cost of capital in the future 

in the event of adverse economic and industry conditions we may be required to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the funds we have available for other purposes such as investments and other expenditures in ongoing businesses acquisitions dividends and stock repurchases in these circumstances our ability to execute our strategy may be limited our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and market conditions may be reduced or our access to capital markets may be limited such that additional capital may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms 

in connection with the combination with express scripts we have considerably higher levels of indebtedness than cigna and express scripts previously carried which will result in higher relative debt service costs and less cash flow from operations available to fund growth stock repurchases and other corporate purposes during our deleveraging process 

the longterm indebtedness of cigna was approximately 395 billion as of december 31 2018 this level of indebtedness 

• requires us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to debt payments thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies make stock repurchases pay dividends and for general corporate purposes • increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions including increases in interest rates for our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates and are in a greater amount than floating rate assets held or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher and • limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry the covenants to which we have agreed in connection with the financing and our indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio in comparison to that of cigna or express scripts on a recent historical basis may have the effect among other things of restricting our financial and operating flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels during the deleveraging process 

unfavorable developments in economic conditions may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

many factors including geopolitical issues future economic downturns availability and cost of credit and other capital and consumer spending can negatively impact the us and global economies our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on our customers both employers and individuals health care providers pharmacy manufacturers pharmacy providers and thirdparty vendors for example 

• employers may take action to reduce their operating costs by modifying delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products or making changes in the mix of products purchased that are unfavorable to us • higher unemployment rates and workforce reductions could result in lower enrollment in our employerbased plans including an increase in the number of employees who opt out of employerbased plans or our individual plans • because of unfavorable economic conditions or the aca employers may stop offering health care coverage to employees or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employeefunded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs • our historical disability claim experience and industry data indicate that submitted disability claims rise under adverse economic conditions • if clients are not successful in generating sufficient funds or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us • our clients or potential clients may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business

• our clients may be acquired consolidated or otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business or workforce which could reduce the number of customers we serve or otherwise result in lower than anticipated utilization of our services • a prolonged unfavorable economic environment could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other health care providers potentially increasing our medical costs as these providers attempt to maintain revenue levels in their efforts to adjust to their own economic challenges • our thirdparty vendors could significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output to reduce their operating costs our business depends on our ability to perform necessary business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion these factors could lead to a decrease in our customer base revenues or margins andor an increase in our operating costs 

in addition during a prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced or delayed reimbursements or payments in state and federal government programs such as medicare and social security or under contracts with government entities these state and federal budgetary pressures also could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments on us such as premium taxes on insurance companies and hmos and surcharges or fees on select feeforservice and capitated medical claims although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to the credit risk of our reinsurers 

we enter into reinsurance arrangements with other insurance companies primarily to limit losses from large exposures or to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses we also may enter into reinsurance arrangements in connection with acquisition or divestiture transactions when the underwriting company is not being acquired or sold 

under all reinsurance arrangements reinsurers assume insured losses subject to certain limitations or exceptions that may include a loss limit these arrangements also subject us to various obligations representations and warranties with the reinsurers reinsurance does not relieve us of liability as the originating insurer we remain liable to the underlying policyholders if a reinsurer defaults on obligations under the reinsurance arrangement although we regularly evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies reinsurers may become financially unsound if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance contract or if the liabilities exceed any applicable loss limit we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies 

the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors including whether the insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract whether reinsurers or their affiliates have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of the reinsurance contract and the magnitude and type of collateral supporting our reinsurance recoverable such as holding sufficient qualifying assets in trusts or letters of credit issued although a portion of our reinsurance exposures are secured the inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity

shareholders net income increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate income before income taxes was essentially flat reflecting higher adjusted income from operations largely offset by reduced realized investment results and higher special item charges due to transaction costs associated with the express scripts acquisition in 2017 the increase in shareholders net income as compared to 2016 was due to higher adjusted income from operations with special item charges for debt extinguishment costs and charges resulting from us tax reform partially offsetting the increase 

adjusted income from operations increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to earnings growth across all of our segments including contributions from the acquired express scripts business and the lower effective tax rate in 2018 in 2017 the increase in adjusted income from operations compared with 2016 was due to earnings growth across all of our segments 

medical customers increased in both 2018 and 2017 compared with each prior year primarily resulting from growth in the commercial and government segments see the integrated medical segment section for additional discussion 

revenues increased in both 2018 and 2017 primarily due to business growth in the integrated medical and international markets segments in 2018 revenues from the acquired express scripts business of 26 billion also contributed to the increase detailed revenue items are discussed further below 

• premiums increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily reflecting customer growth in integrated medical including contributions from specialty products as well as growth in international markets also contributing to the increase were higher premium rates in our integrated medical segment driven by 1 underlying medical trend 2 suspension of the governments cost share reduction subsidies and 3 resumption of the health insurance industry tax the increase in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily resulted from customer growth in the commercial segment and in international markets partially offset by decreases in government segment premiums due to medicare disenrollment • pharmacy revenues increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily resulting from contributions from the acquired express scripts business see the health services section of this mda for further discussion of pharmacy revenues and costs • fees and other revenues  the increases in both 2018 and 2017 compared with each prior year were primarily attributable to growth in our specialty businesses and an increased customer base for our administrative services only aso business in 2018 contributions from the acquired express scripts business also contributed to the increase • net investment income was higher in 2018 compared with 2017 reflecting growth in average assets and higher yields largely driven by increased partnership income net investment income in 2018 also included 123 million earned from proceeds on the debt issued in september 2018 that is reported as a special item those debt proceeds were used to finance the express scripts acquisition on december 20 2018 in 2017 net investment income increased compared with 2016 driven by growth in average invested assets partially offset by lower yields 

 

• medical costs and other benefit expenses increased in both 2018 and 2017 compared with the prior year reflecting customer growth in integrated medical and international markets as well as medical cost inflation in integrated medical • selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2018 compared with 2017 driven by higher transactionrelated costs associated with the acquisition of express scripts resumption of the health insurance industry tax and volumebased expenses reflecting business growth in 2017 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses compared with 2016 reflected a longterm care guaranty fund assessment and higher volumebased expenses reflecting business growth these increases were offset by suspension of the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and a reduction in costs related to our center for medicare and medicaid services cms audit response • amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily reflecting the impact of the acquired express scripts business the decrease in 2017 compared with 2016 was driven by the expected continuing decline in amortization from our 2012 acquisition of healthspring inc • interest expense and other increased significantly in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to 227 million of interest incurred on debt issued in the third quarter of 2018 prior to the acquisition of express scripts this amount is included in the overall special item for transactionrelated costs net of 123 million of investment income earned on the debt proceeds through the closing date of the transaction • realized investment results declined significantly in 2018 compared with 2017 resulting from lower gains on sales of alternative partnership and fixed maturity investments as well as marktomarket losses on equity securities reported in net income as required by accounting standards update 201601 recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities beginning in 2018 see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in 2017 realized investment results increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher gains on sales of alternative and real estate investments as well as lower impairment losses • the consolidated effective tax rate decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to a lower us tax rate in 2018 partially offset by resumption of the nondeductible health insurance industry tax and the absence of the incremental tax benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2017 for certain transaction costs associated with the terminated merger with anthem in 2017 the effective tax rate was flat compared with 2016 the unfavorable impact of additional tax expense associated with the us tax reform legislation enacted in 2017 was offset by favorable effects of a suspension of the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and an incremental tax benefit from previously nondeductible transactionrelated costs see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

acquisition of express scripts 

as discussed in more detail in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements cigna acquired express scripts on december 20 2018 in a cash and stock transaction valued at 528 billion see the liquidity section of this mda for further discussion of the financing of this transaction 

we incurred a significant amount of costs related to this acquisition both before and after closing these costs are being reported in transactionrelated costs as a special item and excluded from adjusted income from operations the results of express scripts are included in cignas consolidated financial information from the date of the acquisition 

on january 30 2019 anthem exercised its early termination right and terminated the pharmacy benefit management services agreement with us effective march 1 2019 there is a twelvemonth transition period ending march 1 2020 it is expected that the transition of anthems customers will occur at various dates as informed by anthems technology platform migration schedule over the next twelve months we will focus on an effective transition of this relationship and related services over anthems accelerated timeline we exclude the results of express scripts contract with anthem and also coventry from our nongaap reporting metric adjusted income from operations we refer to this adjustment as transitioning clients 

us tax reform legislation

the regulation section of this form 10k provides a detailed description of the patient protection and affordable care act provisions and other legislative initiatives that impact our health care business including regulations issued by cms and the departments of the treasury and health and human services hhs the table presented below provides an update of the impact of these items and other matters affecting our integrated medical and health services segments as of december 31 2018 



 

part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

in 2016 we recorded an allowance for the balance of our risk corridor receivable based on court decisions and the large program deficit during 2018 the us federal circuit court ruled that health insurers are not entitled to receive amounts due under the risk corridor program that have been withheld by congress the plaintiffs have petitioned the us supreme court to review this unfavorable decision as of december 31 2018 we continue to carry this allowance of 109 million based on the current status of court decisions 

risk adjustment balances are subject to audit and adjustment by cms following each program year in february 2018 a federal judge issued a decision invalidating the use of statewide average premium for risk adjustment purposes in response in july 2018 cms issued a final rule clarifying the 2017 program methodology and addressing issues raised in the ruling by the federal judge this rule clears the way for cms to resume risk adjustment collections and payments for the 2017 program year despite this final rule resolution of the legal matter remains uncertain as of december 31 2018 our financial statements reflect the risk adjustment balances for the 2018 and 2017 plan years under the rules currently in effect for the program 

the following table presents our balances associated with the risk adjustment program as of december 31 2018 and 2017 



1 receivables net of allowances are reported in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 2 payables are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities current in the consolidated balance sheets 

aftertax charges for the risk adjustment program were 116 million in 2018 and 105 million in 2017 compared with aftertax benefits of 25 million in 2016 

 



 

we maintain liquidity at two levels the subsidiary level and the parent company level 

liquidity requirements at the subsidiary level generally consist of 

• medical costs pharmacy and other benefit payments • expense requirements primarily for employee compensation and benefits information technology and facilities costs and • income taxes our subsidiaries normally meet their operating requirements by 

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments • using cash flows from operating activities • matching investment durations to those estimated for the related insurance and contractholder liabilities • selling investments and • borrowing from affiliates subject to applicable regulatory limits liquidity requirements at the parent company level generally consist of 

• debt service and dividend payments to shareholders • lending to subsidiaries as needed and • pension plan funding the parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements by 

• maintaining appropriate levels of cash and various types of marketable investments • collecting dividends from its subsidiaries • using proceeds from issuance of debt and common stock and • borrowing from its subsidiaries subject to applicable regulatory limits dividends from our insurance health maintenance organization hmo and foreign subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these restrictions because most of express scripts subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory restrictions on paying dividends acquiring express scripts provides significantly increased financial flexibility to cigna

cash flows for the years ended december 31 were as follows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities consist principally of cash receipts and disbursements for premiums fees pharmacy revenues and costs investment income taxes benefit costs and other expenses 

cash flows from operating activities decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily driven by the timing of settlement of pharmacy payables partially offset by higher net income 

cash flows from operating activities increased slightly in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by higher net income partially offset by lower receipts from medicare part d and medicare advantage programs and a voluntary pension contribution of 150 million in 2017 

investing and financing activities 

our most significant investing and financing activities of 2018 related to acquiring express scripts see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition cigna financed a portion of the acquisition in cash primarily with debt financing as shown above and described more fully in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements with the remaining required cash coming from cash on hand in 2018 cigna also acquired onepath life for approximately 480 million largely with cash held in our foreign operations 

net investment purchases increased in 2018 compared with 2017 largely due to reinvesting our cash flows into fixed income investments the decrease in net investment purchases in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily reflects higher cash used for share repurchases in 2017 

stock repurchases declined in 2018 compared with 2017 as cigna suspended stock repurchase activity to provide liquidity for the express scripts acquisition stock repurchase activity was significantly higher in 2017 than 2016 as stock repurchase activity was suspended for much of 2016 during the pendency of the anthem transaction 

we maintain a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors under this program we may repurchase shares from time to time depending on market conditions and alternate uses of capital the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and alternate uses of capital the share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with rule 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including through rule 10b51 trading plans the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

in 2018 we repurchased 16 million shares for approximately 330 million from january 1 2019 through february 27 2019 we repurchased 19 million shares for approximately 356 million the remaining share repurchase authority as of february 27 2019 was 590 million we repurchased 157 million shares for 28 billion in 2017 and 08 million shares for 110 million in 2016 

 

our capital resources primarily cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities provide protection for policyholders furnish the financial strength to underwrite insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 

our acquisition of express scripts increased our debt and shareholders equity in 2018 as follows 

• stock express scripts shareholders received 02434 of a share of common stock of cigna for every one share of express scripts cigna issued 1376 million additional shares to express scripts shareholders • debt see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the debt issued to finance the acquisition • assumption of express scripts senior notes see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the notes assumed in the acquisition of express scripts at december 31 2018 our debttocapitalization ratio was 509 we expect to deleverage to the upper 30s within 18 to 24 months by using cash flows from operating activities

part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

cigna entered into a new revolving credit agreement and term loan credit agreement in financing the express scripts acquisition a select number of subsidiaries guarantee cigna obligations under the revolving credit agreement and the term loan credit agreement see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these guarantees as well as information on our revolving credit agreement and the term loan credit agreement cigna had 22 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2018 

management guided by regulatory requirements and rating agency capital guidelines determines the amount of capital resources that we maintain management allocates resources to new longterm business commitments when returns considering the risks look promising and when the resources available to support existing business are adequate 

we prioritize our use of capital resources to 

• provide the capital necessary to support growth and maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of subsidiaries and to fund pension obligations • consider acquisitions that are strategically and economically advantageous and • return capital to investors primarily through share repurchases we continue to maintain a capital management strategy to retain overseas a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign operations these undistributed earnings are deployed outside of the united states predominantly in support of the liquidity and regulatory capital requirements of our foreign operations as well as to support growth initiatives overseas this strategy does not materially limit our ability to meet our liquidity and capital needs in the united states 

 

at december 31 2018 there was approximately 42 billion in cash and shortterm investments 12 billion of which was held by the parent or subsidiaries with no regulatory or other restrictions on transferring cash to the parent via dividend or loan in 2019 we expect to generate an additional 62 billion of capital available for deployment including 21 billion of dividends that our regulated insurance companies may pay without prior regulatory approval the parent companys cash obligations in 2019 are expected to approximate 32 billion primarily for repayment of debt interest and anticipated dividends we expect to reissue the 15 billion commercial paper borrowing upon its maturity 

we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations discussed above based on the cash currently available to the parent and current projections for subsidiary dividends and cash flows from the newly acquired express scripts operations in addition we actively monitor our debt obligations and engage in issuance or redemption activities as needed in accordance with our capital management strategy 

our cash projections may not be realized and the demand for funds could exceed available cash if our ongoing businesses experience unexpected shortfalls in earnings or we experience material adverse effects from one or more risks or uncertainties described more fully in the risk factors section of this form 10k in those cases we expect to have the flexibility to satisfy liquidity needs through a variety of measures including intercompany borrowings the parent company can borrow an additional 650 million from its insurance subsidiaries without additional state approval we have additional liquidity available through shortterm commercial paper borrowing capacity and the 325 billion revolving credit agreement discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2018 our unfunded pension liability was 590 million reflecting a decrease of 98 million from december 31 2017 primarily attributable to an increase in discount rates of approximately 75 basis points contributions required in 2019 under the pension protection act of 2006 are immaterial see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 

though we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity significant disruption or volatility in the capital and credit markets could affect our ability to access those markets for additional borrowings or increase costs associated with borrowing funds 

 

we are contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business see the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda beginning on page 48 for additional background on how we manage our liquidity requirements related to these obligations the maturities of our primary contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2018 are estimated to be as follows

• insurance liabilities excluded from the table above are 4 billion of insurance liabilities 3 billion in contractholder deposit funds 1 billion in future policy benefits associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses as well as the reinsured workers compensation personal accident and supplemental benefits businesses as their related net cash flows are not expected to impact our cash flows excluding these amounts the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of 22 billion recorded on the balance sheet because some of the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting charges and fees the timing and amount of actual future cash flows may differ from those presented above • contractholder deposit funds see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy for this liability expected future cash flows presented above also include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees for universal life policies • future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies for these liabilities expected future cash flows for these liabilities presented in the table above are undiscounted the expected future cash flows for guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb reported in future policy benefits do not consider any of the related reinsurance arrangements • longterm debt includes scheduled interest payments capital leases are included in longterm debt and primarily represent obligations for information technology network storage servers and equipment • other noncurrent liabilities include estimated payments for guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib contracts without considering any related reinsurance arrangements pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations supplemental and deferred compensation plans interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and reinsurance liabilities estimated payments of 78 million for deferred compensation nonqualified and international pension plans and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid in less than one year and are included in the table above we expect to make immaterial contributions to the qualified domestic pension plans during 2019 and they are reflected in the above table we expect to make payments subsequent to 2019 for these obligations however subsequent payments have been excluded from the table as their timing is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the liability for uncertain tax positions that could result in future payments was 928 million as of december 31 2018 this amount has been excluded from the table above because we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of such future tax payments see note 18 for additional information on uncertain tax positions 

 

• purchase obligations as of december 31 2018 purchase obligations consisted of estimated payments required under contractual arrangements for future services and investment commitments as follows 



see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our estimated future service commitments primarily represent contracts for certain outsourced business processes and information technology maintenance and support we generally have the ability to terminate these agreements but do not anticipate doing so at this time purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty and those that do not contractually require minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased

part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and • changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition management has discussed how critical accounting estimates are developed and selected with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 

in addition to the estimates presented in the following table there are other accounting estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits as well as estimates with respect to postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions certain compensation accruals and income taxes 

management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition the table below presents the adverse impacts of certain possible changes in assumptions the effect of assumption changes in the opposite direction would be a positive impact to our consolidated results of operations liquidity or financial condition except for assessing impairment of goodwill and fixed maturities carried at a fair value below cost the tax rate used to calculate the aftertax impact of assumption changes is based on the new corporate income tax rate discussed in the key developments section of this mda

the following section of this mda discusses the results of each of our segments as a result of the express scripts acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2018 we changed our segment reporting to reflect the new management and business reporting structure of the combined company prior year financial information has been restated to conform to the new segment presentation see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our segments 

in segment discussions we present adjusted revenues and pretax adjusted income from operations defined as income before taxes excluding realized investment gains losses amortization of acquired intangible assets results of transitioning clients and special items ratios presented in this segment discussion exclude the same items as adjusted income from operations see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these metrics and a reconciliation of income before income taxes to pretax adjusted income from operations 

in these segment discussions we also present pretax adjusted margin defined as adjusted income from operations before taxes divided by adjusted revenues 

see the mda executive overview beginning on page 42 for summarized financial results of each of our reporting segments 

 

the integrated medical segment includes the businesses previously reported in global health care except as follows 1 international health care products are now reported in the international markets segment 2 mail order pharmacy business is now reported in the health services segment and 3 medicare supplement business previously reported in global supplemental benefits is now reported in integrated medical 

the business section of this form 10k see the integrated medical section beginning on page 3 describes the various products and funding solutions offered by this segment including the various revenue sources as described in the introduction to segment reporting above performance of the integrated medical segment is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations key factors affecting profitability for this segment include 

• customer growth • revenues from integrated specialty products including pharmacy services sold to clients and customers across all funding solutions • percentage of medicare advantage customers in plans eligible for quality bonus payments • benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums medical care ratio or mcr for our insured commercial and government businesses and • selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of adjusted revenues expense ratio we adopted new accounting guidance for revenue recognition effective january 1 2018 prior year revenues along with adjusted margin and both the medical care and expense ratios for the integrated medical segment have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to this new basis of accounting see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

results of operations 

 





 

adjusted revenues increased primarily due to customer growth in our commercial and government segments including contributions from specialty products also contributing to the increase were higher premium rates across our businesses reflecting 1 underlying medical cost trend 2 the governments suspension of cost share reduction subsidies and 3 resumption of the health insurance industry tax 

pretax adjusted income from operations increased reflecting improved margins in our individual business and strong ongoing performance in our commercial business including increased contributions from specialty products 

medical care ratio the medical care ratio decreased reflecting the pricing impact of resumption of the health insurance industry tax and improvement from our individual business 

expense ratio the expense ratio increased reflecting resumption of the health insurance industry tax and ongoing investments in growth and innovation partially offset by higher revenues 

 

adjusted revenues increased primarily due to customer growth in our commercial risk and individual businesses partially offset by lower customer enrollment in our medicare advantage business 

pretax adjusted income from operations increased reflecting higher earnings in both our commercial and government operating segments the increase in the commercial segment reflects customer growth including increased contributions from our specialty products the government segments earnings growth reflects lower operating expenses related to the moratorium of the health insurance industry tax in 2017 and our 2016 cms audit response as well as favorable claims experience in our individual business partially offset by lower customer enrollment in our medicare advantage business pretax adjusted income from operations included favorable prior year reserve development of 148 million for 2017 prior year reserve development in 2016 was not material

unpaid claims and claim expenses 

unpaid claims and claim expenses were higher as of december 31 2018 compared with 2017 and were higher as of december 31 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to customer growth and medical cost trend see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

medical customers 

a medical customer is defined as a person meeting any one of the following criteria 

• is covered under a medical insurance policy managed care arrangement or service agreement issued by us • has access to our provider network for covered services under their medical plan or • has medical claims that are administered by us medical customers now include the medicare supplement business for the integrated medical segment medical customers excludes international health care customers 

our medical customer base was higher at december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017 primarily reflecting growth across our targeted commercial markets as well as our government segment businesses our medical customer base increased as of december 31 2017 compared with 2016 reflecting growth across our commercial and government segments the government segment growth was primarily driven by our medicare supplement and individual businesses partially offset by declines in our medicare advantage business 

 

we established the health services segment to include the pharmacy benefit management pbm and health services operations of express scripts effective with the acquisition as well as cignas legacy mail order pharmacy business as described in the introduction to segment reporting on page 56 performance of the health services segment is measured using pretax adjusted income from operations 

the key factors that impact health services revenues and costs of revenues are volume mix and price these key factors are discussed further below see note 2 for additional information on revenue and cost recognition policies for this segment 

• as our clients claim volumes increase or decrease our resulting revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly increase or decrease our gross profit could also increase or decrease as a result of changes in purchasing discounts • the mix of claims generally considers the type of drug and distribution method used for dispensing and fulfilling as our mix of drugs changes our resulting pharmacy revenues and cost of revenues correspondingly may increase or decrease the primary driver of fluctuations within our mix of claims is the generic fill rate generally higher generic fill rates reduce revenues as generic drugs are typically priced lower than the branded drugs they replace however as ingredient cost paid to pharmacies on generic drugs is incrementally lower than the price charged to our clients higher generic fill rates generally have a favorable impact on our gross profit the home delivery generic fill rate is currently lower than the network generic fill rate as fewer generic substitutions are available among maintenance medications such as therapies for chronic conditions commonly dispensed from home delivery pharmacies as compared to acute medications that are primarily dispensed by pharmacies in our retail networks • our contract pricing is impacted by our ability to negotiate contracts for pharmacy network pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing and manufacturer rebates we are able to reduce the rate of drug price increases and in some cases lower our clients prescription drug spend through our integrated set of solutions including sharing of significant amounts of pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates with our clients we refer to this as management of the supply chain inflation also impacts our pricing because most of our contracts provide that we bill clients and pay pharmacies based on a generally recognized price index for pharmaceuticals therefore the rate of inflation for prescription drugs and our efforts to manage this inflation for our clients can affect our revenues and cost of revenues in this mda we present revenues gross profit and pretax adjusted income from operations excluding transitioning clients in addition to those metrics including transitioning clients see the key transactions and developments section on page 46 of this mda for further discussion of transitioning clients and why we present this information

the following table presents our invested asset portfolio excluding separate account assets as of december 31 2018 and 2017 additional information regarding our investment assets and related accounting policies is included in notes 2 9 10 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements 



 

investments in fixed maturities include publicly traded and privately placed debt securities mortgage and other assetbacked securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on our balance sheet additional information regarding valuation methodologies key inputs and controls is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements more detailed information about fixed maturities by type of issuer and maturity dates is included in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

the following table reflects our fixed maturity portfolio by type of issuer as of december 31 2018 and 2017 



the fixed maturity portfolio decreased during 2018 reflecting decreased valuations due to increases in market yields and weakening foreign currencies partially offset by increased investment in fixed maturities as of december 31 2018 206 billion or 90 of the fixed maturities in our investment portfolio were investment grade baa and above or equivalent and the remaining 23 billion were below investment grade the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the noninvestment grade spectrum these quality characteristics have not materially changed from the prior year and are consistent with our investment strategy fixed maturity investments are diversified by issuer geography and industry as appropriate 

foreign government obligations are concentrated in asia primarily south korea consistent with our risk management practice and local regulatory requirements of our international business operations corporate fixed maturities include private placement assets of 6 billion

these investments are generally less marketable than publiclytraded bonds however yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publiclytraded bonds with comparable credit risk we perform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions if warranted 

in addition to amounts classified in fixed maturities on our consolidated balance sheets we participate in an insurance joint venture in china in which we have a 50 ownership interest we account for this joint venture on the equity basis of accounting and report it in other assets this entity had an investment portfolio of approximately 63 billion supporting this business that is primarily invested in chinese corporate and government fixed maturities there were no investments with a material unrealized loss as of december 31 2018 

 

our commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans diversified by property type location and borrower loans are secured by high quality commercial properties and are generally made at less than 70 of the propertys value at origination of the loan property value debt service coverage quality building tenancy and stability of cash flows are all important financial underwriting considerations we hold no direct residential mortgage loans and do not originate or service securitized mortgage loans 

commercial real estate capital markets remain very active for wellleased quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional investment markets the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages in our mortgage loan portfolio possess these characteristics 

as of december 31 2018 the 19 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 66 loans that are all in good standing given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment generally ranging between 30 and 40 we remain confident that borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms 

 

other longterm investments of 19 billion included investments in securities limited partnerships and real estate limited partnerships as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures these entities typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies securities partnerships and equity real estate given our subordinate position in the capital structure of these underlying entities we assume a higher level of risk for higher expected returns to mitigate risk these investments are diversified across approximately 135 separate partnerships and approximately 70 general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships also the underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type and geographic region no single partnership investment exceeded 4 of our securities and real estate partnership portfolio 

 

problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by 60 days or more or have been restructured as to terms including concessions by us for modification of interest rate principal payment or maturity date potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current no payment is more than 59 days past due but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 

there were no significant problem or potential problem investments at december 31 2018 and 2017 

 

despite the continued strength of the us economy concerns related to trade and tariffs and rising interest rates contributed to a return of financial market volatility and public equity market declines in 2018 we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions and trends including the uncertainty caused by the united kingdoms decision to exit the european union and their potential impact to our investment portfolio certain sectors such as retail energy and natural gas have been volatile and we expect that to continue future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market conditions that exist when a transaction occurs or at the reporting date these future conditions are not reasonably predictable however we believe that the vast majority of our investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms based on our strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities we expect to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term although future impairment losses resulting from interest rate movements and credit deterioration due to both investmentspecific and the global economic uncertainties discussed above remain possible we do not expect these losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity 

 

 

our assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices consistent with disclosure requirements the following items have been excluded from this consideration of market risk for financial instruments 

• changes in the fair values of insurancerelated assets and liabilities because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk • changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets and • changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill deferred policy acquisition costs taxes and various accrued liabilities because they are not financial instruments their primary risks are other than market risk

part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

excluding these items our primary market risk exposures from financial instruments are 

• interestrate risk on fixedrate mediumterm instruments changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return • foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the south korean won euro new zealand dollar chinese yuan renminbi and taiwan dollar an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 

 

we predominantly rely on three techniques to manage our exposure to market risk 

• investmentliability matching we generally select investment assets with characteristics such as duration yield currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of our related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that we can match the investments to our obligations shorterterm investments generally support shorterterm life and health liabilities mediumterm fixedrate investments support interestsensitive and health liabilities longerterm investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and longterm disability liabilities • use of local currencies for foreign operations we generally conduct our international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies this technique limits exchange rate risk to our net assets • use of derivatives we use derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments 

 

assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates and 10 strengthening in the us dollar to foreign currencies the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities would have been as follows as of december 31 



the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates primarily on fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models primarily duration modeling the impact of a hypothetical increase to interest rates at december 31 2018 is consistent with the impact at december 31 2017 which has been restated to exclude longterm debt as discussed below 

in the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates the fair value of the companys longterm debt would decrease approximately 24 billion at december 31 2018 and 05 billion at december 31 2017 the impact at december 31 2018 was greater than that at december 31 2017 due to additional longterm debt issued in acquiring express scripts changes in the fair value of our longterm debt do not impact our financial position or operating results see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the companys debt 

the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of certain financial instruments held by us was estimated to be 10 of the us dollar equivalent fair value our foreign operations hold investment assets such as fixed maturities cash and cash equivalents that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities the effect of a hypothetical 10 strengthening in the us dollar to foreign currencies at december 31 2018 is consistent with that at december 31 2017
