the following description of our busin ess should be read in conjunction with item 7 in this form 10k including the information contained therein under the heading business overview 

description of business by segment 

our company is organized into two segments new equipment and service which for the year ended december 31 2021 contributed 45 and 55 of our net sales and 21 and 79 of our segment operating profit respectively our international operations represented approximately 74 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 

new equipment 

through our new equipment segment we design manufacture sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential commercial and infrastructure projects in 2021  our new equipment segment had sales of 64 billion and operating profit of 459 million in 2021 our new equipment sales in china and the americas each represented approximately onethird of our new equipment net sales respectively while china represented over half of our global new equipment unit volume 

we have developed a range of elevator and escalator solutions to meet the varying needs and objectives of our diverse customers our primary elevator and escalator solutions are described below 

the gen2 family of elevators has been our principal lowand midrise elevator solution since its launch in 2000 otis has sold over one million gen2 units making it our best selling elevator platform in 2021 we introduced the successors to the gen2 family of elevators the gen3 and gen360 digital elevator platforms these platforms enhance the spacesaving energyefficient design of the gen2 elevator with the connectivity of the otis one iot internet of things digital service platform while adding additional safety features for the passengers and our colleagues who maintain the elevator otis one is designed 

to continuously monitor equipment health and performance in real time to provide proactive predictive and transparent information to our technicians and customers the technology expands predictive and remote maintenance capabilities to support improved elevator uptime and service productivity 

the gen360 elevator also features a new native electronic architecture with many mechanical components replaced by electronic components that in connection with our service increase reliability reduce the potential for entrapments and free hoistway space to accommodate larger cabins the new otis one iot solution turns the elevator into a network of sensors for realtime status updates a foldable inceiling platform allows maintenance operations to be performed safely from within the car rather than on top of it and depending on local regulations eliminates the need for a refuge space above the car and the protrusion on the roof for a flat roof design with 360degree cameras in the hoistway otis service teams can visually confirm finetune diagnose and solve many issues remotely without stopping the elevator 

for taller highrise buildings our most prominent product is the skyrise elevator solution the skyrise advanced highrise elevator platform combines cuttingedge technologies and precision engineering to deliver solutions for residential commercial and mixed use skyscrapers 

otis offers a range of technologies for improving the passenger experience as well as the safety and efficiency of the building itself our proprietary compass 360 destination management system groups passengers by their desired destination and directs them to an assigned car that minimizes waiting and ride time the systems algorithms anticipate traffic demand within a building and improves traffic flow otis eview incar display streams live customizable infotainment to passengers and connects them to otisline during an emergency the otis ecall plus smartphone app enables passengers to summon their elevator remotely for a touchless experience we have also rolled out new voice and gesturing technologies for summoning elevators to customers in china and north america with other geographies to follow and the new otis cab air purifier significantly reduces airborne bacteria and viruses another innovation designed to address customer needs and passenger preferences as the result of the covid19 pandemic 

in addition t o elevator solutions we also offer escalators and moving walkways with a range of finishes and aesthetics otis escalators integrate easily with building designs our smart design and features enhance sustainability and passenger safety such as sensorequipped escalators and moving walkways that efficiently run only when passengers approach or operate at reduced speeds to conserve energy when there are no riders 

our new equipment customers include realestate and building developers and general contractors who develop andor design buildings for residential commercial retail or mixeduse activity we also sell new equipment to government agencies particularly to support infrastructure projects such as airports railways or metros we generally sell directly to our customers through our new equipment sales personnel due to the large and widespread nature of the customer base in china and certain other geographies our direct sales force is augmented by agents and distributors we also rely on agents and distributors to sell our new equipment in certain other countries and territories given the breadth of our customer base and the large number of customers to whom we deliver new equipment on an annual basis we are not dependent on any single customer and do not have any contracts material to otis as a whole with any single customer our network of agents and distributors is broad and geographically dispersed and we do not rely on or have any contracts material to otis as a whole with any single agent or distributor 

new equipment customers typically engage with us at an early stage during the construction cycle the timing of order placement depends on factors including project complexity and customer requirements elevator installation usually occurs midway through building construction 

most new equipment orders are delivered w ithin 12 months of booking though larger projects can take longer to deliver based on customer construction schedules when placing new equipment orders customers typically make an advance payment to cover costs including design and contract engineering these advance payments are typically followed by periodic progress payments at specified milestones such as delivery of materials at the job site and completion of installation and equipment commissioning installation is carried out by our installation technicians or through subcontractors in which case we typically complete the final inspection and commissioning to ensure that our quality standards are met revenues are recognized based on percentage of completion once commissioned new equipment units are typically supported by a warranty for a limited period of time 

service 

through our service segment we perform maintenance and repair services as well as modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators we have a maintenance portfolio of over 21 million units globally which includes otis equipment manufactured and sold by us as well as equipment from other original equipment manufacturers through our network of service sales personnel we sell our services directly to customers in all significant elevator and escalator endsegments around the world in 2021  our service segment had net sales of 79 billion and operating profit of 18 billion 

service customers typically comprise building owners facility managers housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed customers securing services for elevators are frequently different from those who initially make purchasing decisions with respect to new equipment solutions with over 21 million maintenance units under contract globally we have a wide range of customers in our service segment and do not have any single service contract material to otis as a whole contract duration depends on a number of factors including customer needs regulatory requirements and industrygeography dynamics we work closely with our customers to renew these contracts as appropriate certain types of customers such as those owning or operating large properties or portfolios of properties tend to execute longterm maintenance agreements 

we grow our maintenance portfolio through conversion of newly installed units into maintenance contracts through prospecting and winning units already in service from customers using another service provider and through acquisitions our service sales personnel seek to win service contracts upon the expiration or termination of existing service contracts from customers by offering a superior value proposition through service excellence an engaged and technically sophisticated group of field service technicians a streamlined customer experience and strong elevator and escalator operating performance 

our services include inspections preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs a basic maintenance contract provides for inspection consistent with local regulatory needs we also provide customers with repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear as well as breakdowns we offer incremental tiered maintenance and service offerings with varying levels of coverage up to and including comprehensive component replacement coverage 

similar to most other electromechanical equipment elevators and escalators are subject to wear and tear which over time erodes equipment functionality as elevator equipment ages we work with customers to help renew or refresh their elevators with modernization solutions that enhance equipment operation and improve building functionality modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and subsystems 

we provide our service offerings to our customers through a global network of approximately 34000 service mechanics operating out of over 1400 branches and offices typically located in close proximity to concentrations of customers our mechanics are critical to our ability to deliver a high level of service to our customers our otisline operations provide personalized customer support 247 they receive customer service requests and assign and dispatch field technicians as necessary to respond to service requests our network of service parts centers repair centers and obsolescence management capabilities are key enablers to supporting customers by keeping their elevators and escalators in good working condition 

digital technology initiatives 

otis has been using technology to monitor elevator performance remotely for decades culminating in our latest otis one technology discussed under new equipment above we also offer multimedia subscription options with additional voice data and video digital services to customers leveraging our iot technologies by the end of 2021 approximately 35 of our global portfolio is connected in 2022 we expect to continue to innovate and expand our digital ecosystem and suite of digital solutions for both our existing service portfolio customers and for new equipment shipments from our factories 

research and development  intellectual property 

innovation is a fundamental characteristic of our history and is central to our strategy for the year ended december 31 2021 research and development rd expense was 159 million and 11 as a percentage of net sales in addition to research and development expense we made investments in digital and strategic initiatives of approximately 59 million which in combination with research and development expense was 15 as a percentage of net sales we coordinate our rd efforts globally through an operating model that sets global and local priorities based on customer and segment needs we have 11 rd centers and 18 factories around the world including major locations in china india france spain and the united states the rd centers are strategically located close to concentrations of customers and factories to enable efficient development of engineering solutions that can serve a s global model products and adapt quickly and efficiently to local customer needs and local demographic and construction trends we have approximate ly 1300 e ngineers globally with increasing focus on digital initiatives software design of the user interface and the user experience 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to the otis business to protect our rd investments in products and services we currently own approximately 3700 globally issued patents and we have approximately 2700 patent applications pending globally of which approximately 2600 applicatio ns were filed in the last three years our patents are primarily filed in europe the united states and asia we believe that our patents and trade secrets create a competitive advantage and that we have taken reasonable measures to build a portfolio of valid and enforceable intellectual property rights however these intellectual property rights might be challenged and could be found invalid or unenforceable loss of strategic patents and trade secrets could significantly affect our competitiveness see item 1a in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

joint ventures and nonwholly owned subsidiaries 

our international strategic relationships joint ventures and nonwholly owned subsidiaries are an important part of our business as they support our access to international markets and customers results of these entities are consolidated with our financial and operational results in addition to china and spain as discussed below we also operate through joint ventures and nonwholly owned subsidiaries in other countries including italy russia malaysia and certain countries in the middle east 

china 

we operate in china through two principal joint ventures otis elevator china investment company limited “otis china” and otis electric elevator company limited “otis electric” otis china is a joint venture established in 1998 for the purpose of manufacturing installing and servicing elevators escalators and related equipment we are a majority owner of otis china and tianjin tai kang investment co ltd “tianjin tai kang” is our joint venture partner otis electric a subsidiary of otis china is a joint venture established in 1997 for the purpose of manufacturing installing and servicing elevators escalators and related equipment otis china owns a controlling equity stake in otis electric otis china’s partner in otis electric is xizi elevator group co 

zardoya otis 

we conduct our operations based in spain through zardoya otis sa “zardoya otis” which manufactures installs and services elevators and elevator equipment in spain and exports elevator equipment it manufactures for installation by certain of our subsidiaries outside of spain zardoya otis’ shares are listed on spanish stock exchanges and the company is subject to the supervision of the spanish securities exchange commission comisión nacional del mercado de valores the cnmv we own a majority equity stake in zardoya otis with euro syns sa owning a minority position and the remaining shares being held by public shareholders 

in september 2021 the company announced a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of zardoya otis not owned by otis see item 1a and note 1 business overview in item 8 in this form 10k for further details regarding this pending transaction including risks associated therewith 

competition 

we operate in a global and highly competitive industry due to the global and localized nature of the industry there are numerous pa rticipants of varying size that operate in our industry according to industry estimates there are hundreds of participants that offer new equipment solutions and several thousand participants that offer maintenance and service solutions in both the ne w equipment and service segments major competitors globally include kone oyj schindler group and tk elevator while there are a number of additional competitors in the asia pacific region competitive dynamics vary significantly by segment and geogr aphy in the service segment independent service providers and other small operators are significant competitors in most of our local geograph ies these independent service providers have an aggregate portfolio of about 50 of service units but account for a smaller percentage of the service business when measured by value because of the types of units and level of maintenance covered by these providers 

there are several factors that determine competitiveness in the industry including local codes and compliance requirements customer preferences price reputation delivery and execution product quality equipment performance reliability and longterm service and product support our success in both our new equipment and service segments depends upon our ability to develop and market our products services and solutions as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficien cy we believe our global presence local relationships and proven track record in executing complex elevator and escalator solutions contribute to our iconic brand reputation and competitive position in the industry we believe our business strategies sustain new equipment growth accelerate service portfolio growth advance the digitalization of otis focus and empower the organization support our ability to successfully compete across the new equipment and service segments and will help deliver sustainable earnings growth 

compliance with government regulations 

we conduct our business through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide any changes in legislation or government policies impacting our industry including with respect to employee safety laborrelated regulations industrial equipment licensing requirements foreign ownership limitations and building and elevator safety codes can affect our operations we closely monitor local legislation and government policies in the locations in which we operate 

in addition our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulations promulgated by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes and regulations for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of otis and its affiliates as do those of other countries pertaining to similar matters 

for further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations see in this form 10k item 1a item 7 and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 22 contingent liabilities in item 8 in this form 10k 

seasonality 

our business and operating results are generally not subject to significant fluctuations as a result of seasonality although we have experienced lower new equipment sales in asia in the first calendar quarter coinciding with lunar new year celebrations in addition we have also experienced lower new equipment sales in the fourth quarter in china due to a national holiday that occurs during the first week of october which may impact the relative mix of sales within the quarter 

raw materials and supplies 

due to the global and distributed nature of our operations we partner with a diverse network of several thousand suppliers globally these include product and nonproduct suppliers as well as subcontractors we rely on approximately 500 key s uppliers for our manufacturing supply chain 

components and systems necessary to effectively complete our new equipment projects as well as to satisfy our maintenance and repair obligations are often available from two or more sources within the industry while we believe no single supplier is material to our business some components or applications require particular specifications or qualifications in those cases there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components which have in the past and could in the future result in supply constraints or cost pressures due to an issue with such a supplier including financial or operational difficulties or a contract dispute additionally the slowdown of economic activity due to covid19 and subsequent ongoing recovery in certain regions as well as the impact of covid19 more broadly on employment and the economy have created long lead times and product shortages for certain components and supplier we implemented mitigation actions to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including the use of safety stock and alternative materials as well as risk assessments qualification of multiple supply sources and use of long term supplier agreements 

although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our business have caused margin and cost pressures for our business including in connection with the impact of covid19and the ongoing recovery we do not expect nearterm unavailability or pricing of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our business we seek to manage commodity price risk through locking and hedging strategies as well as passing the increases onto our customers through pricing see item 1a in this form 10k for risks associated with raw material and supply chain as well as covid19 

environmental social and governance esg 

otis is committed to working for the global good of our passengers customers colleagues and society in order to align our esg initiatives with our broader strategy we completed a materiality assessment in 2020 to determine our most critical esg areas for management goalsetting and reporting this allows us to focus on the topics most important to our business we also became a signatory to the un global compact in march 2021 our esg goals and alignment to un sustainable development goals are categorized into four areas health  safety environmental  impact people  communities and governance  accountability 

we have published our esg goals which can be found in the investor section of our corporate website additionally we expect to publish an esg report on our es g activities metrics and progress towards our goals starting in 2022 in 2022 our progress towards reducing scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gases will be a factor in determining payouts under our executive shortterm incentive plan our esg goals and esg report are not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and will be available in the investors section of our website httpwwwotiscom under the heading esg also see human capital below for additional information regarding certain esg initiatives related to our colleagues including health  safety employee engagement and diversity equity and inclusion 

there have been no and we do not expect there to be in the near term material impacts on our business financial condition or results of operations as a result of compliance with legislation or regulatory rules regarding climate change from the known physical eff ects of climate change or as a result of implementing our esg initiatives increased regulation and other climate change concerns however could subject us to additional costs and restrictions and we are not able to predict how su ch regulations or concerns would affect our business operations or financial results 

human capital 

as of december 31 2021 our global workforce consists of approximately 70000 colleagues with 42  in asia 35  in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 22  in the americas 

approximately 63 of our workforce in the us is covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us our colleagues are represented by workers councils or statutory labor unions as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions  while we strive to maintain good relationships with our employee representative bodies our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force t he collective bargaining agreement for most of our bargaining unit colleagues in the us was renewed without disruption in july 2017 and is 

set to expire in july 2022 although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of this co ntract will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows financial condition or results of operations for a discussion of employmentrelated matters see item 1a in this form 10k 

compensation 

our colleagues are vital to our success and we offer pay and benefits designed to attract retain and motivate our colleagues and align their compensation with both individual and our overall performance while our programs vary by location and based on the roles of our colleagues they include competitive base pay shortterm incentive bonuses longterm incentive pay in the form of stock awards retirement plans health care and insurance benefits paid time off tuition assistance through our employee scholar program family leave dependent care and employee assistance programs 

safety and health 

safety is one of the otis absolutes for that reason safety measures and indicators are regularly monitored by management and reported to our board of directors to promote safety we have a health and safety management system and regularly measure the effectiveness of our health and safety programs we empower all of our colleagues and subcontractors with stop work authority if they perceive an unsafe condition or a behavior that may cause injury we also seek to promote a culture where stop work authority can be freely exercised without the fear of retribution or retaliation and a learning culture to enhance the quality and delivery of safety and technical training 

for our colleagues to be effective they need to be healthy starting in 2020 with the added stress of the covid19 pandemic we increased our efforts to improve our colleagues’ mental health by expanding employee assistance plan benefits and by bringing increased attention to the importance of mental health we believe this is an important initiative to continue and we are striving to provide employee assistance plan benefits to all of our colleagues by the end of 2022 during 2020 and 2021 we covered the cost of covid19 testing and treatment for our us based colleagues and their covered family members under our welfare plans we have where possible also offered remote work flexibility for our colleagues 

training and development 

we strive to emphasize development and training as we believe that individual and corporate success is driven by lifelong learning and by empowering our colleagues as a result we provide a range of development and mentoring opportunities that vary based on a colleagues career stage and function one of our flagship programs is “otis university” a global program that builds leadership and functional capabilities in sales field engineering operations and major projects we are very proud of our “employee scholar program” which is a comprehensive companysponsored education program that allows colleagues to expand their skills through degree or certification programs since the programs inception in 1997 otis as a business unit of utc and following the separation has supported otis colleagues in receiving more than 5500 degrees across 60 countries through an investment of over 95 million in the employee scholar program 

ensuring that we have access to trained technicians is very important to our business our mechanics receive extensive training to service and install equipment safely this training which is provided by otis and our unions consists of live virtual and onthejob modules with experienced mechanics to help us attract talent and provide us with a pipeline of trained mechanics in china we have partnered with five technology schools in the country to offer the otis technology academy the students in the technology schools are provided with technical training certifications handson access to our equipment and an otis apprenticeship period we are also increasing the number of women in our mechanic population across the world in order to enhance diversity and to obtain access to a larger talent pool 

commitment to change 

we aim to be an equalopportunity employer of choice for people of broad perspectives and experiences cultures genders races and generations we want to be a business whose workforce mirrors the diversity of our customers and the communities where we live and work and a place where every voice feels safe welcomed and heard to help us achieve these objectives we 

• conducted an independent review of our company to uncover and eliminate biases affecting any colleagues in our hiring compensation professional development and other business practices 

• accelerated antiracism unconscious bias and inclusion learning for colleagues at all levels of the organization and throughout their otis careers

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our business 

we may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions in general and conditions in the construction and infrastructure industries in particular 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks including global credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence commodity prices raw material and energy costs supply chain issues foreign currency exchange rates interest rates labor costs levels of government spending and deficits trade policies tariffs and trade barriers political conditions regulatory changes fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity pandemic health issues see discussion of covid19 below natural disasters actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy these economic and political conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways in particular a slowdown in building and remodeling activity or decreased public spending on infrastructure projects could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business may be further impacted by the covid19 pandemi c 

covid19 including variants of the original virus has continued to spread throughout the world resulting in prolonged travel restrictions and shutdowns occupancy limits or other restrictions of nonessential businesses including construction and hospitality venues impacting to various extents our factory operations new equipmen t installations and access to units under maintenance the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business is uncertain at this time and will depend on future developments including the availability efficacy and distribution of various vaccines and treatments for covid19 but further prolonged restrictions or the rollback of reopening measures due to higher infection rates may further disrupt our operati ons and the operations of our suppliers distributors and customers covid19 has adversely affected and could further affect the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services and to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations which has resulted in and could further result in a decrease andor cancellation of orders for our products and services andor payment delays or defaults similarly covid19 and the ongoing economic recovery from the virus have adversely affected and may further affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience production constraints distribution challenges financial distress or bankruptcy which could impact our ability to fulfill orders on time or at anticipated cost additionally governments including in the us have enacted or may enact vaccine mandates while the us supreme court has recently blocked enforcement of one mandate other mandates remain in effect and uncertainty remains around whether additional mandates may be adopted in the future such mandates could result in labor disruptions employee attrition difficulty securing future labor needs and loss of government contracts furthermore it is unclear what longer term effects the virus will have on the global economy including the commercial building industry any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in local and regional economic conditions such as fluctuations in exchange rates risks associated with government policies on international trade and investments and risks associated with china and other emerging markets 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approxim ately 74 of our 2021 net sales derived from international operations changes in local and regional economic conditions including credit conditions and fluctu ations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay for the materials used in our products though we engage in hedging strategies to manage foreign currency exposures in connection with certain crossborder transactions our operating margins may be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations that result in higher costs or lower revenues for certain crossborder transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to investments and limitations on foreign ownership of businesses taxation foreign exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and the repatriation of earnings government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas capital controls punitive taxes or tariffs or similar trade barriers whether imposed by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or services or encumber our ability to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements with the us or countries where we sell large quantities of products and services procure materials incorporated into our products manufacture products or recruit and employ employees including trade relations between the us and china as discussed below could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including our ability to r ecruit and retain employees or deploy certain employees to the geographies where their skills are best utilized our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign nations’ priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries 

china is currently the largest end market for sales of new equipment in our industry with our new equipment sales in china representing approximately 35 of our global new equipment net sales and over half of our global new equipment unit volume  changes to market and economic conditions in china including credit conditions for our customers or an escalation of trade conflicts between the us and china may impact our ability to continue new equipment net sales in china at rates consistent with prior years furthermore as is the case in many countries where we operate the legal and regulatory regime in china is evolving and accordingly we could in the future be required to comply with significant requirements unique to china in order to maintain access to chinese markets 

we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as those and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products and services a slowdown in urbanization in emerging countries such as china or india could adversely affect our financial performance in addition as part of our global business model we operate in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia malaysia mexico poland russia south africa ukraine turkey and certain countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk our emerging market operations can present many risks including differences in culturally accepted practices such as employment and business practices compliance risks economic and government instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of foreign exchange and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and thirdparty manufacturing services in our business and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including thirdparty manufacturers and commodity markets to secure the raw materials and components used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials issues with suppliers such as a disruption in deliveries capacity constraints production disruptions quality issues and supplier closings or bankruptcies including in connection with the impact of covid19 and the ongoing economic recovery price increases or 

decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers could damage our reputation or could increase our operating costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance or purchasing patterns of key distributors and agents could adversely affect us 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to distributors and agents particularly in china that have valuable relationships with customers some of these distributors and agents also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns or compliance practices could adversely affect our reputation competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we design manufacture install and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to grow our business through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements such as the development and execution of advanced digital technologies for the benefit of our new equipment or service segment or the development of new products depend on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies validation of innovative technologies and customer interest in new technologies and products and acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop 

our research and development efforts may not result in innovative products or services that incorporate new technologies for our new equipment and service segments or products or services being developed on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as effectively as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or services or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or divert resources from other projects if we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new products services and technologies our competitors may develop competing technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products or services the possibility also exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we operate in a competitive environment and our profitability depends on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services 

our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our quotations and bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a new equipment order or the extent of required maintenance pursuant to a service contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform in accordance with the contract as a result of these and other factors we may not be able to provide products and services at competitive prices while maintaining anticipated levels of profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences we may need additional debt or equity financing in the future to meet our capital needs and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all due to changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

as of december 31 2021 we had 72 billion outstanding longterm debt our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including among others 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and reinvestment in our businesses and 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions 

we may need additional financing for general corporate purposes for example we may need funds to increase our investment in research and development activities to refinance or repay existing debt or to make a strategic acquisition we may be unable to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all volatility in the world financial markets including as a result of inflation concerns from the ongoing recovery from the covid19 pandemic could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets our ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or services or in the solvency of our customers suppliers or distributors or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions 

otis has an investment grade credit rating from each of moody’s investor services inc and standard  poor’s there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or similar announcement could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts or otherwise have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to the capital markets 

if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants or rating agencies may downgrade our credit rating

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth our due diligence reviews in connection with our acquisitions may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as anticorruption antitrust anticollusion environmental or income tax laws we also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges as well as expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we may incur unexpected costs associated with labor law tax or pension matters or to bring acquired assets up to our operating standards we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations applying our internal controls to these acquired businesses or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses 

we also make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees other financial arrangements continued supply and services arrangements and environmental and product liability claims following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition

as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses or changes to business operations that could impact our ability to sell our products and services or sell them at expected profit levels uncertainty relating to those laws or regulations may also affect how we operate structure our investments and enforce our rights 

product and general liability claims including claims related to the safety reliability or maintenance of our products and accident risks during the production installation maintenance and use of our products can result in significant costs including settlements punitive damages and other risks such as damage to our reputation negative publicity and management distraction which could reduce demand for our products and services 

in addition we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa applies to companies individual directors officers employees and agents under certain anticorruption laws companies also may be held liable for the actions of partners or representatives certain of our customer relationships are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other anticorruption laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to seek to ensure lawful conduct which include training and internal controls we may not always be able to prevent our employees partners joint ventures agents or distributors from violating the fcpa or other anticorruption laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement changes or enhancements to our compliance measures that could increase our costs decrease our access to certain sales channels personnel changes or other remedial actions prior to the separation utc including otis was subject to a formal investigation by the sec related to alleged violations of anticorruption laws which resulted in a settlement order in which our former parent utc paid a civil penalty related to certain activities in our business in russia china and kuwait as well as activities in another utc business

our business and financial performance depend on continued substantial investment in information technology infrastructure which may not yield anticipated benefits and may be adversely affected by cyberattacks on information technology infrastructure and products and other business disruptions 

the efficient operation of our business will require continued substantial investment in technology infrastructure systems including partial shifting from virtual private networks to cloudbased networks and we must attract and retain qualified people to operate these systems expand and improve them integrate new systems effectively and efficiently convert to new systems when required an inability to fund acquire and implement these systems might impact our ability to respond effectively to changing customer expectations manage our business scale our solutions effectively or impact our customer service levels which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our financial results repeated or prolonged interruptions of service due to problems with our systems or thirdparty technologies whether or not in our control could have a significant negative impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services furthermore we are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business failure to design develop and implement new technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to adequately invest in and maintain these systems could result in the diversion of management’s attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results competitive position and ability to efficiently manage our business our existing information systems may become obsolete requiring us to transition our systems to a new platform such a transition would be time consuming costly and damaging to our competitive position and could require additional management resources failure to implement and deploy new systems or replacement systems on the schedules anticipated could materially adversely affect our operating results 

in addition our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or thirdparty information technology “it” infrastructure which could result from among other causes cyberattacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature cyberbased risks in particular are evolving and include attacks on our it infrastructure as well as attacks targeting the security integrity andor availability of the hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure such attacks could disrupt our business operations our systems or those of third parties and could impact the ability of our products to work as intended we have experienced cyberbased attacks and due to the evolving threat landscape may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency we continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection detection response and recovery capabilities and to mitigate potential risks to our technology products services and operations from potential cyberattacks however given the unpredictability nature and scope of cyberattacks it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period as a result of a cyberattack we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers destruction or corruption of data security breaches manipulation or improper use of our or thirdparty systems networks or products financial losses from remedial actions loss of business potential liability penalties fines andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition due to the evolving nature of such risks the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted any disruption to our business due to such issues or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated could have an adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

there can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales ordering supplies delivering products providing functional products and otherwise conducting our business 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers suppliers and distributors infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements customer and supplier agreements license agreements information technology security systems internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights also may be limited in addition we may be the target of competitor or other thirdparty patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products or services our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of and ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services any of these events or factors could subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various international jurisdictions changes to tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations or other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities in addition governmental authorities in various jurisdictions could launch new examinations and expand existing examinations the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue and additional examinations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations proceedings and contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty

we may not realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and cost effectively we may adjust employment optimize our footprint or undertake other restructuring activities these activities are complex and may involve or require significant changes to our operations if we do not successfully manage restructuring activities expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized and our operations and business could be disrupted risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions additional unexpected costs adverse effects on employee morale the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions otherwise harm our business or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

antitakeover provisions could enable our board of directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareholders 

otis’ amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with otis’ board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 1 the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on otis’ board of directors except in an instance where a director is removed by shareholders and the resulting vacancy is filled by shareholders 2 limitations on shareholders’ ability to call a special shareholder meeting 3 rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings and 4 the right of otis’ board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 

in addition we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with persons that acquire more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock 

we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with otis’ board of directors and by providing otis’ board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make otis immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that otis’ board of directors determines is not in the best interests of otis and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or issuance of our stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the internal revenue code code causing the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation to be taxable to rtx under the tma we would be required to indemnify rtx for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our shareholders may consider favorable 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the state courts within the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against otis and our directors and officers 

otis’ amended and restated bylaws provide that unless otis’ board of directors otherwise determines the state courts within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of otis any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of otis to otis or its shareholders including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against otis or any current or former director or officer or other employee of otis arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws any action asserting a claim relating to or involving otis governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in section 115 of the dgcl 

to the fullest extent permitted by law this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims including claims under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act although otis shareholders will not be deemed to have waived otis’ compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with claims subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable 

this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with otis or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against otis and our directors and officers alternatively if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to the separation 

our historical information is not necessarily indicative of the results that we will achieve as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical information in this form 10k for the periods prior to the separation is derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of our former parent utc and is based on a number of estimates and assumptions accordingly such historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we will achieve as a separate publicly traded company prior to the separation our business had been operated by utc as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company as part of our former parent utc we were able to enjoy certain benefits from utc’s operating diversity purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with utc’s other businesses additionally utc or one of its affiliates performed or helped perform various corporate functions for us such as accounting auditing tax legal human resources investor relations risk management treasury and other general and administrative functions our historical and pro forma financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from utc for such functions which are likely to be less than the expenses we will incur as a separate publicly traded company in addition the diversification of our sales costs and cash flows have diminished as a standalone company such that our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments and service debt may be diminished and we are no longer able to use cash flow from utcs other businesses as part of its centralized cash management systems to fund our investments and operations accordingly for these reasons as well as the additional risks related to the separation noted below we may not achieve the expected benefits of the separation 

as a result of the separation certain members of management directors and shareholders may own stock in rtx otis and carrier  and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest 

management and directors of each of rtx otis and carrier may own common stock in all three companies as a result of the separation this ownership overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other two companies for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and otis’ relationship with rtx and carrier thereafter 

we may not be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions as a result of the separation and the related tma 

under current us federal income tax law a spinoff that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its shareholders as a result of certain postspinoff transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the spunoff corporation to preserve the taxfree treatment of the separation and in addition to otis’ indemnity obligation described below the tma restricts us for the twoyear period following the separation except in specific circumstances from 1 entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of otis stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 2 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 3 repurchasing shares of otis stock other than in certain openmarket transactions and 4 ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses the tma also prohibits us from taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the separation and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code or for applicable nonus income tax purposes further the tma imposes similar restrictions on us and our subsidiaries during the twoyear period following the separation that are intended to prevent certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization from failing to qualify as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code or for applicable nonus income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business 

in connection with the separation each of rtx otis and carrier agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities if we are required to pay under these indemnities to rtx andor carrier our financial results could be negatively impacted also the rtx or carrier indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which rtx and carrier are allocated responsibility and rtx andor carrier may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement the tma and the ema each party agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide rtx andor carrier are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that rtx andor carrier has agreed to retain the indemnities from rtx and carrier for our benefit may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and rtx andor carrier may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to such indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from rtx or carrier as applicable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if the separation together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock or the stock of rtx we as well as rtx carrier and rtxs shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities in addition if certain internal restructuring transactions were to fail to qualify as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal or nonus income tax purposes we as well as rtx and carrier could be subject to significant tax liabilities in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify rtx for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tma 

in connection the separation our former parent utc received a ruling from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the separation under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and rely on among other 

things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of utc and rtx otis and carrier including those relating to the past and future conduct of utc and rtx otis and carrier notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the separation andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs ruling or the opinion of counsel was based were inaccurate or have not been complied with in addition the irs ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the separation together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by utc of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the separation andor certain related transactions did not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 

if the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes rtx would recognize a taxable gain as if it had sold the common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and rtx shareholders who received common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares even if the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation were to otherwise qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code it may result in taxable gain to rtx but not its shareholders under section 355e of the code if the separation were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in rtx or otis for this purpose any acquisitions of rtx or otis shares within the period beginning two years before the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation and ending two years after such distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although rtx or otis may be able to rebut that presumption including by qualifying for one or more safe harbors under applicable treasury regulations 

in addition in connection with and prior to the separation utc and its subsidiaries completed various internal reorganization transactions with respect to certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization utc obtained tax rulings in certain nonus jurisdictions andor opinions of external tax advisors in each case regarding the tax treatment of such transactions such tax rulings and opinions were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations including with respect to certain valuation matters relating to the internal reorganization statements and undertakings of utc and rtx otis carrier or their respective subsidiaries if any of these representations or statements were or become inaccurate or incomplete or if rtx otis carrier or any of their respective subsidiaries do not fulfill or otherwise comply with any such undertakings or covenants such tax rulings andor opinions may be invalid or the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized further notwithstanding receipt of any such tax rulings andor opinions there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant transactions differs from the conclusions reached in the relevant tax rulings andor opinions in the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant transaction we as well as rtx and carrier could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

under the tma otis generally is required to indemnify rtx and carrier for any taxes resulting from the separation and certain related transactions and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from 1 an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of otis whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition 2 other actions or failures to act by otis or 3 certain of otis’ representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated further under the tma we generally are required to indemnify rtx and carrier for a specified portion of any taxes and any related costs and other damages a arising as a result of the failure of the separation and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree including as a result of section 355e of the code or a failure of any internal separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree to so qualify in each case to the extent such amounts do not result from a disqualifying action by or acquisition of equity securities of otis carrier or rtx or b arising from an adjustment pursuant to an audit or other tax proceeding with respect to any transaction undertaken in connection with the separation that is not intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree any such indemnity obligations could be material 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation our former parent utc undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which including the separation of otis may be subject to various fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation 1 was insolvent was rendered insolvent by reason of the separation or had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital and 2 received less than fair consideration in connection with the reorganization or intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured then the court could void the separation in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareholders to return to rtx some or all of the shares of the common stock issued in the distribution or require rtx or otis as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency would vary depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities including the probable amount of contingent liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that otis or any of its subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the distribution

results of operations 

net sales

selling general and administrative 



2021 compared with 2020 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 24 million or 12 in 2021 the primary drivers of the change are the following 

• higher employment and information technology costs including incremental standalone public company costs and the absence of cost containment actions taken during 2020 in response to covid19 

• impact of unfavorable foreign exchange of 38 million compared to 2020 

• these increases were partially offset by lower nonrecurring separationrelated costs and the absence of utc allocations of 105 million

restructuring cos ts 



we initiate restructuring actions to keep our cost structure competitive charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions an d to a lesser degree facility exit and lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of office and manufacturing operations we continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions 

total 2021 restructuring costs include 41 million of costs related to 2021 actions 13 million of costs related to 2020 actions and 2 million of costs related to pre2020 actions  

most of the expected charges will require cash payments which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations during 2021 we had cash outflows of approximately 51 million related to the restructuring actions and expect to make cash payments of 47 million to complete the actions announced which is comprised of 7 million of additional restructuring expenses and 40 million of existing restructuring accruals as of december 31 2021 

we generally expect to achieve annual recurring savings within the twoyear period subsequent to initiating the actions including 41 million for the 2021 actions and 55 million for the 2020 actions of which approximately 66 million was realized for the 2021 and 2020 actions during the current year

other income expense net 



other income expense net primarily includes the impact of changes in the fair value and settlement of derivatives gains or losses on sale of businesses and fixed assets earnings from equity method investments fair value changes on equity securities impairments nonrecurring separationrelated expenses and certain other operating items 

the change in other income expense net of 86 milli on in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of a fixed asset impairment of 71 million and related licensing costs of 14 million recognized during 2020

income taxes 



the 2021 2020 and 2019 effective tax rates are higher than the statutory us rate primarily due to higher international tax rates as compared to the lower us federal statutory rate and foreign earnings subject to us tax under the provisions of the us tax cuts and jobs act tcja 

the 2021 effective tax rate is lower than the 2020 effective tax rate primarily due to the following 

• 16 million tax benefit related to repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of changes to planned debt repayments and in estimates related to otis’ preseparation tax attributes 

• 16 million decrease in us tax related to base erosion and antiabuse tax in 2021

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalent s of approximately 16 billion of which ap proximately 91 was held by the companys foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed on occasion we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations related to acquisitions and divestitures or other legal obligations as of december 31 2021 and 2020  the amount of such restricted cash was approximatel y 19 billion and 19 million respectively including the proceeds from the issuance of debt that is restricted in order to fund the tender offer see further discussion of debt issuances below 

from timetotime we may need to access the capital markets to obtain financing we may incur indebtedness or issue equity as needed although we believe that the arrangements in place as of december 31 2021 permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future could be impacted by many factors including 1 our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating 2 the liquidity of the overall capital markets and 3 the current state of the economy including the impact of covid19 there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us 

the following is a summary of the longterm debt issuances in 2021 and 2020 



the net proceeds from the february and march 2020 debt issuances listed above totaling 63 billion were used to distribute cash to utc as part of the separation in 2020 the proceeds from the march 2021 issuance of japanese yen notes listed above were used to repay a portion of our outstanding euro denominated commercial paper the proceeds from the november 2021 issuance of the euro notes listed above are held in escrow to fund the tender offer which is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 

the following is a summary of the longterm debt repayments in 2021 and 2020 



in 2020 we repaid the 10 billion term loan in full using cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of euro denominated and us dollar denominated commercial paper in 2021 the commercial paper was repaid in full using cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of the japanese yen notes for additional discussion of borrowings including commercial paper activity see note 10 borrowings and lines of credit in item 8 in this form 10k 

following the enactment of the tcja and after reassessing as part of the separation the company determined that it no longer intends to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the us for the remainder of the company’s undistributed international earnings unless tax effective to repatriate we will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings 

we expect to fund our ongoing operating investing and financing requirements mainly through cash flows from operations available liquidity through cash on hand and available bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets 

on april 27 2020 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 10 billion of common stock of which approximately 725 million has been utilized as of december 31 2021 under this program shares may be purchased on the open market in privately negotiated transactions under accelerated share repurchas e programs or under plans complying with rules 10b51 and 10b18 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during 2021 the company repurchased 97 million shares of common stock for approximately 725 million as a result of the increased debt incurred to fund the tender offer we have temporarily suspended share repurchases as we focus on deleveraging 

cash flow  operating activities 



2021 compared with 2020 

cash generated from operating activities in 2021 was 270 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher net income of 364 million and increased cash inflows related to current assets and current liabilities activity of 83 million  as described below these were partially offset by 98 million of lower noncash adjustments from net income including the absence of fixed asset impairments of 71 million in 2020 as well as 106 million of lower other operating activities net primarily due to longterm accruals in 2020 

2021 changes in working capital 

the 2021 cash inflows related to current assets and current liabilities operating activity were 160 million including the following main drivers 

• accounts payable which increased by 130 million primarily due to increased volume 

• accrued liabilities which increased by 72 million primarily due to the timing of payments which more than offset the payments of 56 million in foreign tax obligations pursuant to the tma and income tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions 

• contract assets current and contract liabilities current net change of 53 million driven by the timing of billings on contracts compared to the progression on current contracts and 

• other current assets which decreased by 43 million primarily due to prepaid income tax utilization and indemnification payments received pursuant to the tma in order to pay foreign tax obligation s partially offset by advanced payments to suppliers partially offset by 

• accounts receivable net which increased by 152 million primarily due to increased volume 

2020 compared with 2019 

cash generated from operating activities in 2020 was 11 million higher than in 2019  primarily due to increased cash inflows related to current assets and current liabilities of 109 million as described below there were also increased other operating activities of 106 million compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increased longterm accruals these were partially offset by lower net income of 211 million which includes the impact of interest expense on debt incremental standalone public company costs and nonrecurring separationrelated costs in 2020 

2020 changes in working capital 

the 2020 cash inflows related to current assets and current liabilities operating activity were 77 million these cash inflows were primarily driven by 

• net change in contract assets current and contract liabilities current of 282 million driven by the timing of billings on contracts compared to the progression on current contracts and 

• accounts payable which increased by 20 million primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers partially offset by 

• inventories net which increased by 76 million due to the impact of higher production inventory levels related to the timing of deliveries to construction sites and 

• accounts receivable net which increased by 163 million due to slower collections and increased customer financing activity 

additionally other current assets decreased by 28 million due to receipt of indemnification payments pursuant to the tma in order to pay foreign tax obligations partially offset by tax prepayments in certain jurisdictions while accrued liabilities decreased 14 million largely due to the payment of foreign tax obligations pursuant to the tma described above and income tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions partially offset by accruals for interest in excess of interest payments the r eceipt and payment of indemnification assets and foreign tax obligations resulted in no net cash flow for 2020 see note 5 related parties in item 8 in this form 10k for further discussion on transactions with our former parent utc

• 91 million higher net cash from equity securities including 58 million of proceeds from the sale of equity securities in 2021 compared to 51 million of investments made in equity securities in 2020 and 

• 31 million higher other investing activities net primarily due to property damage insurance proceeds received and discussed below under germany fire as well as proceeds from the sales of fixed assets 

as discussed in note 18 financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes we operate internationally and in the normal course of business are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices these fluctuations can increase the costs of financing investing and operating the business we use derivative instruments including forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency and commodity price exposures 

germany fire 

as previously disclosed during 2020 there was a fire at the company’s manufacturing facility in germany during 2021 the company settled the related property damage claim with the insurance company as reflected in other investing activities net in the consolidated statements of cash flows during 2021 the company also reached a final agreement with the insurance company related to the business interruption claim to cover costs incurred as a result of the fire and received the final payments during the year the impact to our operations or financial results from this event was not material

2021 compared to 2020 



net cash provided by financing activities was 58 million in 2021 compared to net cash used by financing activities of 844 million in 2020 which changed primarily due to the following 

• net borrowings of 14 billion during 2021 compared to net repayments on borrowings of 353 million during 2020 these were comprised of the following activities 

◦ net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 20 billion partially offset by net repayments of shortterm borrowings of 655 million during 2021 and

critical accounting estimates 

preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

revenue recognition from contracts with customers 

we recognized revenue in accordance with fasb asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers and its related amendments referred to collectively as asc 606” for new equipment and modernization contracts equipment and installation are typically procured in a single contract providing the customer with a complete installed elevator or escalator unit the combination of equipment and installation promises are typically a single performance obligation for these performance obligations revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress contract costs are usually incurred over a period of time which can be several years and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment contract costs included in the calculation are comprised of labor materials subcontractors’ costs or other direct costs and indirect costs which include indirect labor costs 

the longterm nature of the contracts the complexity of the products and the scale of the projects can affect our ability to estimate costs precisely we review cost estimates on significant new equipment and modernization contracts on a quarterly basis and for others no less frequently than annually or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate we record changes in contract estimates using the cumulative catchup method and we review changes in contract estimates for their impact on net sales or operating profit in the consolidated financial statements modifications are recognized as a cumulative catchup or treated as a separate accounting contract if the modification adds distinct goods or services and the modification is priced at its standalone selling price 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in item 8 in this form 10k 

income taxes 

the future tax benefit arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was 647 million as of december 31 2021 and 642 million as of december 31 2020 management estimates that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be generally sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits which may be realized over an extended period of time for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted conversely if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements see note 3 earnings per share and note 15 accumulated other comprehensive income loss in item 8 in this form 10k for further discussion additionally see note 22 contingent liabilities in item 8 in this form 10k for discussion of administrative review proceedings with the german tax office 

goodwill 

we have generated goodwill as a result of our acquisitions at the time of acquisition we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date the fair value of the consideration paid including contingent consideration is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

we review our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at july 1 or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at a level within the company referred to as the reporting unit which is one level below the operating segment level we have determined there to be three reporting units within each business segment 

in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 350 intangibles – goodwill and other  we initially perform a qualitative assessment commonly known as “step zero” to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the twostep test the qualitative assessment requires judgments by management about economic conditions including the entity’s operating environment its industry and other market considerations entityspecific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel and other events that could impact the reporting unit if management concludes based on assessment of relevant events facts and circumstances that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying value no further impairment testing is required if we determine based on this assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit no impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting exceeds its carrying value 

we completed the annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units as of july 1 2021 and d etermined that no adjustment to goodwill was necessary as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value of each reporting unit 

contingent liabilities 

otis is party to litigation related to a n umber of matters as described in note 22 contingent liabilities in item 8 in this form 10k in particular they may include risks associated with contractual regulatory and other matters which may arise in the ordinary course of business the outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the financial position results of operations or cash flows management regularly analyzes current information about these matters and accrues for contingent losses that are probable and reasonably estimable to assess the exposure to potential liability we consult with relevant internal and external counsel in making the decision regarding the need for loss accruals management considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of loss see part i item 1a in this form 10k for further discussion 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor domestic and international defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of increase in employee compensation levels and mortality rates assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of december 31 a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 

in the following table we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations as of december 31 2021 



the impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is less tha n 1 million 

pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected longterm rate of asset return an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of asset return would have decreased or increased 2021 pension expense by approximatel y 2 million 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure pension liabilities and costs utilize each plan’s specific cash flows and are then compared to highquality bond indices for reasonableness global market interest rates increased in 2021 as compared with 2020 and a s a result the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure pension liabilities was 15 in 2021 and 11 in 2020 

see note 13 employee benefit plans in item 8 in this form 10k for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we extend a variety of financial guarantees to third parties in support of our business we also have obligations arising from environmental health and safety tax and employment matters circumstances that could cause the contingent obligations and liabilities arising from these arrangements to come to fruition include changes in the underlying transaction nonperformance under a contract or deterioration in the financial condition of the guaranteed party 

otis contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2021 are discussed below see also note 13 employee benefit plans in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our expected pension and postretirement contributions 

longterm debt 

see note 10 borrowings and lines of credit in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our longterm debt principal payments as of december 31 2021 in the following table we show the timing of payments of interest on longterm debt as of december 31 2021 



purchase obligations 

purchase obligations include amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders where it is not practically feasible to determine the legally enforceable portion of our obligation under certain of our longterm purchase agreements we include additional expected purchase obligations beyond what may be legally enforceable we enter into contractual purchase commitments with suppliers and service vendors to support our information technology that are either necessary to operate our business or are resulting from implementing strategic initiatives in the following table we show the timing of payments of total purchase obligations as of december 31 2021 



other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities in the table below includes obligations relate to product service and warranty policies estimated remediation costs and contractual indemnities and are included in other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets in item 8 of this form 10k the timing of expected cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon managements estimates over the terms of these agreements and is largely based upon historical experience and were as follows as of december 31 2021 



the balance above includes 220 million of longterm contractual payables due to rtx for reimbursement of tax payments that rtx is responsible to pay after the separation pursuant to the tma otis will reimburse rtx for those tax payments through 2027 

unrecognized tax benefits 

otis has unrecognized tax benefits of 392 million as of december 31 2021  the timing of which is uncertain to become payable see note 16 income taxes in item 8 in this form 10k for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices to manage certain of those exposures we use derivative instruments including forward contracts derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve relatively little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes we diversify the counterparties used and monitor the concentration of risk to limit our counterparty exposure 

we have evaluated our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates in our market risk sensitive instruments which are primarily cash debt and derivative instruments using a value at risk analysis based on a 95 confidence level and oneday holding period as of december 31 2021  the potential loss in fair value on our market risk sensitive instruments was not material in relation to our financial position results of operations or cash flows our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses based on volatilities and correlations and is not necessarily indicative of actual results add itionally any losses or gains on derivative instruments would be mostly offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 

refer to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies note 10 borrowings and lines of credit and note 18 financial instruments i n item 8 in this form 10k for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange interest rates and financial instruments including the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency and commodity price hedges 

foreign currency exposures 

the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may impact otis’ financial results we have a high volume of foreign currency exposures that result from our international sales purchases investments and other international transactions international sales were approxi mately 106 billion 93 billion and 95 billion in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales as well as foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that are created in the ordinary course of business more than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset are generally hedged with foreign currency derivatives 

for our nonus based entities a substantial portion of revenues are generated and costs are incurred in local currencies we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates we periodically enter into sales contracts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the parties to the transaction which can create foreign exchange exposure while the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts changes in the sales profile volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations otis does not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 

as discussed in note 18 financial instruments in item 8 in this form 10k as of december 31 2021 we hav e ¥215 billion 189 million of japanese yen denominated longterm debt which qualifies as a net investment hedge against our investments in japanese businesses as of december 31 2021 the net investment hedge is deemed to be effective 

as discussed in note 10 borrowings and lines of credit in item 8 in this form 10k as of december 31 2021 we have €1600 million 1807 million of euro denominated longterm debt 

commodity price risk 

the fluctuation in prices of certain raw materials may impact otis financial results we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and component parts such as steel aluminum and copper among others when possible and appropriate we maintain fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts however we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire when possible and appropriate we also include price escalation linked to commodity prices in contracts with our customers and take pricing actions for future contracts however products and services delivered to our customers are often provided a year or more after being agreed to and not all raw material price increases can be passed along to customers with existing contracts therefore when commodity price risk is not mitigated by other methods we may enter into hedging contracts otis does not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

our longterm debt portfolio primarily consists of fixedrate instruments for any variable rate debt interest rate changes in the london interbank offered rate libor will impact future earnings and cash flows from time to time we may hedge floating rates using interest rate swaps the hedges would be designated as fair value hedges and the gains and losses on the swaps would be reported in interest expense reflecting that portion of interest expense at a variable rate

description of business by segment 

our company is organized into two segments new equipment and service which for the year ended december 31 2020 contributed 42 percent and 58 percent of our net sales and 16 percent and 84 percent of our segment operating profit respectively 

new equipment 

through our new equipment segment we design manufacture sell and install a wide range of passenger and freight elevators as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential commercial and infrastructure projects in 2020 our new equipment segment had sales of 54 billion and operating profit of 318 million in 2020 our new equipment unit sales in china represented over half of our global new equipment sales by unit volume 

we have developed a range of elevator and escalator solutions to meet the varying needs and objectives of our diverse customers our primary elevator and escalator solutions are described below 

otis’ nextgeneration digitally native gen360 elevator piloted in 2020 allows us to move from a predominantly mechanical system to an electronic architecture gen360 offers a compact design and footprint that frees up space in buildings combined with builtin otis one connectivity providing proactive predictive and transparent information to our technicians and customers this technology combination helps to reduce entrapments expands predictive and remote maintenance capabilities and leads to improved elevator uptime and service productivity otis also offers a range of passenger experience enhancements such as eview and otis ecall  e view is an incar display providing customized passenger content and communications otis ecall enables passengers within a building to call an elevator using an app on their mobile devices 

the gen2 system is the basis for our principal lowand midrise elevator solution the gen2 system relies on compact elevator components that can fit within the elevator hoistway and can eliminate the need for a machineroom which releases rentable or usable space during 2020 we continued to expand this product offering launching gen2 prime in india and other developing countries for the lowrise entrylevel segment since its inception in 2000 otis has sold over one million gen2 units 

we enhance the effectiveness of our elevator solutions by offering our proprietary compass destination dispatch management system compass groups passengers by their desired destination and directs them to an assigned car that minimizes waiting and ride time the systems algorithms anticipate traffic demand within a building and improves traffic flow 

in addition to elevator solutions we also offer escalators and moving walkways with a range of finishes and aesthetics otis escalators integrate easily with building designs our smart design and features enhance sustainability and passenger safety such as sensorequipped escalators and moving walkways that efficiently run only when passengers approach or operate at reduced speeds to conserve energy when there are no riders 

our new equipment customers include realestate and building developers and general contractors who develop andor design buildings for residential commercial retail or mixeduse activity we also sell new equipment to government agencies to support infrastructure projects such as airports railways or metros we generally sell directly to our customers through our new equipment sales personnel in china due to the large and widespread nature of the customer base our direct sales force is augmented by agents and distributors we also rely on agents and distributors to sell our new equipment in certain countries and territories given the breadth of our customer base and the large number of customers to whom we deliver new equipment on an annual basis we are not dependent on any single customer and do not have any material contracts with any single customer our network of agents and distributors is broad and geographically dispersed and we do not rely on or have any material contracts with any single agent or distributor 

table of contents 

new equipment customers typically engage with us at an early stage during the construction cycle the timing of order placement depends on factors including project complexity and customer requirements elevator installation usually occurs midway through building construction 

most new equipment orders are delivered w ithin 12 months of booking though larger projects can take longer to deliver based on customer construction schedules component leadtim e is generally not a constraining factor when placing new equipment orders customers typically make an advance payment to cover costs including design and contract engineering these advance payments are typically followed by periodic progress payments at specified milestones such as delivery of materials at the job site and completion of installation and equipment commissioning installation is carried out by our installation technicians or through subcontractors in which case we typically complete the final inspection and commissioning to ensure that our quality standards are met revenues are recognized based on percentage of completion once commissioned new equipment units are typically supported by a warranty for a limited period of time 

service 

through our service segment we perform maintenance and repair services as well as modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators we have a maintenance portfolio of over 2 million units globally which includes otis equipment manufactured and sold by us as well as equipment from other original equipment manufacturers through our network of service sales personnel we sell our services directly to customers in all significant elevator and escalator endsegments around the world in 2020 our service segment had net sales of 74 billion and operating profit of 16 billion 

service customers typically comprise building owners facility managers housing associations and government agencies that operate buildings where elevators and escalators are installed customers securing services for elevators are frequently different from those who initially make purchasing decisions with respect to new equipment solutions with over 2 million maintenance units under contract globally we have a wide range of customers in our service segment and do not have any single material service contract contract duration depends on a number of factors including customer needs regulatory requirements and industrygeography dynamics we work closely with our customers to renew these contracts as appropriate certain types of customers such as those owning or operating large properties or portfolios of properties tend to execute longterm maintenance agreements 

we grow our maintenance portfolio through conversion of newly installed units into maintenance contracts through prospecting and winning units already in service from customers using another service provider and through acquisitions our service sales personnel seek to win service contracts upon the expiration or termination of existing service contracts from customers by offering a superior value proposition through service excellence an engaged and technically sophisticated group of field service technicians a streamlined customer experience and strong elevator and escalator operating performance 

our services include inspections preventive maintenance offerings and other customized maintenance offerings tailored to meet customer needs a basic maintenance contract provides for inspection consistent with local regulatory needs we also provide customers with repair services to address equipment and component wear and tear as well as breakdowns we offer incremental tiered maintenance and service offerings with varying levels of coverage up to and including comprehensive component replacement coverage 

similar to most other electromechanical equipment elevators and escalators are subject to wear and tear which over time erodes equipment functionality as elevator equipment ages we work with customers to help renew or refresh their elevators with modernization solutions that enhance equipment operation and improve building functionality modernization offerings can range from relatively simple upgrades of interior finishes and aesthetics to complex upgrades of larger components and subsystems 

we provide our service offerings to our customers through a global network of approximately 33000 service mechanics operating out of over 1400 branches and offices typically located in close proximity to concentrations of customers our mechanics are critical to our ability to deliver a high level of service to our customers our otisline operations provide personalized customer support 247 they receive customer service requests and assign and dispatch field technicians as necessary to respond to service requests our network of service parts centers repair centers and obsolescence management capabilities are key enablers to supporting customers by keeping their elevators and escalators in good working condition 

we are a pioneer in connected elevator and escalator units since 1985 we have installed and supported remote elevator monitoring where elevators and escalators are connected to otisline through telecommunication links we have deep 

table of contents 

experience in collecting analyzing and implementing data from remotely monitored elevators and developing insights to improve equipment operation in 2020 we launched otis one an iot solution providing active monitoring and cloudbased actionable analytics to our otis experts technicians and customers otis one provides realtime visibility of the entire portfolio a range of health and diagnostic information and analytics to improve elevator uptime this solution is proven to enhance customer satisfaction improving retention conversions and recaptures by the end of 2020 we deployed and connected nearly 100000 otis one units primarily in europe with the addition of the otis one units our total global portfolio of connected units is approximately 540000 units as of december 31 2020 in 2021 we will continue to innovate and expand our digital ecosystem and suite of digital solutions for both our existing service portfolio customers and for new equipment shipments from our factories 

research and development  intellectual property 

innovation is a fundamental characteristic of our history and is central to our strategy for the year ended december 31 2020 research and development rd expense was 152 million and 12 as a percentage of net sales in addition to research and development expense we made investments in digital and strategic initiatives of approximately 47 million which in combination with research and development expense was 16 as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 

we coordinate our rd efforts globally through an operating model that sets global and local priorities based on customer and segment needs we have several rd centers and factories around the world including major locations in china india france spain and the united states the centers are strategically located close to concentrations of customers to enable efficient development of engineering solutions that can serve a s global model products and adapt quickly and efficiently to local customer needs and local demographic and construction trends we have approximately 1300 engineers globally with increasing focus on digital initiatives software design and user interface and the user experience 

we maintain a portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to the otis business to protect our rd investments in products and services we currently own approximately 3000 globally issued patents and we have approximately 3100 patent applications pending globally of which 2500 applicatio ns were filed in the last three years our patents are primarily filed in europe the united states and asia we believe that our patents and trade secrets create a competitive advantage and that we have taken reasonable measures to build a portfolio of valid and enforceable intellectual property rights however these intellectual property rights might be challenged and could be found invalid or unenforceable loss of strategic patents and trade secrets could significantly affect our competitiveness see item 1a risk factors” in this form 10k for further discussion of intellectual property matters 

joint ventures and nonwholly owned subsidiaries 

our international strategic relationships joint ventures and nonwholly owned subsidiaries are an important part of our business as they support our access to international markets and customers results of these entities are consolidated with our financial and operational results in addition to china and spain as discussed below we also operate joint ventures in other countries including russia kuwait malaysia saudi arabia and the united arab emirates 

china 

we operate in china through two principal joint ventures otis elevator china investment company limited “otis china” and otis electric elevator company limited “otis electric” otis china is a joint venture established in 1998 for the purpose of manufacturing installing and servicing elevators escalators and related equipment in china we are a majority owner of otis china and tianjin tai kang investment co ltd “tianjin tai kang” is our joint venture partner otis electric a subsidiary of otis china is a joint venture established in 1997 for the purpose of manufacturing installing and servicing elevators escalators and related equipment both in and outside china otis china owns a controlling equity stake in otis electric otis china’s partner in otis electric is xizi elevator group co

spain 

we conduct our operations in spain through zardoya otis sa “zardoya otis” which manufactures installs and services elevators and elevator equipment in spain and exports elevator equipment it manufactures for installation by certain of our subsidiaries outside of spain zardoya otis’ shares are listed on the madrid stock exchange and the company is subject to the regulations of the spanish stock exchange market national commission we own a majority equity stake in zardoya otis with euro syns sa owning a minority position and the remaining shares being held by public shareholders 

competition 

we operate in a global and highly competitive industry due to the global and localized nature of the industry there are numerous participants of varying size that operate in our industry according to industry estimates there are several hundred participants that offer new equipment solutions and several thousand participants that offer maintenance and service solutions in both the new equipment and service segments major competitors globally include kone oyj schindler group and tk elevator while there are a number of additional competitors in the asia pacific region competitive dynamics vary significantly by segment and geography in the service segment independent service providers and other small operators are significant competitors in most of our local geographies we estimate small and independent service providers globally have an aggregate portfolio of about 50 perc ent of service units but these small and independent service providers account for a smaller percentage of the service business when measured by value because of the types of units and level of maintenance covered by these providers 

there are several factors that determine competitiveness in the industry including local codes and compliance requirements customer preferences price reputation delivery and execution product quality equipment performance reliability and longterm service and product support our success in both our new equipment and service segments depends upon our ability to develop and market our products services and solutions as well as our ability to provide the people technologies facilities equipment and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency we believe our global presence local relationships and proven track record in executing complex elevator and escalator solutions contribute to our iconic brand reputation and competitive position in the industry we believe our business strategies sustain new equipment growth accelerate service portfolio growth advance the digitalization of otis and focus and empower the organization will support our ability to successfully compete across the new equipment and service segments and will help deliver sustainable earnings growth 

compliance with government regulations 

we conduct our business through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide any changes in legislation or government policies impacting our industry including with respect to employee safety laborrelated regulations industrial equipment licensing requirements foreign ownership limitations and building and elevator safety codes can affect our worldwide operations we closely monitor local legislation and government policies in the locations in which we operate as they set the maintenance requirements for our customers 

in addition our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulations promulgated by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes and regulations for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

us laws regulations orders and other measures concerning the export or reexport of products software services and technology to and other traderelated activities involving nonus countries and parties affect the operations of otis and its affiliates as do those of other countries pertaining to similar matters

seasonality 

our business and operating results are generally not subject to significant fluctuations as a result of seasonality although we have experienced lower new equipment sales in asia in the first calendar quarter coinciding with lunar new year celebrations in addition we have also experienced lower new equipment sales in the fourth quarter in china due to a national holiday that occurs during the first week of october which may impact the relative mix of sales within the quarter 

raw materials and supplies 

due to the global and distributed nature of our operations we partner with a diverse network of several thousand suppliers globally these include product and nonproduct suppliers as well as subcontractors we rely on approximately 500 key s uppliers for our manufacturing supply chain 

components and systems necessary to effectively complete our new equipment projects as well as to satisfy our maintenance and repair obligations are often available from two or more sources within the industry while we believe no single supplier is material to our business some components or applications require particular specifications or qualifications in those cases there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components which could result in supply constraints or cost pressures due to an issue with such a supplier including financial or operational difficulties or a contract dispute we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources 

although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our business have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee nearterm unavailability of materials components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

see item 1a risk factors” section in this form 10k for further discussion on the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials and risks associated with our supply chain 

human capital 

as of december 31 2020 our global workforce consists of approximately 69000 employees divided as follows 41 in asia 37 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 22 in the americas 

approximately 64 of our employees in the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us our employees are represented by workers councils or statutory labor unions as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions  while we strive to maintain good relationships with our employee representative bodies our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force t he collective bargaining agreement for most of our bargaining unit employees in the us was renewed without disruption in july 2017 and is set to expire in july 2022 although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of this contract in 20212022 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows financial condition or results of operations for a discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment see “risk factors” “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 16 restructuring costs to the consolidated financial statements included in 2020 annual report 

safety and health 

safety is one of the otis absolutes for that reason safety measures and indicators are regularly monitored by management and reported to our board of directors to promote safety we have a health and safety management system and regularly measure the effectiveness of our health and safety programs we empower all of our employees and subcontractors with stop work authority if they perceive an unsafe condition or a behavior that may cause injury we also seek to promote a culture where stop work authority can be freely exercised without the fear of retribution or retaliation and a learning culture to enhance the quality and delivery of safety and technical training 

for employees to be effective they need to be healthy in 2020 with the added stress of the covid19 pandemic we increased our efforts to improve our employees’ mental health by expanding employee assistance plan benefits and by bringing increased attention to the importance of mental health we also covered the cost of covid19 testing and treatment for our

us based employees and covered family members under our welfare plans and amended our 401k savings plan to enhance loan eligibility and repayment terms and to permit certain distributions in response to the threats of the covid19 pandemic we have where possible also offered remote work flexibility 

training and development 

we strive to emphasize employee development and training as we believe that individual and corporate success is driven by lifelong learning and by empowering employees as a result we provide a range of development and mentoring opportunities that vary based on an employee’s career stage and function one of our flagship programs is “otis university” a global program that builds leadership and functional capabilities in sales field engineering operations and major projects we are very proud of our “employee scholar program” which is a comprehensive companysponsored education program that allows employees to expand their skills through degree or certification programs since the programs inception in 1997 otis as a business unit of utc and following the separation has supported otis colleagues in receiving more than 5000 degrees across 60 countries through an investment of over 90 million in the employee scholar program 

ensuring that we have access to trained technicians is very important to our business our mechanics receive extensive training to service and install equipment safely this training which is provided by otis and our unions consists of live virtual and onthejob modules with experienced mechanics to help us attract talent and provide us with a pipeline of trained mechanics in china we have partnered with five technology schools in the country to offer the otis technology academy the students in the technology schools are provided with technical training certifications handson access to our equipment and an otis apprenticeship period we are also increasing the number of females in our mechanic population across the world in order to enhance diversity and to obtain access to a larger talent pool 

commitment to change 

as a newly independent company we aim to be an equalopportunity employer of choice for people of broad perspectives and experiences cultures genders races and generations we want to be a business whose workforce mirrors the diversity of our customers and the communities where we live and work and a place where every voice feels safe welcomed and heard to help us achieve these objectives we made the following commitments

our international operations subject us to risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in local and regional economic conditions such as fluctuations in exchange rates risks associated with government policies on international trade and investments and risks associated with china and other emerging markets 

we conduct our business on a global basis with approxim ately 73 percent of our 2020 net sales derived from international operations changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctu ations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our nonus operations where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies in addition currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay for the materials used in our products though we engage in hedging strategies to manage foreign currency exposures in connection with certain crossborder transactions our operating margins may be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations that result in higher costs or lower revenues for certain crossborder transactions our financial statements are denominated in us dollars accordingly fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to gains or losses when financial statements of nonus operating units are translated into us dollars given that the majority of our sales are nonus based a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to investments and limitations on foreign ownership of businesses taxation foreign exchange controls capital controls employment regulations and the repatriation of earnings government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas capital controls punitive taxes or tariffs or similar trade barriers whether imposed by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or services or encumber our ability to manufacture or sell products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements with the us or countries where we sell large quantities of products and services procure materials incorporated into our products manufacture products or recruit and employ employees including the new us administration trade relations between the us and china as discussed below and the uk’s recent withdrawal from the eu could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including our ability to r ecruit and retain employees or deploy certain employees to the geographies where their skills are best utilized our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign nations’ priorities including government budgets as well as to political and economic instability international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries 

china is currently the largest end market for sales of new equipment in our industry and sales in china represent over half of our global new equipment net sales by unit volume changes to market and economic conditions in china or an escalation of trade conflicts between the us and china may impact our ability to continue new equipment net sales in china at rates consistent with prior years furthermore as is the case in many countries where we operate the legal and regulatory regime in china is evolving and accordingly we could in the future be required to comply with significant requirements unique to china in order to maintain access to chinese markets 

we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as those and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products and services a slowdown in urbanization in emerging countries such as china or india could adversely affect our financial performance in addition as part of our global business model we operate in certain countries including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa ukraine turkey and countries in the middle east that carry high levels of currency political compliance and economic risk our emerging market operations can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices compliance risks economic and government instability currency fluctuations and the imposition of foreign exchange and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts components subsystems and thirdparty manufacturing services in our business and significant shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers including thirdparty manufacturers and commodity markets to secure the raw materials and components used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials issues with suppliers such as a disruption in deliveries capacity constraints production disruptions quality issues and supplier closings or bankruptcies price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers could damage our reputation or could increase our operating costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance or purchasing patterns of key distributors and agents could adversely affect us 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and agents particularly in china that have valuable relationships with customers some of these distributors and agents also sell our competitors’ products and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns or compliance practices could adversely affect our reputation competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we design manufacture install and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

we seek to grow our business through the design development production sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the product and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in technologies products and services our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements such as the development and execution of advanced digital technologies for the benefit of our new equipment or service segment or the development of new products depend on a variety of factors including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedules execution of internal and external performance plans availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials performance of suppliers and subcontractors hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiencies validation of innovative technologies and customer interest in new technologies and products and acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop 

our research and development efforts may not result in innovative products or services that incorporate new technologies for our new equipment and service segments or products or services being developed on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as effectively as competitive offerings in addition the markets for our products or services or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate we or our customers suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences due to the design complexity of our products we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products any delays could result in increased development costs or divert resources from other projects if we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new products services and technologies our competitors may develop competing technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products or services the possibility also exists that our competitors might develop new technology or offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we operate in a competitive environment and our profitability depends on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services 

our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our quotations and bids are based upon among other items the cost to provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a new equipment order or the extent of required maintenance pursuant to a service contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform in accordance

our debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences we may need additional debt or equity financing in the future to meet our capital needs and such financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all due to changes in global capital markets our financial performance or outlook or our credit ratings and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 

as of december 31 2020 we had 53 billion outstanding longterm debt on a consolidated basis and approximately 701 million of shortterm debt our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including among others 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which would reduce funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and reinvestment in our businesses 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and 

• exposing us to interest rate risk because a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates 

we may need additional financing for general corporate purposes for example we may need funds to increase our investment in research and development activities to refinance or repay existing debt or to make a strategic acquisition we may be unable to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all volatility in the world financial markets including as a result of the covid19 pandemic could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets our ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or services or in the solvency of our customers suppliers or distributors or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions 

otis has been issued an investment grade credit rating from each of moody’s investor services inc and standard  poor’s there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or similar announcement could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur reduce market capacity for our commercial paper require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts or otherwise have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to the capital markets 

if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest and if we raise additional funds by issuing debt we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants 

quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases if commenced may be discontinued accelerated or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of common stock 

quarterly cash dividends are a component of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with operating free cash flow borrowings and divestitures we also have authority to repurchase our shares under a share repurchase program which we have not exercised as of december 31 2020 in general dividends and share repurchases if commenced may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice furthermore the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions the price of common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance longterm shareholder value shortterm stock price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth our due diligence reviews in connection with our acquisitions may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” antitrust anticollusion or other anticorruption laws in nonus jurisdictions we also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges as well as expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we may incur unexpected costs associated with labor law tax or pension matters or to bring acquired assets up to our operating standards we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations applying our internal controls to these acquired businesses or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses 

we also make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees other financial arrangements continued supply and services arrangements and environmental and product liability claims following the transaction under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flows results of operations or financial condition

our business and financial performance depend on continued substantial investment in information technology infrastructure which may not yield anticipated benefits and may be adversely affected by cyberattacks on information technology infrastructure and products and other business disruptions 

the efficient operation of our business will require continued substantial investment in technology infrastructure systems including shifting from virtual private networks to cloudbased networks and we must attract and retain qualified people to operate these systems expand and improve them integrate new systems effectively and efficiently convert to new systems when required an inability to fund acquire and implement these systems might impact our ability to respond effectively to changing customer expectations manage our business scale our solutions effectively or impact our customer service levels which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our financial results repeated or prolonged interruptions of service due to problems with our systems or thirdparty technologies whether or not in our control could have a significant negative impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services furthermore we are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business failure to design develop and implement new technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to adequately invest in and maintain these systems could result in the diversion of management’s attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results competitive position and ability to efficiently manage our business our existing information systems may become obsolete requiring us to transition our systems to a new platform such a transition could be time consuming costly and damaging to our competitive position and could require additional management resources failure to implement and deploy new systems or replacement systems on the schedules anticipated could materially adversely affect our operating results see “risk factors—risks related to the separation” below for a discussion of risks associated with transitioning our it infrastructure systems under the tsa

risks related to our common stock 

antitakeover provisions could enable our board of directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareholders 

otis’ amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with otis’ board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 1 the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on otis’ board of directors except in an instance where a director is removed by shareholders and the resulting vacancy is filled by shareholders 2 limitations on shareholders’ ability to call a special shareholder meeting 3 rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings and 4 the right of otis’ board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 

in addition we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with persons that acquire more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock 

we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with otis’ board of directors and by providing otis’ board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make otis immune from takeovers however these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that otis’ board of directors determines is not in the best interests of otis and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or issuance of our stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the internal revenue code code causing the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation to be taxable to rtx under the tma we would be required to indemnify rtx for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our shareholders may consider favorable 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the state courts within the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against otis and our directors and officers 

otis’ amended and restated bylaws provide that unless otis’ board of directors otherwise determines the state courts within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of otis any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of otis to otis or its shareholders including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against otis or any current or former director or officer or other employee of otis arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws any action asserting a claim relating to or involving otis governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action 

table of contents 

asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in section 115 of the dgcl 

to the fullest extent permitted by law this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims including claims under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act although otis shareholders will not be deemed to have waived otis’ compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with claims subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable 

this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with otis or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against otis and our directors and officers alternatively if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to the separation 

our historical information is not necessarily indicative of the results that we will achieve as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical information in this form 10k and our 2020 annual report for the periods prior to the separation is derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of our former parent utc and is based on a number of estimates and assumptions accordingly such historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we will achieve as a separate publicly traded company prior to the separation our business had been operated by utc as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company as part of our former parent utc we were able to enjoy certain benefits from utc’s operating diversity purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with utc’s other businesses additionally utc or one of its affiliates performed or helped perform various corporate functions for us such as accounting auditing tax legal human resources investor relations risk management treasury and other general and administrative functions our historical and pro forma financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from utc for such functions which are likely to be less than the expenses we will incur as a separate publicly traded company in addition the diversification of our sales costs and cash flows have diminished as a standalone company such that our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments and service debt may be diminished and we are no longer able to use cash flow from utcs other businesses as part of its centralized cash management systems to fund our investments and operations accordingly for these reasons as well as the additional risks related to the separation noted below we may not achieve the expected benefits of the separation 

as a result of the separation certain members of management directors and shareholders may own stock in rtx otis and carrier  and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest 

management and directors of each of rtx otis and carrier may own common stock in all three companies as a result of the separation this ownership overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other two companies for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and otis’ relationship with rtx and carrier thereafter 

we could experience temporary interruptions in business operations and incur additional costs as we further develop information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our standalone systems 

we are in the process of finalizing development of an it infrastructure and systems to support our critical business functions including accounting and reporting in order to replace many of the systems and functions our former parent utc previously provided or currently provides under the tsa we may experience temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot transition effectively to our own standalone systems and functions which could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our profitability

under current us federal income tax law a spinoff that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its shareholders as a result of certain postspinoff transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the spunoff corporation to preserve the taxfree treatment of the separation and in addition to otis’ indemnity obligation described below the tma restricts us for the twoyear period following the separation except in specific circumstances from 1 entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of otis stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 2 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 3 repurchasing shares of otis stock other than in certain openmarket transactions and 4 ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses the tma also prohibits us from taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the separation and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code or for applicable nonus income tax purposes further the tma imposes similar restrictions on us and our subsidiaries during the twoyear period following the separation that are intended to prevent certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization from failing to qualify as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code or for applicable nonus income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business 

in connection with the separation each of rtx otis and carrier agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities if we are required to pay under these indemnities to rtx andor carrier our financial results could be negatively impacted also the rtx or carrier indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which rtx and carrier are allocated responsibility and rtx andor carrier may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement the tma and the ema each party agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide rtx andor carrier are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that rtx andor carrier has agreed to retain the indemnities from rtx and carrier for our benefit may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and rtx andor carrier may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to such indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from rtx or carrier as applicable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

if the separation together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock or the stock of rtx we as well as rtx carrier and rtxs shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities in addition if certain internal restructuring transactions were to fail to qualify as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal or nonus income tax purposes we as well as rtx and carrier could be subject to significant tax liabilities in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify rtx for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tma 

in connection the separation our former parent utc received a ruling from the irs regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the separation under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and rely on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of utc and rtx otis and carrier including those relating to the past and future conduct of utc and rtx otis and carrier notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the separation andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs ruling or the opinion of counsel was based were inaccurate or have not been complied with in addition the irs ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the separation together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding 

table of contents 

receipt by utc of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the separation andor certain related transactions did not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 

if the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes rtx would recognize a taxable gain as if it had sold the common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and rtx shareholders who received common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares even if the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation were to otherwise qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code it may result in taxable gain to rtx but not its shareholders under section 355e of the code if the separation were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest by vote or value in rtx or otis for this purpose any acquisitions of rtx or otis shares within the period beginning two years before the distribution of common stock pursuant to the separation and ending two years after such distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although rtx or otis may be able to rebut that presumption including by qualifying for one or more safe harbors under applicable treasury regulations 

in addition in connection with and prior to the separation utc and its subsidiaries completed various internal reorganization transactions with respect to certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization utc obtained tax rulings in certain nonus jurisdictions andor opinions of external tax advisors in each case regarding the tax treatment of such transactions such tax rulings and opinions were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations including with respect to certain valuation matters relating to the internal reorganization statements and undertakings of utc and rtx otis carrier or their respective subsidiaries if any of these representations or statements were or become inaccurate or incomplete or if rtx otis carrier or any of their respective subsidiaries do not fulfill or otherwise comply with any such undertakings or covenants such tax rulings andor opinions may be invalid or the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized further notwithstanding receipt of any such tax rulings andor opinions there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant transactions differs from the conclusions reached in the relevant tax rulings andor opinions in the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant transaction we as well as rtx and carrier could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

under the tma otis generally is required to indemnify rtx and carrier for any taxes resulting from the separation and certain related transactions and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from 1 an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of otis whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition 2 other actions or failures to act by otis or 3 certain of otis’ representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated further under the tma we generally are required to indemnify rtx and carrier for a specified portion of any taxes and any related costs and other damages a arising as a result of the failure of the separation and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree including as a result of section 355e of the code or a failure of any internal separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree to so qualify in each case to the extent such amounts do not result from a disqualifying action by or acquisition of equity securities of otis carrier or rtx or b arising from an adjustment pursuant to an audit or other tax proceeding with respect to any transaction undertaken in connection with the separation that is not intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree any such indemnity obligations could be material 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation our former parent utc undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which including the separation of otis may be subject to various fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation 1 was insolvent was rendered insolvent by reason of the separation or had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital and 2 received less than fair consideration in connection with the reorganization or intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured then the court could void the separation in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareholders to return to rtx some or all of the shares of the common stock issued in the distribution or require rtx or otis as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency would vary 

table of contents 

depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities including the probable amount of contingent liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that otis or any of its subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the distribution
