business and macroeconomic environment 

the covid19 pandemic initially resulted in a global disruption in economic activity by adversely affecting production creating supply chain and market disruption and adversely impacting businesses and individuals however in the second half of fiscal 2021 business conditions were unexpectedly strong as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the pandemic in response to global supply constraints we worked to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business by qualifying alternative suppliers increasing our inventory of raw materials ramping our internal factories and adding assembly and test capacity to increase our manufacturing capability while securing additional capacity with our subcontractors wherever possible however strong customer demand outpaced capacity improvements in fiscal 2022 as we continued to experience constraints in our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains we expect that certain supply chain constraints will persist through calendar 2022 and into calendar 2023 in order to provide prioritized capacity to our customers we launched our preferred supply program in february 2021 which provides our customers with prioritized capacity beginning six months after the customer places an order for 12 months of continuous noncancellable and nonreschedulable backlog 

in response to the pandemic we have taken proactive preventative measures to enable a safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites while our global manufacturing sites are fully operational we strategically implemented plans intended to provide more assurance of business continuity in the event severe outbreaks or government requirements were to impact our operations

market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

microcontroller development tools 

  

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program our microcontroller and microprocessor products for specific applications and we believe they are an important factor for facilitating design wins 

  

our family of development tools for our microcontroller and microprocessor products range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler or a compiler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation capability we also offer a complete suite of compilers software code configurators and simulators customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future microcontroller devices in our portfolio 

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our microcontroller and microprocessor product architectures including an extensive amount of thirdparty tool suppliers whose products support our microcontroller architectures 

  

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of development tools from microchip as well as from thirdparty development tool partners by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of microsemi and other companies that outsourced all or substantial portions of their manufacturing we comply with several quality systems including iso9001 2015 version iatf16949 2016 version as9100 2016 version and tl9000 

refer to item 2 properties for further information regarding the location and principal operations of our manufacturing facilities 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 025 microns to 10 microns processes during fiscal 2022 we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 013 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes during fiscal 2022 we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 is being brought on line to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs 

fab 5 currently manufactures discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products 

we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 will allow us to respond to future demand of internally fabricated products with incremental capital expenditures 

as a result of our acquisition of microsemi we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture we currently plan to continue to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational with the exception of the facility in santa clara california which we closed in fiscal 2022 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries as a result of our acquisitions we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2022 approximately 60 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

assembly and test 

  

we perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world during fiscal 2022 we increased capacity at our thailand and philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2022 approximately 59 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our internal facilities and approximately 64 of our test requirements were performed in internal facilities we 

use thirdparty assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements over time we intend to continue to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our internal facilities 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory refer to note 3 for a summary of our longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment and rightofuse assets by geography 

  

we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors that provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our cems eses and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team eses also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

for information regarding our revenue results of operations and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years refer to our financial statements included in this form 10k 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 we derived 48 and 50 respectively of our net sales through distributors compared to 52 and 50 respectively of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us the decrease in the distribution percentage of our total net sales was primarily due to lower preferred supply program participation among our distributors as priority of supply under the preferred supply program is more prevalent with direct customers no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021 

  

with the exception of orders placed under our preferred supply program we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has historically been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

• performance 

• analog digital and mixed signal functionality and level of functional integration 

• field programmability 

• memory density 

• low power consumption 

• extended voltage ranges 

• reliability 

• security and functional safety 

• packaging alternatives 

• comprehensive suite of development tools 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

• ease of use 

• functionality of application development systems 

• hardware software and tool compatibility within product families to increase migration flexibility 

• dependable delivery quality and availability 

• technical and innovative service and support 

• time to market 

• price 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates from 2022 through 2041 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain inbound and outbound intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past 

infringement could be avoided licensees of our technology may become unable to pay and have in the past and are currently disputing their obligations to pay us royalties or fees litigation arbitration or other proceedings which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management has been and is expected to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses the necessity of engaging in defensive legal proceedings or any negative results of these proceedings could harm our business 

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could result in an increase in capital expenditures such as acquiring costly equipment or other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations technological changes or weather our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

human capital resources 

our employees 

we invest in our highlyskilled global workforce of approximately 21000 people in accordance with our guiding value employees are our greatest strength we believe that our culture values and organizational development and training programs provide an inclusive work environment where our employees are empowered and engaged to deliver the best embedded control solutions to our customers

risks related to our business operations and industry 

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

• general economic industry public health or political conditions in the us or internationally including uncertain economic conditions in china or the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and its implications 

• disruptions in our business our supply chain or our customers businesses due to public health concerns including viral outbreaks such as covid19 cybersecurity incidents terrorist activity armed conflict war including russias invasion of the ukraine worldwide oil prices and supply fires natural disasters or disruptions in the transportation system

• rising interest rates or inflation and 

• property damage or other losses whether or not covered by insurance 

periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock uncertain global economic and public health conditions such as the covid19 pandemic have caused and may in the future cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparisons between periods less meaningful 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers any downturn in global or regional economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic the enactment of broad sanctions by the us or other countries against russia or risks of rising interest rates or inflation may adversely impact their financial viability the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our inability to collect our accounts receivable balances higher allowances for credit losses and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales 

we may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers needs increase prices or are impacted by increases in tariffs 

our manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources for these supplies but there may be a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting our standards we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time to fill our orders that they cannot fill certain orders that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or parts or that they are increasing prices in particular in fiscal 2022 we experienced increased prices at certain suppliers and longer lead times for some assembly raw materials required for production purposes such conditions are expected to continue an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business the supplies necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors increases or due to supply chain disruptions or political instability additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them also the reduced availability of necessary labor the impact of the covid19 pandemic or the application of sanctions trade restrictions or tariffs by the us or other countries may adversely impact the industry supply chain for example in 2019 the us government increased tariffs on us imports with china as their country of origin likewise the china government increased tariffs on china imports with us as their country of origin we have taken steps to attempt to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not significantly increase the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china will increase our costs and could have an adverse impact on our operating results in future periods we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our operations this could also impair sourcing flexibility 

our customers may also be adversely affected by these same issues the labor supplies and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers reduced availability of labor consolidation in their supply chain the impact of the covid19 pandemic or sanctions trade restrictions or tariffs that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs if our customers are not able to produce their products then their need for our products will decrease such interruptions of our customers’ businesses could harm our business 

we do not purchase significant amounts of equipment from russia belarus or the ukraine however the semiconductor industry and purchasers of semiconductors use raw materials that are sourced from these regions such as neon palladium and nickel if we or our direct or indirect customers are unable to obtain the requisite raw materials or components needed to manufacture products our ability to manufacture products or demand for our products may be adversely impacted this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while there has been an adverse impact on the world’s palladium and neon supply chains at this time our palladium and neon supply chains have been able to meet our needs while sales of our products into the regions and to customers that sell into these regions have been negatively impacted by the russian invasion of the ukraine at this time we have not experienced a material impact on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors as are our superflash and other licensees 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 approximately 60 and 61 respectively of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries we also use several contractors located primarily in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products specifically during fiscal 2022 approximately 41 of our assembly requirements and 36 of our test requirements were performed by thirdparty contractors compared to approximately 47 of our assembly requirements and 43 of our test requirements during fiscal 2021 due to increased demand for our products we have taken actions in recent quarters to increase our capacity allocation from our wafer fabrication assembly and test subcontractors however we expect foundry capacity to continue to be limited due to strong demand for wafers across the industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the necessary allocation of capacity from our wafer foundries and other contractors further additional capacity with the ability to manufacture the process technologies that we need or that such capacity will be available on acceptable terms as our manufacturing subcontractors move to more advanced process technologies over time we may find that they do not invest in some of the trailing edge process technologies on which a large portion of our products are manufactured if this occurs it may limit the amounts of net sales that we can achieve or require us to make significant investments to be able to manufacture these products in our own facilities or at other foundries and assembly and testing contractors we expect that our reliance on thirdparty contractors may increase over time as our business grows and any inability to secure necessary external capacity could adversely affect our operating results 

our use of third parties reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if a significant contractor were to experience production difficulties insufficient capacity decreased manufacturing reduced availability of labor assembly and test yields or increased costs due to disruptions from the covid19 pandemic political upheaval or infrastructure disruption additionally our future operating results could suffer if our wafer foundries and other contractors increase the prices of the products and services that they provide to us some of our subcontractors in china experienced production difficulties due to covid19 related disruptions in march 2022 but this did not have a significant impact on our operating results if third parties do not timely deliver products or services in accordance with our quality standards we may be unable to qualify alternate manufacturing sources in a timely manner or on favorable terms or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon processes that we need or fail to adopt technologies that we desire to control costs in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further use of subcontractors increases the risks of misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees rely on wafer foundries if our licensees experienced disruption in supply at such foundries this would reduce the revenue from our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales suppliers and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2022 approximately 78 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 22 in china and 15 in taiwan during fiscal 2021 approximately 77 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 22 in china and 16 in taiwan 

a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy although our sales in the chinese market have been strong in recent quarters competition in china is intense and chinas economic growth has been projected to slow in calendar 2022 in the past economic weakness in the chinese market adversely impacted our sales volumes in china as discussed above the trade relationship between the us and china remains challenging economic conditions in china remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods additionally the impact of covid19 related lockdowns in the first quarter of calendar 2022 has adversely impacted chinese customers and the supply chain weakening of foreign markets could result in lower demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities and finished goods warehouses near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability and severe flooding in the past there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we have a test facility in calamba philippines we use foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements 

we do not have significant sales or operations in russia belarus or the ukraine and we do not purchase significant amounts of equipment from these regions however the semiconductor industry and purchasers of semiconductors use raw materials that are sourced from these regions such as neon palladium and nickel if we or our direct or indirect customers are unable to obtain the requisite raw materials or components needed to manufacture products our ability to manufacture products or demand for our products may be adversely impacted this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while there has been an adverse impact on the world’s palladium and neon supply chains due to the russia ukraine conflict at this time our palladium and neon supply chains have been able to meet our needs while sales of our products into the regions impacted by the russia ukraine conflict and to customers that sell into these regions have been negatively impacted by the russian invasion of the ukraine at this time we have not experienced a material impact on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

• political social and economic instability due to the covid19 pandemic or other factors 

• trade restrictions and changes in tariffs 

• supply chain disruptions or delays 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

• economic uncertainty in the worldwide markets served by us 

• import and export license requirements and restrictions 

• changes in laws related to taxes environmental health and safety technical standards and consumer protection 

• currency fluctuations and foreign exchange regulations 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• employment regulations 

• disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents 

• disruptions in international transport or delivery 

• public health conditions including viral outbreaks such as covid19 and 

• difficulties in collecting receivables and longer payment cycles 

if any of these risks occur or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer we could face an increase in the cost of components production delays business interruptions delays in obtaining export licenses tariffs and other restrictions longer payment cycles increased taxes restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

we depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and have limited visibility to product shipments other than orders placed under our preferred supply program 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders that are both received and shipped in the same quarter which we call turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically our ability to respond quickly to customer orders has been part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our visibility on future shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times although our backlog has been very strong in recent periods due to favorable industry conditions and the impact of our preferred supply program turns orders remain important to our ability to meet our business objectives because turns orders can be difficult to predict especially in times of economic volatility where customers may change order levels within the quarter varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales the level of turns orders may also decrease in periods where customers are holding excess inventory of our products our customers may have increased their order levels in previous periods to help ensure they have sufficient inventory of our products to meet their needs or they may have been unable to sell their products at their forecasted levels as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets or effectively manage our production based on changes in order forecasts our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

in february 2021 we announced our preferred supply program which offers our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity to participate in the program customers have to place 12 months of orders which cannot be cancelled or rescheduled except in the event of price increases the capacity priority began for shipments in july 2021 the program is not a guarantee of supply however it will provide the highest priority for those orders which are under this program and the capacity priority will be on a firstcome firstserved basis until the available capacity is booked a significant portion of our capacity is booked under this new program we believe this program will enable us to be in a stronger position to make capacity and raw material commitments to our suppliers buy capital equipment with confidence hire employees and ramp up manufacturing and manufacture products more efficiently since this is a new program there can be no assurance that the program will be successful or that it will benefit our business in the event that customers under this program attempt to cancel or reschedule orders we may have to take legal or other action to enforce the terms of the program and any such actions could result in damage to our customer relationships or cause us to incur significant costs additionally as orders under this program cannot be cancelled or returned except in the event of price increases this may result in customers holding excess inventory of our products and thus decrease their need to place new orders in later periods 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and faces price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue product offerings and scale we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including but not limited to 

• the relative impact of the covid19 pandemic on us relative to our competitors 

• changes in demand in the markets that we serve and the overall rate of growth or contraction of such markets including but not limited to the automotive personal computing and consumer electronics markets 

• our ability to obtain adequate foundry and assembly and test capacity and supplies at acceptable prices 

• our ability to ramp production and increase capacity at our wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities 

• the quality performance reliability features ease of use pricing and diversity of our products 

• our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies 

• the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their applications and the success of such applications 

• the rate at which the markets that we serve redesign and change their own products 

• product introductions by our competitors 

• the number nature and success of our competitors in a given market 

• our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights 

• our ability to address the needs of our customers and 

• general market and economic conditions 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of a product the average selling prices of our microcontroller fpga products and proprietary products in our analog product line have remained relatively constant over time while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary products in our analog product line have declined over time the overall average selling price of our products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period 

we have experienced and may experience in the future modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions at this time we are not experiencing these types of pricing declines due to favorable industry conditions and demand in the past we have moderated average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices however we may not be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary products in our analog product line at this time we are not experiencing these types of pricing declines due to favorable industry conditions and demand in fiscal 2022 we experienced cost increases which we were able to pass on to our customers however in the future we may be unable to maintain average selling prices due to increased pricing pressure which could adversely impact our operating results 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

integrated circuits manufacturing processes are complex and sensitive to many factors including contaminants in the 

manufacturing environment or materials used the performance of our personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue and penalties for failure to meet shipment deadlines our operating results are adversely affected when we operate below normal capacity in fiscal 2022 we operated at above normal capacity levels and we expect this to continue if the current supply constraints relative to demand continue in fiscal 2021 we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of 296 million 

our operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand historically since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business generates stronger revenues in the first half and comparatively weaker revenues in the second half of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions including the impact of continued strong demand in the industry the covid19 pandemic or trade tensions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition of microsemi have had and can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality in periods when broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonality on our business the semiconductor industry has had significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers 

sales to distributors accounted for approximately 48 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and approximately 50 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 with the exception of orders placed under our preferred supply program we do not have longterm purchase agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

future adverse conditions in the us or global economies and labor markets including the impact of the covid19 pandemic or credit markets could materially impact distributor operations any deterioration in the financial condition or disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn there may be an oversupply and decrease in demand for our products which could reduce our net sales in a given period and increase inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

• effective new product selection 

• timely completion and introduction of new product designs 

• availability of skilled employees 

• procurement of licenses for intellectual property rights from third parties under commercially reasonable terms 

• timely filing and protection of intellectual property rights for new product designs 

• availability of development and support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and 

• market acceptance of our customers end products 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and others in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in transitioning to advanced 

process technologies and have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

business interruptions to our operations or those of our key vendors licensees or customers could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors licensees or customers may be disrupted due to public health concerns including outbreaks such as covid19 work stoppages or reduction in available labor power loss insufficient water cyber attacks computer network compromises incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination or fire earthquake floods droughts volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that we will avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a business interruption for example in fiscal 2022 covid19 related restrictions adversely impacted our manufacturing operations in the us philippines and thailand along with our subcontractors manufacturing operations in malaysia taiwan and china similar challenges arose for our logistics service providers which adversely impacted their ability to ship product to our customers the pandemic could adversely impact our business in future periods if the impact of covid19 becomes more severe in the future local governments could require us to reduce production cease operations at any of our facilities or implement mandatory vaccine requirements and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders 

additionally operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in april and may 2020 we received a greater number of order cancellations and requests by our customers to reschedule deliveries to future dates some customers requested order cancellations within our firm order window and claimed applicability of force majeure clauses likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline 

also thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to timely shift production to other facilities and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment business interruptions would likely cause delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not compensate us for any losses or damages and business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop such technologies and to introduce new technologies to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

• proper identification of licensee requirements 

• timely development and introduction of new or enhanced technology 

• our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights for our licensed technology 

• our ability to limit our liability and indemnification obligations to licensees 

• availability of development and support services to assist licensees in their design and manufacture of products 

• availability of foundry licensees with sufficient capacity to support oem production and 

• market acceptance of our customers end products 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or reduced production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive our technology license agreements generally include a clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from certain intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management these issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

reliance on sales into governmental projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a significant portion of the sales of microsemi which we acquired in may 2018 are from or are derived from government agencies or customers who sell to us government agencies such sales are subject to uncertainties regarding governmental spending levels spending priorities regulatory and policy changes future sales into us government projects are subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities including the budgetary process changes in the timing and spending priorities the impact of any past or future government shutdowns contract terminations or renegotiations future sequestrations changes in regulations that we must comply with to be eligible to accept new contracts such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification requirements and mandatory vaccine requirements or the impact of the covid19 pandemic for example in fiscal 2022 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we experienced suspensions and stop work orders for some of our subcontracts although such actions have not yet had a material adverse impact on our business there can be no assurance as to the future costs or implications of such actions sales into government projects are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary regulatory tax and trade policies implemented by current or future administrations or by the us congress 

in the past microsemi has experienced delays and reductions in appropriations on programs that included its products for example in 2018 there were two federal government shutdowns further delays reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the us federal government could materially and adversely affect our operating results if the us government fails to complete its annual budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations another federal government shutdown may occur during which we may experience further delays reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts which could materially and adversely affect our operating results while we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions further changes in us government procurement regulations and practices particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs or increase compliance obligations such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification and mandatory vaccine requirements may adversely impact the contracting environment our ability to hire and retain employees and our operating results 

the us government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with us at any time for example in 2014 the us government terminated a 75 million contract with microsemi uncertainty in government spending and termination of contracts for government related projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenue from our microsemi acquisition our contracts with us governmental agencies or prime customers require us to comply with the contract terms and governmental regulations particularly for our facilities systems and personnel that service such customers to be awarded new contracts we may be required to meet certain levels of the cybersecurity maturity model certification that we may not meet or choose to meet complying with these regulations including audit requirements requires that we devote significant resources to such matters in terms of training personnel information technology and facilities any failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and penalties or loss of current or future business that may materially and adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we receive grants from governments agencies and research organizations if we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits and recognize related charges which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

from time to time we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment at specific locations the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive headcount capital and research and development expenditures and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments noncompliance with the conditions of the grants could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses in may 2018 we acquired microsemi which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever integration of our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies we may not realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems it may be difficult to develop manufacture and market the products of a newly 

acquired company or grow the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction in particular in connection with our microsemi and atmel acquisitions we became involved with thirdparty claims litigation governmental investigations and disputes related to such businesses and transactions see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding such matters acquisitions may also result in charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional sharebased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results to fund our acquisition of microsemi we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately 810 billion of additional debt we may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our revolving credit facility raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business it may be difficult to find or complete divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies which may include site closures timely or on acceptable terms these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to the desired divestiture or the price or terms of the divestiture may be less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture or other exit strategy we may have certain continuing obligations to former employees customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing liabilities related to former employees assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

as a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets 

when we acquire a business a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired as of march 31 2022 we had goodwill of 667 billion and net intangible assets of 404 billion in connection with the completion of our acquisition of microsemi in may 2018 our goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly we review our indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022 we recognized 30 million of intangible asset impairment charges no intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2021 if in future periods we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control and remediate any future control deficiencies our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results our ability to operate our business and our reputation with investors 

we have in the past identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to it system access although such material weaknesses were remediated in fiscal 2020 there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in the future if we cannot remediate future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses our ability to accurately record process and report financial information and our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements subject us to 

litigation and investigations negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets 

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap we are required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors in addition to the identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to it system access which were remediated as of march 31 2020 we have from time to time identified other significant deficiencies if we fail to remediate any future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers require that we implement practices that are more stringent than those required by applicable laws with respect to labor requirements the materials contained in our products energy efficiency environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we also require our suppliers to adopt such practices our suppliers may in the future refuse to implement these practices or may charge us more for complying with them if certain of our suppliers refuse to implement the practices we may be forced to source from alternate suppliers the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we do not implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing enforcing and auditing customerrequested practices at our own sites and in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require more personnel 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel has intensified 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel has intensified in recent periods in our industry due to high demand for skilled employees availability of labor is currently constrained in certain geographic markets in which we operate due to the tight and competitive labor market across our industry competition for available labor has intensified for a variety of reasons including the increase in workfrom home arrangements brought about by covid19 and the wage inflation in our industry 

our ability to attract and retain skilled employees such as management technical marketing sales research and development manufacturing and operational personnel is critical to our business we rely on a direct labor force at our manufacturing facilities any inability to maintain our labor force at our facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand and ultimately could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our inability to attract and retain hardware and software engineers and sales and marketing personnel could delay the development and introduction of and harm our ability to sell our products we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team and it is possible that they could leave with little or no notice which could make it more difficult for us to execute our planned business strategy our inability to retain attract or motivate personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance coverage related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations because we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to employee health matters certain property matters product defects cybersecurity matters employment risks environmental matters political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 

risks related to cybersecurity privacy intellectual property and litigation 

we continue to be the target of attacks on our it systems interruptions in and unauthorized access to our it systems or improper handling of data could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the uninterrupted operation of complex it systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business operations supply chain sales and operating results such disruption could result in an unauthorized release of our our suppliers’ or our customers’ intellectual property or confidential proprietary or sensitive information or the release of personal data any release of such information or data could harm our business or competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages in addition any release of such information or data or the failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of such information may result in regulatory inquiries or penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations claims for damages litigation and other sanctions 

we have experienced verifiable attacks on our it systems and data including network compromises attempts to breach our security measures and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems for example in fiscal 2019 we learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers we engaged outside legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such matters we took steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and in may 2019 we began implementing a containment plan we routinely evaluate the effectiveness of the containment mechanisms that were implemented and continue to implement additional measures we have analyzed the information that was compromised we do not believe that this it system compromise has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us as a result of the it system compromise our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our internal controls related to it system access were not effective resulting in a material weakness in our internal controls for fiscal 2019 although this material weakness in our internal control was remediated in fiscal 2020 there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in future periods 

due to the types of products we sell and the significant amount of sales we make to government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to us government agencies we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in the future attacks on our it systems and data including attempts to breach our security network compromises and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems were any future attacks to be successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have regularly implemented improvements to our protective measures which include but are not limited to implementation of the following firewalls endpoint intrusion detection and response software regular patches log monitors event correlation tools network segmentation routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits dual factor identification data partitioning privileged account segregation and monitoring routine password modifications and an enhanced information security program including training classes and phishing exercises for employees and contractors with system access along with tabletop exercises conducted by information security personnel as a result of the material weakness in our internal controls resulting from the it systems compromise in fiscal 2019 we have taken remediation actions and implemented additional controls and we are continuing to take actions to attempt to address evolving threats however recent system improvements have not been fully effective in preventing attacks on our it systems and data including breaches of our security measures and there can be no assurance that any future system improvements will be effective in preventing future cyberattacks or disruptions or limiting the damage from any future cyberattacks or disruptions such system improvements have resulted in increased costs to us and any future improvements attacks or disruptions could result in additional costs related to rebuilding our internal systems defending litigation complaints or other claims providing notices to regulatory agencies or other third parties responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to portions of our and our customers data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such breach or loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

our failure to comply with federal state or international privacy and data protection laws and regulations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and internationally regarding privacy and data protection such as the european union’s eu general data protection regulation gdpr the uk equivalent to the gdpr the california consumer privacy act and the california privacy rights act the scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions some of these laws create a broad definition of personal information establish data privacy rights impose data breach notification requirements and create potentially severe statutory damages frameworks and private rights of action for certain data breaches some of the laws and regulations also place restrictions on our ability to collect store use transmit and process personal information and other data across our business for example the gdpr restricts the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area eea to the us and other countries further such laws and regulations have resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies such as us that have employees customers and operations in the eea 

in order to comply with the gdpr we have relied mainly on the european commission’s standard contractual clauses sccs for transfers of personal information from the eea to the us or other countries however the court of justice of the eu in a july 2020 decision schrems ii invalidated the euus privacy shield framework and also called for stricter conditions in the use of the sccs following the schrems ii decision certain data protection authorities in the eu have issued statements advising companies within their jurisdiction not to transfer personal data to the us under the sccs at present there are few if any viable alternatives to the sccs if we are unable to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure that our transfers of personal information from the eea are lawful we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions and substantial fines and injunctions against processing personal information from the eea the loss of our ability to lawfully transfer personal data out of the eea may cause reluctance or refusal by european customers to communicate with us as they are currently and we may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in the eea at significant expense additionally other countries outside of the eea have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency which could increase the cost and complexity of providing our products in those jurisdictions 

furthermore the gdpr and the uk equivalent of the gdpr expose us to two parallel data protection regimes in europe each of which potentially authorizes fines and enforcement actions for certain violations substantial fines may be imposed for breaches of data protection requirements which can be up to 4 of a company’s worldwide revenue or 20 million euros whichever is greater although the uk data protection regime currently permits data transfers from the uk to the eea and other third countries covered by a european commission adequacy decision through the continued use of sccs and binding corporate rules these laws and regulations are subject to change and any such changes could have adverse implications for our transfer of personal data from the uk to the eea and other third countries 

while we plan to continue to undertake efforts to conform to current regulatory obligations and evolving best practices such efforts may be unsuccessful or result in significant costs we may also experience reluctance or refusal by european or multinational customers to continue to provide us with personal data due to the potential risk exposure of personal data transfers and the current data protection obligations imposed on them by applicable data protection laws or by certain data protection authorities these and any other data privacy laws and their interpretations continue to develop and their uncertainty and inconsistency may increase the cost of compliance cause compliance challenges restrict our ability to offer products in certain locations in the same way that we have been potentially adversely affect certain thirdparty service providers or subject us to sanctions by data protection regulators all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings investigations or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings investigations or claims regarding intellectual property rights product failures our microsemi acquisition contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us our direct or indirect customers or our licensees these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless have in the past and could in the future result in substantial costs to us if we are unable to resolve or settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms reengineer products or processes to avoid infringement provide a costeffective remedy or successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take a charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries economic damage or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our or our customer’s specifications changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

• costs related to writing off the value of our inventory of nonconforming products 

• recalling nonconforming products 

• providing support services product replacements or modifications to products and the defense of such claims 

• diversion of resources from other projects 

• lost revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders or unpaid receivables 

• customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements and 

• a requirement to pay damages or penalties 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the revenue and profits we received while we exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by law we have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will fully protect against such claims payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace defense safety security and medical where failure of the application could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

our contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities 

with the exception of orders placed under our preferred supply program we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our nondistributor customers and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts other than under our preferred supply program the contract is generally cancelable based on standard terms and conditions under our preferred supply program customers may cancel contracts in the event of price increases while we had approximately 124000 customers and our ten largest direct customers accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 and five of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits for example due to uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic we experienced an increase in order cancellations and requests to reschedule deliveries to future dates in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

certain customer contracts differ from our standard terms of sale for some of the markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our customers may have negotiating leverage over us as a result of their market size for example under certain contracts we have committed to supply products on scheduled delivery dates or extended our obligations for liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as contractually required the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to delays in their manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for costs and damages associated with customer claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay associated legal fees while we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions manage the risks of such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we are unable to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have and may in the future have to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement or product failure this exposes us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products sold under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive under such contracts or potential consequential damages further where we do not have negotiated customer contracts our customers order terms may govern the transaction and contain terms unfavorable to us these risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive 

and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that are issued may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a thirdparty could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful 

risks related to taxation laws and regulations 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products or import supplies could levy fines restrict or delay our ability to export products or import supplies or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products 

a significant portion of our sales require export and import activities our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to laws and regulations on international trade including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act ears international traffic in arms regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities including those administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control licenses or license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries our inability to timely obtain a license for any reason including a delay in license processing due to a federal government shutdown like that which occurred in 2018 could cause a delay in scheduled shipments which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue within the quarter of a shutdown and in following quarters depending on the extent that license processing is delayed further determination by a government that we have failed to comply with trade regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines penalties and seizure of products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings a change in laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries customers distributors or others for example in february 2022 the us began implementing widescale sanctions against russia due to russias invasion of the ukraine sanctions against belarus and certain ukraine regions were later implemented because the actions by russia against the ukraine are in conflict with our guiding values microchip chose to cease shipments into russia and belarus and we will continue to comply with applicable us sanctions regarding ukraine while sales of our products into these regions and to customers that sell into these regions have been negatively impacted at this time we have not experienced a material adverse impact on our revenue an additional example occurred in april 2018 when the us commerce department banned us companies from selling products or transferring technology to zte a chinese company and certain subsidiaries this ban was lifted in july 2018 in fiscal 2020 when the us commerce department banned us companies from selling products or transferring technology to certain chinese companies including huawei and certain subsidiaries in fiscal 2020 the us federal acquisition regulation prohibited us governmental agencies from buying equipment using covered telecommunications equipment as a substantial component or critical technology where the technology came from certain chinese companies in july 2020 this was expanded to prohibit us governmental agencies from entering into a contract with any company that uses covered telecommunications equipment whether or not the chinese technology is related to the procurement effective june 2020 amendments to the ear regarding prohibitions of sales of items with a “military end use” into china russia and venezuela and belarus effective march 2021 and elimination of an ear license exception apply to more of our products than the previous regulations any of the foregoing changes could adversely impact our operational costs due to the administrative impacts of complying with these regulations and may limit those with whom we conduct business any one or more of these sanctions future sanctions a change in laws or regulations or a prohibition on shipment of our products or transfer of our technology to significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the us and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods implemented trade restrictions and introduced national security protection policies trade tensions between the us and china which escalated in 2018 have 

continued and include the us increasing tariffs on chinese origin goods and china increasing tariffs on us origin goods we took steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business by making adjustments in operations and supply although these tariff increases did not result in a material adverse impact on our operating costs in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2020 they did reduce demand for our products during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 increased tariffs on our customers products could adversely impact their sales and increased tariffs on our products in comparison to those of our competitors could each result in lower demand for our products 

further changes in trade or national security protection policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or reduce our ability to sell products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

the outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our us and certain foreign income tax returns for fiscal 2007 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from current or future examinations there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates financial position and results of operations 

exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities changes in tax rules and regulations changes in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates financial condition and results of operations 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in many us and foreign jurisdictions our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors including changes to our operating structure intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies 

our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period our future effective tax rates financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries where we do business similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing income tax framework possibilities of a global minimum tax and proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue 

our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted by policies implemented globally by the current or future administrations 

the current administration in the us and administrations in other global jurisdictions in which we operate have indicated support for significant legislative and policy changes in areas including but not limited to tax trade labor and the environment if implemented these changes could increase our effective tax rate and increase our selling andor manufacturing costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions changes in tax policy trade regulations or other matters and any uncertainty surrounding the scope or timing of such changes could negatively impact the stock market and reduce the trading price of our stock for example in february 2022 the us began implementing widescale sanctions against russia due to russias invasion of the ukraine sanctions against belarus and certain ukraine regions were later implemented because the actions by russia against the ukraine are in conflict with our guiding values microchip chose to cease shipments into russia and belarus and we will continue to comply with applicable us sanctions regarding ukraine while sales of our products into these regions and to customers that sell into these regions have been negatively impacted at this time we have not experienced a material adverse impact on our revenue retaliatory acts by russia in response to the sanctions could include cyber attacks sanctions or other actions that could disrupt the economy as a result of the foregoing risks or similar risks the imposition of sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply or the failure of entities that we have acquired over time to have complied with regulations could result in significant fines liability for cleanup suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses environmental laws continue to expand with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products and shipping materials future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in the amount and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may have insufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may have to write off inventory if we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations we expect these risks to continue these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose risks that could harm our results of operations 

climate change regulations or voluntary actions we may have taken as part of our environmental social and governance initiatives could require us to limit emissions change manufacturing processes substitute materials which may cost more or be less available fund offset projects obtain new permits or undertake other costly activities failure to obtain required permits could result in fines suspension or cessation of production restrictions on emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs carbon taxes and emission cap and trade programs the cost of compliance with such regulations could restrict our manufacturing operations increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

the sec has recently proposed a rule entitled enhancement and standardization of climaterelated disclosures for investors while the proposed rule is not yet in effect and is subject to change as a result of the sec comment process if it were to go in effect in its current form we would incur significant additional costs of compliance due to the need for expanded data collection analysis and certification further certain elements of the proposed rule such as mandatory thirdparty verification of emissions may be difficult to comply with in the proposed required timeframe as there may be an insufficient number of qualified thirdparty verification entities to meet demand 

sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as utility shortages and higher costs of utilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions which some experts believe may become vulnerable to fires storms severe floods and droughts while our business recovery plans are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other disruptive events our plans may not protect us from all events 

customer demands and regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation and disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries we filed a form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 28 2021 other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that our supply chain is free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing customers may demand that we change the sourcing of materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant materials significantly increases or availability is limited if we change materials or suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing we have incurred and expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may be unable to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the responsible minerals initiative or the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act if we are unable to meet customer requirements customers may disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory if it cannot be sold 

in addition to concerns over “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo our customers may require that other minerals and substances used within our supply chain be evaluated and reported on an increase in reporting obligations will increase associated operating costs this could have negative effects on our overall operating profits 

a requirement to fund our foreign pension plans could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

in connection with our acquisitions of microsemi and atmel we assumed pension plans that cover certain french and german employees most of these plans are unfunded in compliance with statutory requirements and we have no immediate intention of funding these plans the projected benefit obligation totaled 746 million at march 31 2022 benefits are paid when amounts become due we expect to pay approximately 16 million in fiscal 2023 for benefits earned should regulations require funding of these plans in the future it could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

risks related to capitalization and financial markets 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the recent past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

• global economic and financial uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic or other factors 

• quarterly variations in our operating results or the operating results of other technology companies 

• changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance 

• changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance or buysell recommendations 

• general conditions in the semiconductor industry 

• the amount and timing of repurchases of shares of our common stock 

• our ability to realize the expected benefits of our completed or future acquisitions and 

• actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors 

in addition the stock market has recently and in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to their operating performance these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debt to decline or fluctuate substantially 

the amount and timing of our share repurchases may fluctuate in response to a variety of factors 

the amount timing and execution of repurchases of shares of our common stock may fluctuate based on the share price of our common stock general business and market conditions tax regulations impacting share repurchases and other factors including our operating results level of cash flow capital expenditures and dividend payments although our board of directors has authorized share repurchases of up to 400 billion the authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm shareholder value the repurchase authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and may affect the trading price of our common stock and increase volatility 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage current or future debt 

as of march 31 2022 the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 784 billion as a result of our acquisition of microsemi we have substantially more debt than we had prior to may 2018 at march 31 2022 we had 140 billion in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility which provides up to 275 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2026 at march 31 2022 we had 560 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes and 8381 million in aggregate principal of convertible debt outstanding 

our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance our current or future debt and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on reasonable terms if at all 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash we may not have sufficient cash to fund payments and adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal interest or to refinance our indebtedness including our outstanding convertible debt and senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic competitive and other factors including those related to the covid19 pandemic our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases or acquisitions if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to undertake alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on onerous or highly dilutive terms our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time our senior secured notes are rated by certain major credit rating agencies these credit ratings impact our cost of borrowing and our ability to access the capital markets and are based on our financial performance and financial metrics including debt levels there is no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of our credit rating by a major credit rating agency could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets to refinance our existing debt or finance future debt 

conversion of our convertible debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of such debt following our irrevocable settlement election made on april 1 2022 upon conversion we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to such converted convertible debt by delivering cash equal to the principal amount of such converted convertible debt and cash and shares of common stock or any combination at our option with respect to any conversion value in excess thereof ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the convertible debt as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible debt may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible debt could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the convertible debt into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results 

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when the value of a nonus currency significantly declines relative to the us dollar customers transacting in that currency may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar declines significantly relative to the british pound euro thai baht and taiwan dollar the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the us dollar will have on our business or results of operations

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for an overview of our business and recent trends refer to part i item 1 business 

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results we then discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources section generally discusses fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 for our discussion of our fiscal 2021 results compared to fiscal 2020 for both our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources sections refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 filed with the sec on may 18 2021 which is incorporated by reference herein 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general   

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes convertible debt and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and nondistributor customers direct customers and to a lesser extent from royalties paid by licensees of our intellectual property we apply the following fivestep approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition i identify the contract with the customer ii identify performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied 

sales to our distributors are governed by a distributor agreement a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to distributors do not meet the definition of a contract until the distributor has sent in a purchase order we have acknowledged the order we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created as is customary in the semiconductor industry we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors as these are forms of variable consideration we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method after the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations we recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with distributors is recognized at or near to the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the distributor 

sales to our direct customers are generally governed by a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to direct customers usually do not meet the definition of a contract until the direct customer has sent in a purchase order we have acknowledged the order and deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created generally the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable after the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations we recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied substantially all of the 

revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at or near to the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer 

revenue generated from our licensees is governed by licensing agreements our primary performance obligation related to these agreements is to provide the licensee the right to use the intellectual property the final transaction price is determined by multiplying the usage of the license by the royalty which is fixed in the licensing agreement revenue is recognized as usage of the license occurs 

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows under the acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2022 we have never recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we utilize rsus with a service condition as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees and also grant marketbased and performancebased psus to executive officers and employees sharebased compensation cost for rsus with a service condition or performancebased psus is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods we estimate the fair value of psus with a market condition using a monte carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility total sharebased compensation expense recognized during the fiscal 2022 was 2102 million of which 1759 million was reflected in operating expenses and 343 million was reflected in cost of sales total sharebased compensation included in our inventory was 75 million at march 31 2022 

if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating reserves for obsolescence we evaluate projected demand over periods that align with demand forecasts used to develop manufacturing plans and inventory build decisions and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of estimated demand management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales during fiscal 2022 we operated at above normal 

capacity levels during fiscal 2021 we operated at below normal capacity levels primarily due to general economic conditions and uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of 296 million 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

the accounting model related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement generally adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period that results in the position being effectively settled or if the statute of limitation expires due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model 

  

convertible debt 

  

upon issuance we separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt by estimating the fair values of the i liability component without a conversion feature and ii the conversion feature this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 

upon settlement of our convertible debt instruments we allocate the total consideration between the liability and equity components based on the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature the difference between the consideration allocated to the liability component and the net carrying value of the liability component is recognized as an extinguishment loss or gain the remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the equity component and recognized as a reduction of additional paidin capital in our consolidated balance sheets in addition if the terms of the settlement are different from the contractual terms of the original instrument we recognize an inducement loss which is measured as the difference between the fair value of the original terms of the instrument and the fair value of the settlement terms 

determining the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature upon issuance and settlement involves estimating the equivalent borrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible instrument given the values of these transactions fair value estimates are sensitive to changes in the equivalent borrowing rate conclusions the measurement of the equivalent borrowing rate requires that we make estimates of volatility and credit spreads to align observable market inputs with the instrument being valued 

lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the convertible debt in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts product liability customer claims governmental investigations and other matters additionally we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims although the outcomes are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation governmental investigations and disputes as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation governmental investigations or disputes in the future 

we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our matters and where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable which generally is based on a probability weighted model if fair value is not determinable contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit 

the following table summarizes our net sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 dollars in millions 



the increase in net sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to strong business conditions that began in the second half of fiscal 2021 as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the covid19 pandemic business conditions continued to be exceptionally strong in fiscal 2022 additionally semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain which we have been passing on to our customers in the form of price increases these price increases also contributed to the increase in net sales during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 our price increases were implemented at various times and in various amounts throughout fiscal 2022 with respect to our very broad range of customers and products due to the complexity of the implementation of the price increases and the changes in product geographic and customer mix we are not able to quantify the impact of the price increases on our net sales 

the net sales value of inventory at our distributor customers increased 112 million during fiscal 2022 compared to a decrease of 104 million during fiscal 2021 excluding the impact of changes in distributor inventory levels on net sales net sales increased by 250 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 our price increases positively impacted net sales during fiscal 2022 additionally demand for our products was positively impacted by strength in our microcontroller and analog product lines due to the size complexity and diversity of our customer base we are not able to quantify any material factor contributing to the change other than net demand fluctuations in the end markets that we serve 

other factors that we believe contributed to changes in our reported net sales for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and which are drivers of longterm trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include 

• semiconductor industry conditions 

• our various new product offerings that have increased our served available market 

• customers’ increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions and 

• increasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products through our total systems solutions 

we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were as follows dollars in millions 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 560 and 545 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 288 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales was due primarily to strength in demand for our microcontroller products in end markets that we serve and our price increases 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product however the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have increased in recent periods and have remained relatively stable over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices 

analog 

  

our analog product line includes analog interface mixed signal and timing products our analog product line accounted for approximately 284 and 279 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively 

net sales from our analog product line increased approximately 276 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales was primarily due to strength in demand for our analog products in end markets that we serve and our price increases 

  

we consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products 

other 

  

our other product line includes fpga products royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies sales of our intellectual property fees for engineering services memory products timing systems manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits and certain products for aerospace applications revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 156 and 176 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively 

net sales related to these products and services increased approximately 114 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales was primarily due to strength in demand for our products in end markets that we serve and our price increases net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our fpga products licenses engineering services memory products and manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 48 and 50 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively the decrease in the distribution percentage of our total net sales is due to lower preferred supply program participation among our distributors as priority of supply under the preferred supply program is more prevalent with direct customers no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021 our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice with the exception of orders placed under our preferred supply program the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2022 our distributors maintained 17 days of inventory of our products compared to 22 days at march 31 2021 over the past ten fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 17 days and 40 days inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales our distributor inventory days are at historic lows due to the imbalance between the supply of and the demand for our products in the current supplyconstrained environment 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were as follows dollars in millions 



americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 78 and 77 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in europe as a percentage of total net sales increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to strength in demand in our microcontroller and analog product lines our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit in fiscal 2022 was 445 billion or 652 of net sales compared to 338 billion or 621 of net sales in fiscal 2021 the following table summarizes the material and primary drivers of our change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales with the material factors discussed in more detail below the table dollars in millions 



unabsorbed capacity charges  when production levels are below normal capacity which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90 to 95 we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70 to 75 during fiscal 2022 we operated at above normal capacity levels and we expect this to continue if the current supply constraints relative to demand continue during fiscal 2021 we operated at below normal capacity levels primarily due to general economic conditions and uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of 296 million we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions 

net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit  the net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit may fluctuate over time due to sales volumes of lower or higher margin products changes in selling prices and fluctuations in product costs during fiscal 2022 product mix resulted in a decrease of 1525 million in cost of goods sold and an increase in gross profit compared to fiscal 2021 

our overall inventory levels were 8544 million at march 31 2022 compared to 6650 million at march 31 2021 we maintained 125 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2022 compared to 112 days of inventory at march 31 2021 we expect our days of inventory levels at june 30 2022 to be 128 to 134 days 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog fpga products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs 

we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand the philippines and other locations throughout the world during fiscal 2022 approximately 59 of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities compared to approximately 53 during fiscal 2021 during fiscal 2022 approximately 64 of our test requirements were performed in our internal test facilities compared to approximately 57 during fiscal 2021 the increases in the percentage of assembly and test operations that were performed internally in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 are primarily due to our investments in assembly and test equipment which increased our internal capacity capabilities thirdparty contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly and test operations the percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased 

control over these portions of the manufacturing process we plan to continue to transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements approximately 60 of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in fiscal 2022 compared to 61 in fiscal 2021 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

research and development 

rd expenses for fiscal 2022 were 9891 million or 145 of net sales compared to 8364 million or 154 of net sales for fiscal 2021 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

rd expenses increased 1527 million or 183 for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 the primary reason for the increase in rd expenses in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was higher compensation costs in the first half of fiscal 2021 we initially implemented measures to help prepare for economic uncertainty such as employee salary cuts limiting hiring reducing business travel costs and discretionary spending however in december 2020 we restored previous reductions in compensation and resumed hiring 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 were 7189 million or 105 of net sales compared to 6103 million or 112 of net sales for fiscal 2021 our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force cems and eses who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1086 million or 178 for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 the primary reason for the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was higher compensation costs in the first half of fiscal 2021 we initially implemented measures to help prepare for economic uncertainty such as employee salary cuts limiting hiring reducing business travel costs and discretionary spending however in december 2020 we restored previous reductions in compensation and resumed hiring 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2022 was 8625 million compared to 9323 million in fiscal 2021 the primary reason for the decrease in acquired intangible asset amortization was due to the use of accelerated amortization methods 

special charges and other net 

during fiscal 2022 we incurred special charges and other net of 295 million primarily related to restructuring of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency legal contingencies and exiting nonmanufacturing facilities including contract termination costs employee severance and the disposal of assets during fiscal 2021 we incurred special charges and other net of 17 million primarily related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations partially offset by asset sales and other acquisition related activity restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 include 211 million and 150 million respectively related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations 

other income expense 

interest income in fiscal 2022 was 05 million compared to 17 million in fiscal 2021 

interest expense in fiscal 2022 was 2570 million compared to 3569 million in fiscal 2021 the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 relates to the cumulative pay down of our debt and lower interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt 

loss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2022 was 1134 million compared to 2996 million in fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022 the losses primarily related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 senior convertible debt our 2017 senior convertible debt and our 2017 junior convertible debt as well as the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement and the repayment of 100 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 3922 2021 notes in fiscal 2021 the losses primarily related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 senior convertible debt our 2017 senior convertible debt and our 2017 junior convertible debt as well as the payment of all amounts outstanding under our bridge loan facility and our term loan facility the net losses recognized on the settlement of our convertible debt are comprised of two components i the inducement loss which is the excess of the fair value of the consideration provided to the holder over the fair value of the debt and ii the extinguishment loss or gain which is the difference between the fair value of the debt component and the carrying value on the settlement date 

other income net in fiscal 2022 was 28 million compared to other loss net of 38 million in fiscal 2021 the primary reasons for the change in other loss income net during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 relates to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and gains on equity investments 

provision for income taxes 

our provision or benefit for income taxes is attributable to us federal state and foreign income taxes a comparison of our tax rates in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 is not meaningful due to the amount of pretax income and income tax benefit recorded during the prior period 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 includes a 495 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 33 a 176 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 12 a 471 million tax benefit related to changes in various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 32 a 1399 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations which increased our effective tax rate by 94 and a 255 million tax benefit related to the settlement of convertible debt which reduced our effective tax rate by 17 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 includes a 476 million tax benefit received from generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 140 a 123 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 36 a 281 million tax expense related to changes in various tax reserves which increased our effective tax rate by 83 a 1225 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations which increased our effective tax rate by 361 a 481 million tax benefit related to the settlement of convertible debt which reduced our effective tax rate by 142 and a 638 million tax benefit related to intragroup transfers of certain intellectual property rights which reduced our effective tax rate by 188 the tax benefit for the intragroup asset transfers primarily consisted of 1555 million recorded as a deferred tax asset which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the new applicable statutory tax rate as well as the reversal of the preexisting deferred tax asset of 903 million which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the applicable statutory tax rate prior to the transfer over the next 15 years we expect to be able to realize the future tax benefit of the deferred tax assets resulting from the intragroup asset transfers it is not uncommon for taxing authorities of different countries to have conflicting views for instance with respect to among other things the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied 

with respect to the valuation of intellectual property rights the taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing the intellectual property rights transferred which could increase our future effective income tax rate and harm our future results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations the effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely but they are generally lower than our combined us federal and state effective tax rate our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was approximately 22 our nonus blended statutory tax rates in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were lower than this amount the difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors including lower statutory rates tax holidays financing arrangements and other factors our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses 

our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations and assets in thailand and ireland our thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future however we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20 we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate the remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the us are earnings accrued in ireland at a 125 statutory tax rate 

in september 2021 we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the internal revenue service irs for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012 the disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters we firmly believe that the assessments are without merit and plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter in december 2021 we filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice we intend to vigorously defend our position and we are confident in our ability to prevail on the merits we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves we believe that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows and that we have adequate tax reserves for all tax matters however the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain and if the irs were to prevail on all of its assertions the assessed tax penalties and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 3194 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at march 31 2022 an increase of 374 million from the march 31 2021 balance 

  

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 284 billion for fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher net income of 129 billion adjusted for noncash and nonoperating charges of 152 billion and net cash inflows of 342 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities the primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2022 include an increase in trade accounts receivable driven primarily by higher net sales and an increase in inventories related to increased production levels and higher costs of materials and production costs in support of customer demand for our products offset by increases in accounts payable accrued and other liabilities driven by timing of payments to our suppliers higher accrued employee compensation and sales related reserves net cash provided by operating activities was 192 billion for fiscal 2021 primarily due to net income of 3494 million adjusted for noncash and nonoperating charges of 159 billion and net cash outflows of 270 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities the primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2021 include an increase in trade accounts receivable and lower inventories related to improved business conditions in the second half of fiscal 2021 as businesses recovered from the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 4777 million for fiscal 2022 compared to 1733 million for fiscal 2021 fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 investing cash flows primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 3701 million and 926 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment towards the second half of fiscal 2021 we started to invest more significantly to expand manufacturing capacity in response to supply constraints relative to current demand levels and we expect this to continue through calendar 2022 and into calendar 2023 we currently intend to invest between 450 million and 550 million in equipment and facilities during the next twelve months we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring inhouse more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations   

  

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 233 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 186 billion for fiscal 2021 significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include 

• in fiscal 2022 138 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt including the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 senior convertible debt our 2017 senior convertible debt and our 2017 junior convertible debt our revolving credit facility and our 3922 2021 notes partially funded by the issuance of our senior notes and 

• in fiscal 2021 141 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt including our revolving credit facility term loan facility and bridge loan facility and the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 senior convertible debt our 2017 senior convertible debt and our 2017 junior convertible debt partially funded by the issuance of our senior notes and 

• in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of 5038 million and 3883 million respectively and 

• in fiscal 2022 we repurchased shares of our common stock for 4256 million 

in december 2021 we amended and restated our credit agreement in its entirety the amended and restated credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility up to 275 billion that terminates on december 16 2026 the credit agreement also permits us subject to certain conditions to add one or more incremental term loan facilities or increase the revolving loan commitments up to 7500 million as of march 31 2022 the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 784 billion at march 31 2022 we had 140 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility compared to 235 billion at march 31 2021 during fiscal 2021 we used borrowings under our revolving 

credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of our 0972 2024 notes to repay all amounts outstanding under our term loan facility 

capital returns 

in november 2021 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 400 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in fiscal 2022 we repurchased approximately 56 million shares of our common stock for 4256 million under this authorization we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in fiscal 2021 as of march 31 2022 we held approximately 233 million shares as treasury shares our current intent is to regularly repurchase shares of our common stock over time based on our cash generation leverage metrics and market conditions 

in october 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 505 billion cash dividends paid per share were 0910 and 0747 during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively total dividend payments amounted to 5038 million and 3883 million during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively a quarterly dividend of 0276 per share was declared on may 9 2022 and will be paid on june 3 2022 to stockholders of record as of may 20 2022 we expect the aggregate cash dividend for the june 2022 quarter to be approximately 1532 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to increase our quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months our longterm liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital requirements interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness capital expenditures cash dividends share repurchases and income tax payments for additional information regarding our cash requirements see note 11 commitments and contingencies note 10 leases note 6 debt and note 12 income taxes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements the semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or convertible debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt tender offers exchange transactions or open market repurchases such issuances tender offers or exchanges or purchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our ability to negotiate acceptable terms our liquidity position and other factors there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from the covid19 pandemic rising interest rates higher inflation economic uncertainty or other factors and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 025 microns to 10 microns processes during fiscal 2021 we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 013 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes during fiscal 2021 we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs 

during fiscal 2020 we announced our intention to repurpose fab 5 to manufacture discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products in connection with these efforts we reduced the clean room footprint and transferred certain higher volume products from fab 5 to our 8inch wafer fabrication facilities in arizona and oregon these restructuring efforts were substantially completed as of march 31 2021 

we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 will allow us to respond to future demand with incremental capital expenditures 

as a result of our acquisition of microsemi we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture we plan to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational with the exception of the facility in santa clara california which we plan to close by december 2021 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries as a result of our acquisitions in recent years we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2021 approximately 61 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

assembly and test 

  

we perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world during fiscal 2021 we increased capacity at our thailand and philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2021 approximately 53 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our internal facilities and approximately 57 of our test requirements were performed in internal facilities we 

use thirdparty assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements over time we intend to continue to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our internal facilities 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory refer to note 5 for a summary of our longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment and rightofuse assets by geography 

  

we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our cems eses and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team eses also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we launched our preferred supply program which provides our customers with prioritized capacity beginning 6 months after their order of 12 months of continuous noncancellable and nonreschedulable backlog 

for information regarding our revenue results of operations and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years refer to our financial statements included in this form 10k 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we derived 50 of our net sales through distributors and 50 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us with the exception of arrow electronics our largest distributor which accounted for 10 

of our net sales in fiscal 2020 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020 

  

with the exception of orders placed under our preferred supply program we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

• performance 

• analog digital and mixed signal functionality and level of functional integration 

• field programmability 

• memory density 

• low power consumption 

• extended voltage ranges 

• reliability 

• security and functional safety 

• packaging alternatives 

• comprehensive suite of development tools 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

• ease of use 

• functionality of application development systems 

• hardware software and tool compatibility within product families to increase migration flexibility 

• dependable delivery quality and availability 

• technical and innovative service and support 

• time to market 

• price 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates from 2021 through 2039 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain inbound and outbound intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties 

asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided licensees of our technology may become unable to pay or dispute their obligations to pay us royalties or fees litigation arbitration or other proceedings which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses the necessity of engaging in defensive legal proceedings or any negative results of these proceedings could harm our business 

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

human capital resources 

our employees 

we invest in our highlyskilled global workforce of approximately 19500 people in accordance with our guiding value employees are our greatest strength we believe that our culture values and organizational development and training programs provide an inclusive work environment where our employees are empowered and engaged to deliver the best embedded control solutions to our customers

risks related to our business operations and industry 

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

• general economic industry public health or political conditions in the us or internationally including ongoing uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and its implications 

• disruptions in our business our supply chain or our customers businesses due to public health concerns including viral outbreaks such as covid19 cybersecurity incidents terrorist activity armed conflict war worldwide oil prices and supply fires natural disasters or disruptions in the transportation system 

• constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers ability to ship their products which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers 

• our ability to increase our factory capacity to respond to changes in customer demand 

• our ability to secure sufficient wafer foundry assembly and testing capacity 

• availability of raw materials supplies and equipment 

• changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers and market fluctuations in the industries into which such products are sold 

• the level of order cancellations or pushouts due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or other factors 

• trade restrictions and increase in tariffs including those on business in china or focused on specific companies 

• the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory 

• our ability to continue to realize the expected benefits of our past or future acquisitions 

• changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields 

• changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality

• announcements of other significant acquisitions by us or our competitors 

• costs and outcomes of any current or future tax audits or any litigation investigation or claims involving intellectual property our microsemi acquisition customers or other issues 

• fluctuations in commodity or energy prices and 

• property damage or other losses whether or not covered by insurance 

periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock uncertain global economic and public health conditions such as the covid19 pandemic have caused or may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparisons between periods less meaningful 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers any downturn in global economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise may adversely impact their financial viability the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our inability to collect our accounts receivable balances higher allowances for credit losses and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales 

we may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers needs or increase costs due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic increased tariffs or other factors 

our manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources for these supplies but there may be a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting our standards we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or parts in particular we have recently experienced longer lead times for some assembly raw materials required for production purposes an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business the supplies necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them also the impact of the covid19 pandemic or the application of trade restrictions or tariffs by the us or other countries may adversely impact the industry supply chain for example in 2019 the us government increased tariffs on us imports with china as their country of origin likewise the china government increased tariffs on china imports with us as their country of origin we have taken steps to attempt to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not significantly increase the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china will increase our costs and could have an adverse impact on our operating results in future periods we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our operations this could also impair sourcing flexibility 

our customers may also be adversely affected by these same issues the supplies and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers consolidation in their supply chain the impact of the covid19 pandemic or trade restrictions or tariffs that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs if our customers are not able to produce their products then their need for our products will decrease such interruptions of our customers’ businesses could harm our business 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2021 approximately 77 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 22 in china and 16 in taiwan during fiscal 2020 approximately 78 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 21 in china and 15 in taiwan 

a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy although our sales in the chinese market have been strong in recent quarters competition in china is intense also during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 economic weakness in the chinese market adversely impacted our sales volumes in china as discussed in the risk factor above the trade relationship between the us and china remains challenging economic conditions in china remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods weakening of foreign markets could result in lower demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities and finished goods warehouses near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability and severe flooding in the past there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we have a test facility in calamba philippines we use foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

• political social and economic instability due to the covid19 pandemic or other factors 

• trade restrictions and changes in tariffs 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

• economic uncertainty in the worldwide markets served by us 

• import and export license requirements and restrictions 

• changes in laws related to taxes environmental health and safety technical standards and consumer protection 

• currency fluctuations and foreign exchange regulations 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• employment regulations 

• disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents 

• disruptions in international transport or delivery 

• public health conditions including viral outbreaks such as covid19 and 

• difficulties in collecting receivables and longer payment cycles 

if any of these risks occur or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer we could face an increase in the cost of components production delays business interruptions delays in obtaining export licenses tariffs and other restrictions longer payment cycles increased taxes restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

we depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and have limited visibility to product shipments other than orders placed under our preferred supply program 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders that are both received and shipped in the same quarter which we call turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically our ability to respond quickly to customer orders has been part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our visibility on future shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times although our backlog has been very strong in recent periods due to favorable industry conditions and the impact of our preferred supply program turns orders remain important to our ability to meet our business objectives because turns orders can be difficult to predict especially in times of economic volatility where customers may change order levels within the quarter varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

in february 2021 we announced our preferred supply program which offers our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity in the second half of calendar 2021 and the first half of calendar 2022 to participate in the program customers have to place 12 months of orders which cannot be cancelled or rescheduled the capacity priority will begin for shipments in july 2021 the program is not a guarantee of supply however it will provide the highest priority for those orders which are under this program and the capacity priority will be on a firstcome firstserved basis until the available capacity is booked a significant portion of our capacity is booked under this new program we believe this program will enable us to be in a stronger position to make capacity and raw material commitments to our suppliers buy capital equipment with confidence hire employees and ramp up manufacturing and manufacture products more efficiently since this is a new program there can be no assurance that the program will be successful or that it will benefit our business in the event that customers under this program attempt to cancel or reschedule orders we may have to take legal or other action to enforce the terms of the program and any such actions could result in damage to our customer relationships or cause us to incur significant costs 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors as are our superflash and other licensees 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 approximately 61 of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries we also use several contractors located primarily in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products specifically during fiscal 2021 approximately 47 of our assembly requirements and 43 of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 55 of our assembly requirements and 46 of our test requirements during fiscal 2020 due to increased demand for our products we have recently taken actions to increase our capacity allocation from our wafer fabrication assembly and test subcontractors however we expect foundry capacity to continue to be tight due to strong demand for wafers across the industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure further additional capacity or that such capacity will be available on acceptable terms we expect that our reliance on third party contractors may increase over time as our business grows 

our use of third parties reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if a significant contractor were to experience production difficulties insufficient capacity decreased manufacturing assembly and test yields or increased costs due to disruptions from the covid19 pandemic political upheaval 

or infrastructure disruption if third parties do not timely deliver products or services in accordance with our quality standards we may be unable to qualify alternate manufacturing sources in a timely manner on favorable terms or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon processes that we need or fail to adopt technologies that we desire to control costs in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further use of subcontractors increases the risks of misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees rely on wafer foundries if our licensees experienced disruption in supply at such foundries this would reduce the revenue from our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and faces price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue product offerings and scale we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including but not limited to 

• the relative impact of the covid19 pandemic on us relative to our competitors 

• changes in demand in the markets that we serve and the overall rate of growth or contraction of such markets including but not limited to the automotive personal computing and consumer electronics markets 

• our ability to obtain adequate foundry and assembly and test capacity and supplies at acceptable prices 

• the quality performance reliability features ease of use pricing and diversity of our products 

• our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies 

• the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their applications and the success of such applications 

• the rate at which the markets that we serve redesign and change their own products 

• our ability to ramp production and increase capacity at our wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities 

• product introductions by our competitors 

• the number nature and success of our competitors in a given market 

• our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights 

• our ability to address the needs of our customers and 

• general market and economic conditions 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of a product the average selling prices of our microcontroller fpga products and proprietary products in our analog product line have remained relatively constant over time while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary products in our analog product line have declined over time the overall average selling price of our products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period generally the selling prices of our products increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to increased material costs and increased functionality of products 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have moderated average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices however we may not be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary products in our analog product line we may be unable to maintain average selling prices due to increased pricing pressure which could adversely impact our operating results 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

integrated circuits manufacturing processes are complex and sensitive to many factors including contaminants in the manufacturing environment or materials used the performance of our personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue and penalties for failure to meet shipment deadlines our operating results are adversely affected when we operate below optimal capacity in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of 296 million and 472 million respectively 

our operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand historically since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business generates stronger revenues in the first half and comparatively weaker revenues in the second half of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic or trade tensions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition of microsemi have had and can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality in periods when broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonality on our business the semiconductor industry has had significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers 

sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and our largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 we do not have longterm purchase agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

future adverse conditions in the us or global economies including the impact of the covid19 pandemic or credit markets could materially impact distributor operations any deterioration in the financial condition or disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn there may be an oversupply and decrease in demand for our products which could reduce our net sales in a given period and increase inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

• effective new product selection 

• timely completion and introduction of new product designs 

• procurement of licenses for intellectual property rights from third parties under commercially reasonable terms 

• timely filing and protection of intellectual property rights for new product designs 

• availability of development and support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and 

• market acceptance of our customers end products 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and others in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in transitioning to advanced process technologies and have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

business interruptions to our operations or those of our key vendors licensees or customers could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors licensees or customers may be disrupted due to public health concerns including outbreaks such as covid19 work stoppages power loss insufficient water cyber attacks computer network compromises incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive 

contamination or fire earthquake floods droughts volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that we will avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a business interruption for example in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 restrictions on travel adversely impacted our manufacturing operations in the philippines and our subcontractors manufacturing operations in malaysia and china similar challenges arose for our logistics service providers which adversely impacted their ability to ship product to our customers the pandemic could adversely impact our business in future periods if the impact of covid19 increases in the future local governments could require us to temporarily reduce production further or cease operations at any of our facilities and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders 

additionally operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in april and may 2020 we received a greater number of order cancellations and requests by our customers to reschedule deliveries to future dates some customers requested order cancellations within our firm order window and claimed applicability of force majeure clauses likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline 

also thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to timely shift production to other facilities and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment business interruptions would likely cause delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not compensate us for any losses or damages and business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop such technologies and to introduce new technologies to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

• proper identification of licensee requirements 

• timely development and introduction of new or enhanced technology 

• our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights for our licensed technology 

• our ability to limit our liability and indemnification obligations to licensees 

• availability of development and support services to assist licensees in their design and manufacture of products 

• availability of foundry licensees with sufficient capacity to support oem production and 

• market acceptance of our customers end products 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or reduced production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive our technology license agreements generally include a clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from certain intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management these issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

reliance on sales into governmental projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a significant portion of the sales of microsemi which we acquired in may 2018 are from or are derived from government agencies or customers who sell to us government agencies such sales are subject to uncertainties regarding governmental spending levels spending priorities regulatory and policy changes future sales into us government projects are subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities including the budgetary process changes in the timing and spending priorities the impact of any past or future government shutdowns contract terminations or renegotiations future sequestrations or the impact of the covid19 pandemic for example as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced suspensions and stop work orders for some of our subcontracts although such actions have not yet had a material adverse impact on our business there can be no assurance as to the future costs or implications of such actions sales into government projects are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary regulatory tax and trade policies 

implemented by current or future administrations or by the us congress 

in the past microsemi has experienced delays and reductions in appropriations on programs that included its products for example in 2018 there were two federal government shutdowns further delays reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the us federal government could materially and adversely affect our operating results if the us government fails to complete its annual budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations another federal government shutdown may occur during which we may experience further delays reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts which could materially and adversely affect our operating results while we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions further changes in us government procurement regulations and practices particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs or increase compliance obligations such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification may adversely impact the contracting environment and our operating results 

the us government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with us at any time for example in 2014 the us government terminated a 75 million contract with microsemi uncertainty in government spending and termination of contracts for government related projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenue from our microsemi acquisition our contracts with us governmental agencies or prime customers requires us to comply with the contract terms and governmental regulations particularly for our facilities systems and personnel that service such customers complying with these regulations including audit requirements requires that we devote significant resources to such matters in terms of training personnel information technology and facilities any failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and penalties and loss of current or future business that may materially and adversely affect our operating results 

from time to time we receive grants from governments agencies and research organizations if we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits and recognize related charges which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

from time to time we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment at specific locations the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive headcount capital and research and development expenditures and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments noncompliance with the conditions of the grants could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses in may 2018 we acquired microsemi which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever integration of our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies we may not realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems it may be difficult to develop manufacture and market the products of a newly acquired company or grow the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction in particular in connection with our microsemi and atmel acquisitions we became involved with thirdparty claims litigation governmental investigations and disputes related to such businesses and transactions see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding such matters acquisitions may also result in charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional sharebased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results to fund our acquisition of microsemi we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately 810 billion of additional debt we may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our revolving credit facility raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business it may be difficult to find or complete divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies which may include site closures timely or on acceptable terms these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to the desired divestiture or the price or terms of the divestiture may be less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture or other exit 

strategy we may have certain continuing obligations to former employees customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing liabilities related to former employees assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

as a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets 

when we acquire a business a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired as of march 31 2021 we had goodwill of 667 billion and net intangible assets of 479 billion in connection with the completion of our acquisition of microsemi in may 2018 our goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly we review our indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020 no intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2021 compared to 22 million in fiscal 2020 if in future periods we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control and remediate any future control deficiencies our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results our ability to operate our business and our reputation with investors 

as discussed in item 9a “controls and procedures” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to it system access although such material weaknesses were remediated in fiscal 2020 there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in the future if we cannot remediate future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses our ability to accurately record process and report financial information and our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements subject us to litigation and investigations negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets 

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap we are required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors in addition to the identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to it system access which were remediated as of march 31 2020 we have from time to time identified other significant deficiencies if we fail to remediate any future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers require that we implement practices that are more stringent than those required by applicable laws 

with respect to labor requirements the materials contained in our products energy efficiency environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we also require our suppliers to adopt such practices our suppliers may in the future refuse to implement these practices or may charge us more for complying with them if certain of our suppliers refuse to implement the practices we may be forced to source from alternate suppliers the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we do not implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing enforcing and auditing customerrequested practices at our own sites and in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require more personnel 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon our personnel the loss of or inability to attract key personnel or the loss of or inability to attract sufficient numbers of nonkey personnel particularly production specialists in our manufacturing operations could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance coverage related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations because we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to employee health matters certain property matters product defects cybersecurity matters employment risks environmental matters political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 

risks related to cybersecurity privacy intellectual property and litigation 

we continue to be the target of attacks on our it systems and data and interruptions in our it systems unauthorized access to our it systems or improper handling of data could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the uninterrupted operation of complex it systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business operations supply chain sales and operating results such disruption could result in an unauthorized release of our our suppliers’ or our customers’ intellectual property or confidential proprietary or sensitive information or the release of personal data any release of such information or data could harm our business or competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages in addition any release of such information or data or the failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of such information may result in regulatory inquiries or penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations claims for damages litigation and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our it systems and data including network compromises attempts to breach our security measures and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems for example in fiscal 2019 we learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers we engaged experienced legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such matters we took various steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and in may 2019 we began implementing a containment plan we routinely evaluate the effectiveness of the containment mechanisms that were implemented and continue to implement additional measures from time to time we have analyzed and continue to analyze the amount and content of the information that was compromised we do not believe that this it system compromise has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us as a result of the it system compromise our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our internal controls related to it system access were not effective resulting in a material weakness in our internal controls for fiscal 2019 although this material weakness in our internal control was remediated in fiscal 2020 there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in future periods 

due to the types of products we sell and the significant amount of sales we make to government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to us government agencies we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in the future attacks on our it systems and data including attempts to breach our security network compromises and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems were any future attacks to be successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have regularly implemented improvements to our 

protective measures which include but are not limited to implementation of the following firewalls endpoint intrusion detection and response software patches log monitors event correlation tools routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits dual factor identification data partitioning and routine password modifications as a result of the material weakness in our internal controls resulting from the it systems compromise in 2019 we have taken remediation actions and implemented additional controls and we are continuing to take actions to attempt to address evolving threats however recent system improvements have not been fully effective in preventing attacks on our it systems and data including breaches of our security measures and there can be no assurance that any future system improvements will be effective in preventing future cyberattacks or disruptions or limiting the damage from any future cyberattacks or disruptions such system improvements have resulted in increased costs to us and any future improvements attacks or disruptions could result in additional costs related to rebuilding our internal systems defending litigation complaints or other claims providing notices to regulatory agencies or other third parties responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to portions of our and our customers data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such breach or loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

our failure to comply with federal state or international privacy and data protection laws and regulations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and internationally regarding privacy and data protection such as the european union’s eu general data protection regulation gdpr the uk equivalent to the gdpr the california consumer privacy act and the california privacy rights act the scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions some of these laws create a broad definition of personal information establish data privacy rights impose data breach notification requirements and create potentially severe statutory damages frameworks and private rights of action for certain data breaches some of the laws and regulations also place restrictions on our ability to collect store use transmit and process personal information and other data across our business for example the gdpr restricts the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area eea to the us and other countries further such laws and regulations have resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies such as us that have employees customers and operations in the eea 

in order to comply with the gdpr we have relied mainly on the european commission’s standard contractual clauses sccs for transfers of personal information from the eea to the us or other countries however the court of justice of the eu in a july 2020 decision schrems ii invalidated the euus privacy shield framework and also called for stricter conditions in the use of the sccs following the schrems ii decision certain data protection authorities in the eu have issued statements advising companies within their jurisdiction not to transfer personal data to the us under the sccs at present there are few if any viable alternatives to the sccs if we are unable to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure that our transfers of personal information from the eea are lawful we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions and substantial fines and injunctions against processing personal information from the eea the loss of our ability to lawfully transfer personal data out of the eea may cause reluctance or refusal by european customers to communicate with us as they are currently and we may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in the eea at significant expense additionally other countries outside of the eea have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency which could increase the cost and complexity of providing our products in those jurisdictions 

furthermore the gdpr and the uk equivalent of the gdpr expose us to two parallel data protection regimes in europe each of which potentially authorizes fines and enforcement actions for certain violations substantial fines may be imposed for breaches of data protection requirements which can be up to 4 of a company’s worldwide revenue or 20 million euros whichever is greater although the uk data protection regime currently permits data transfers from the uk to the eea and other third countries covered by a european commission adequacy decision through the continued use of sccs and binding corporate rules these laws and regulations are subject to change and any such changes could have adverse implications for our transfer of personal data from the uk to the eea and other third countries 

while we plan to continue to undertake efforts to conform to current regulatory obligations and evolving best practices such efforts may be unsuccessful or result in significant costs we may also experience reluctance or refusal by european or multinational customers to continue to provide us with personal data due to the potential risk exposure of personal data transfers and the current data protection obligations imposed on them by applicable data protection laws or by certain data 

protection authorities these and any other data privacy laws and their interpretations continue to develop and their uncertainty and inconsistency may increase the cost of compliance cause compliance challenges restrict our ability to offer products in certain locations in the same way that we have been potentially adversely affect certain thirdparty service providers or subject us to sanctions by data protection regulators all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings investigations or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings investigations or claims regarding intellectual property rights product failures our microsemi acquisition contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us our direct or indirect customers or our licensees these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless have in the past and could in the future result in substantial costs to us if we are unable to resolve or settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms reengineer products or processes to avoid infringement provide a costeffective remedy or successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take a charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries economic damage or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our or our customer’s specifications changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

• costs related to writing off the value of our inventory of nonconforming products 

• recalling nonconforming products 

• providing support services product replacements or modifications to products and the defense of such claims 

• diversion of resources from other projects 

• lost revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders or unpaid receivables 

• customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements and 

• a requirement to pay damages or penalties 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the revenue and profits we received while we exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by law we have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will fully protect against such claims payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace defense safety security and medical where failure of the application could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

our contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities 

with the exception of orders placed under our preferred supply program we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our nondistributor customers and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the customer’s convenience while we had approximately 114000 customers and our ten largest direct customers accounted for approximately 11 of our total revenue for fiscal 2021 and five of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits for example due to uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic we experienced an increase in order cancellations and requests to reschedule deliveries to future dates in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

certain customer contracts differ from our standard terms of sale for some of the markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our customers may have negotiating leverage over us as a result of their market size for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply products on scheduled delivery dates or extend our obligations for liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or intellectual property infringement if we are 

unable to supply the customer as contractually required the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to delays in their manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for costs and damages associated with customer claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay associated legal fees while we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions manage the risks of such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we are unable to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have and may in the future have to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement or product failure this exposes us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products sold under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive under such contracts or potential consequential damages further where we do not have negotiated customer contracts our customers order terms may govern the transaction and contain terms unfavorable to us these risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that are issued may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful 

risks related to taxation laws and regulations 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products could levy fines restrict or delay our ability to export products or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products 

a significant portion of our sales require export and import activities our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to laws and regulations on international trade including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act ears international traffic in arms regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities including those administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control licenses or license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries our inability to timely obtain a license for any reason including a delay in license processing due to a federal government shutdown like that which occurred in 2018 could cause a delay in scheduled shipments which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue within the quarter of a shutdown and in following quarters depending on the extent that license processing is delayed further determination by a government that we have failed to comply with trade regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines penalties and seizure of products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings a change in laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries customers distributors or others for example in fiscal 2019 the us commerce department banned us companies from selling products or transferring technology to zte a chinese company and certain subsidiaries this ban was lifted in july 2018 in fiscal 2020 the us commerce department banned us companies from selling products or transferring technology to certain chinese companies including huawei and certain subsidiaries in fiscal 2020 the us federal acquisition regulation prohibited us governmental agencies from buying equipment using covered telecommunications equipment as a substantial component or critical technology where the technology came from certain chinese companies on july 14 2020 this was expanded to prohibit us governmental agencies from entering into a contract with any company that uses covered telecommunications equipment whether or not the chinese technology is related to the 

procurement effective june 2020 amendments to the ear regarding prohibitions of sales of items with a “military end use” into china russia and venezuela and elimination of an ear license exception apply to more of our products than the previous regulations any of the foregoing changes could adversely impact our operational costs due to the administrative impacts of complying with these regulations and may limit those with whom we conduct business any one or more of these sanctions future sanctions a change in laws or regulations or a prohibition on shipment of our products or transfer of our technology to significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the us and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods implemented trade restrictions and introduced national security protection policies trade tensions between the us and china which escalated in 2018 have continued and include the us increasing tariffs on chinese origin goods and china increasing tariffs on us origin goods some of our products were adversely affected and are continuing to be affected by the increased tariffs we took steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business by making adjustments in operations and supply although these tariff increases did not result in a material adverse impact on our operating costs in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2020 they did reduce demand for our products during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 increased tariffs on our customers products could adversely impact their sales and increased tariffs on our products in comparison to those of our competitors could each result in lower demand for our products 

further changes in trade or national security protection policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or reduce our ability to sell products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

the outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our us and certain foreign income tax returns for fiscal 2007 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from current or future examinations there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates financial position and results of operations 

exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities changes in tax rules and regulations changes in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates financial condition and results of operations 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in many us and foreign jurisdictions our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors including changes to our operating structure intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies 

our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period our future effective tax rates financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside of the us the adoption of the tcja significantly changed the taxation of usbased multinational corporations by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate adopting elements of a territorial tax system assessing a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings the tcja is unclear in some respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service irs as well as state tax authorities and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the tcja along with the state tax impact of these changes and potential future cash distributions will likely have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate furthermore changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future plans regarding reinvestment of such earnings the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations or financial conditions 

the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued a report in 2015 an interim report in 2018 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries where 

we do business similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing income tax framework and proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue 

our business financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted by policies implemented by the new administration 

as a result of the outcome of the 2020 us elections the new administration could make significant legislative and policy changes in areas including but not limited to tax trade labor and the environment if implemented these changes could increase our effective tax rate and increase our selling andor manufacturing costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions changes in tax policy trade regulations or other matters and any uncertainty surrounding the scope or timing of such changes could negatively impact the stock market and reduce the trading price of our stock 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply or the failure of entities that we have acquired over time to have complied with regulations could result in significant fines liability for cleanup suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses environmental laws continue to expand with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products and shipping materials future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in the amount and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may have insufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may have to write off inventory if we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations we expect these risks to continue these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose risks that could harm our results of operations 

climate change regulations could require us to limit emissions change manufacturing processes substitute materials which may cost more or be less available fund offset projects obtain new permits or undertake other costly activities failure to obtain permits could result in fines suspension or cessation of production restrictions on emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs carbon taxes and emission cap and trade programs the cost of compliance with such regulations could restrict our manufacturing operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as utility shortages and higher costs of utilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions which some experts believe may become vulnerable to fires storms severe floods and droughts while our business recovery plans are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other disruptive events our plans may not protect us from all events 

customer demands and regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation and disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries we filed a form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 29 2020 other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that our supply chain is free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing customers may demand that we change the sourcing of materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant materials significantly increases or availability is limited if we change materials or suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing we have incurred and expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may be unable to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as 

conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the responsible minerals initiative or the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act if we are unable to meet customer requirements customers may disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory if it cannot be sold 

in addition to concerns over “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo our customers may require that other minerals and substances used within our supply chain be evaluated and reported on an increase in reporting obligations will increase associated operating costs this could have negative effects on our overall operating profits 

a requirement to fund our foreign pension plans could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

in connection with our acquisitions of microsemi and atmel we assumed pension plans that cover certain french and german employees most of these plans are unfunded in compliance with statutory requirements and we have no immediate intention of funding these plans the projected benefit obligation totaled 830 million at march 31 2021 benefits are paid when amounts become due we expect to pay approximately 16 million in fiscal 2022 for benefits earned should regulations require funding of these plans in the future it could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

risks related to capitalization and financial markets 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the recent past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

• global economic and financial uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic or other factors 

• quarterly variations in our operating results or the operating results of other technology companies 

• changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance 

• changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance or buysell recommendations 

• general conditions in the semiconductor industry 

• our ability to realize the expected benefits of our completed or future acquisitions and 

• actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors 

in addition the stock market has recently and in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to their operating performance these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debt to decline or fluctuate substantially 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage current or future debt 

as of march 31 2021 the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 921 billion as a result of our acquisition of microsemi we have substantially more debt than we had prior to may 2018 at march 31 2021 we had 235 billion in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility which provides up to 357 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2023 at march 31 2021 we had 56 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes and 126 billion in aggregate principal of convertible debt outstanding in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we repurchased 327 billion and 6150 million respectively in principal amount of our convertible debt and repaid all amounts outstanding under our term loan facility primarily through borrowings under our revolving credit facility issuance of senior notes and issuance of convertible debt 

our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance our current or future debt and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on reasonable terms if at all 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash we may not have sufficient cash to fund payments and adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal interest or to refinance our indebtedness including our outstanding convertible debt and senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic competitive and other factors including those related to the covid19 pandemic our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases or acquisitions if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to undertake alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on onerous or highly dilutive terms our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time our senior secured notes are rated by certain major credit rating agencies these credit ratings impact our cost of borrowing and our ability to access the capital markets and are based on our financial performance and financial metrics including debt levels there is no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of our credit rating by a major credit rating agency could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets to refinance our existing debt or finance future debt 

conversion of our convertible debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of such debt upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the convertible debt we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value in cash if the conversion value of the convertible debt exceeds the principal amount we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the convertible debt as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible debt may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible debt could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the convertible debt into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results 

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when the value of a nonus currency significantly declines relative to the us dollar customers transacting in that currency may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar declines significantly relative to the british pound euro thai baht and taiwan dollar the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the us dollar will have on our business or results of operations

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for an overview of our business refer to “part i item 1 business 

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of covid19 developments followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results we then discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled “liquidity and capital resources” our liquidity and capital resources section generally discusses fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 for our discussion of our fiscal 2020 results compared to fiscal 2019 for both our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources sections refer to “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 filed with the sec on may 22 2020 which is incorporated by reference herein 

covid19 developments 

in the first half of fiscal 2021 the covid19 pandemic resulted in a global disruption in economic activity by adversely affecting production creating supply chain and market disruption and adversely impacting businesses and individuals in the second half of fiscal 2021 business conditions were unexpectedly strong as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the pandemic supply chains however were stressed as they were not expecting the level of economic strength that occurred the impact of the pandemic on individuals and in certain locations in which we operate remains uncertain and will depend on many factors such as the effectiveness of containment efforts including the use and effectiveness of vaccines we regularly monitor new information regarding the severity of covid19 and the ability to contain treat or prevent it 

demand for our products that serve certain markets such as consumer automotive and industrial increased in the second half of fiscal 2021 offsetting the adverse demand fluctuations in the early part of fiscal 2021 caused by the covid19 pandemic additionally the markets that benefited earlier in fiscal 2021 from the stayathome economy such as datacenters and communications reverted to normal demand levels by the second half of fiscal 2021 and remained at such levels at the end of fiscal 2021 while we have a diverse customer base operating in diverse industries the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on demand for our products depends on unpredictable future developments 

at this time our global manufacturing sites and our logistics channels are fully operational and local restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic that impacted us in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 have eased during the second half of fiscal 2021 we experienced strong demand and low levels of inventory on our balance sheet and at our external distribution channel partners and we continued to experience constraints in all our internal and external factories and their related manufacturing supply chains we started ramping up production at our internal factories in september 2020 as well as investing in capital additions to expand our internal capacity we also worked closely with our wafer fabrication assembly and test subcontractors to secure additional capacity while we expect our overall capacity to grow every quarter in calendar 2021 we expect the wafer fabrication assembly and test constraints to persist through the remainder of calendar 2021 and possibly into calendar 2022 as a result lead times continue to increase for many of our products if the impact of covid19 continues or worsens the pandemic could adversely impact our business in future periods in the future local governments could require us or our suppliers to temporarily reduce production or cease operations and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders 

in response to the early indications of the covid19 pandemic we took proactive measures to safeguard the health of our employees contractors customers suppliers visitors to our facilities other business partners and our communities we strategically implemented plans intended to ensure business continuity in the event severe outbreaks or government requirements were to impact our operations we monitor governmental policies and cdc recommendations and take appropriate actions which are designed to prevent and control the spread of covid19 

we continuously assess our efforts to combat the covid19 pandemic which have included the following 

• we require social distancing and have established distancing protocols at our facilities we have suspended attendance at conferences and other gatherings and recently began to allow limited business travel we generally require team members to work from home to the extent possible where work from home is not possible all onsite team members are requested to take their temperatures before arriving to work stay home if they do not feel well stay home if they have been exposed to someone with covid19 or its symptoms maintain a safe distance 

from others wash their hands frequently and wear a mask if they choose we clean high touch surfaces at least daily 

• in partnership with our suppliers we have evaluated our supply chain to identify gaps or weak points in order to ensure continuity in some cases we have qualified alternative suppliers and increased our inventory of raw materials 

• we have added and continue to add assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our network of subcontractors 

• we implemented measures to help prepare for economic uncertainty such as employee salary cuts limiting hiring reducing business travel costs reducing discretionary spending and limiting capital expenditures in december 2020 we restored previous reductions in compensation resumed hiring and increased spending for certain capital expenditures to help meet business demands 

• we are working with government authorities in the areas where we have a significant footprint we continue to update ourselves on government requirements relevant regulations industry standards and best practices to help safeguard our team members across the globe 

we believe these actions are important and will help preserve the health of our team members customers suppliers visitors to our facilities people with whom we conduct business and our communities and allow us to safely continue operations however we cannot predict how these actions or the actions taken by government entities suppliers or customers in response to the covid19 pandemic will impact our business revenues or results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general   

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes convertible debt and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and nondistributor customers direct customers and to a lesser extent from royalties paid by licensees of our intellectual property we apply the following fivestep approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition i identify the contract with the customer ii identify performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied 

sales to our distributors are governed by a distributor agreement a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to distributors do not meet the definition of a contract until the distributor has sent in a purchase order we have acknowledged the order we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created this generally occurs 30 days prior to the estimated ship date as is customary in the semiconductor industry we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors as these are forms of variable consideration we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method usually there is only a single performance obligation in the contract and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation after the transaction price has been allocated we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with distributors is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the distributor 

sales to our direct customers are generally governed by a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to direct customers usually do not meet the definition of a contract until shipment of the product occurs generally the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable usually there is only a 

single performance obligation in the contract and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation after the transaction price has been allocated we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer 

revenue generated from our licensees is governed by licensing agreements our primary performance obligation related to these agreements is to provide the licensee the right to use the intellectual property the final transaction price is determined by multiplying the usage of the license by the royalty which is fixed in the licensing agreement revenue is recognized as usage of the license occurs 

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows under the acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2021 we have never recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values we utilize rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees sharebased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods total sharebased compensation expense recognized during the fiscal 2021 was 1983 million of which 1717 million was reflected in operating expenses and 266 million was reflected in cost of sales total sharebased compensation included in our inventory was 102 million at march 31 2021 

if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 296 million and 472 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

the accounting model related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement generally adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period that results in the position being effectively settled or if the statute of limitation expires due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model 

  

convertible debt 

  

upon issuance we separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt by estimating the fair values of the i liability component without a conversion feature and ii the conversion feature this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 

upon settlement of our convertible debt instruments we allocate the total consideration between the liability and equity components based on the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature the difference between the consideration allocated to the liability component and the net carrying value of the liability component is recognized as an extinguishment loss or gain the remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the equity component and recognized as a reduction of additional paidin capital in our consolidated balance sheets in addition if the terms of the settlement are different from the contractual terms of the original instrument we recognize an inducement loss which is measured as the difference between the fair value of the original terms of the instrument and the fair value of the settlement terms 

determining the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature upon issuance and settlement involves estimating the equivalent borrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible instrument given the values of these transactions fair value estimates are sensitive to changes in the equivalent borrowing rate conclusions the measurement of the equivalent borrowing rate requires that we make estimates of volatility and credit spreads to align observable market inputs with the instrument being valued 

lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the convertible debt in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts product liability customer claims governmental investigations and other matters additionally we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims although the outcomes are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation governmental investigations and disputes as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation governmental investigations or disputes in the future 

we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our matters and where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable which generally is based on a probability weighted model if fair value is not determinable contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit 

the following table summarizes our net sales for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 dollars in millions 



the increase in net sales in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to strength in our microcontroller product line the net sales value of inventory at our distributor customers decreased 104 million during fiscal 2021 compared to a decrease of 682 million during fiscal 2020 excluding the impact of changes in distributor inventory levels on net sales net sales increased by 20 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and was positively impacted by strength in our microcontroller product line due to the size complexity and diversity of our customer base we are not able to quantify any material factor contributing to the change other than net demand fluctuations in the end markets that we serve 

other factors that we believe contributed to changes in our reported net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and which are drivers of longterm trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include 

• semiconductor industry conditions 

• our various new product offerings that have increased our served available market 

• customers’ increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions and 

• increasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products through our total systems solutions 

we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020 the overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual products however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period generally selling prices of our products increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to increased material costs and increased functionality of products 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows dollars in millions 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 545 and 534 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 51 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in net sales was due primarily to strength in demand for our microcontroller products in end markets that we serve 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results the average selling price of our microcontroller products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in the average selling price of our microcontroller products in any given period 

analog 

  

our analog product line includes analog interface mixed signal and timing products our analog product line accounted for approximately 279 and 287 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

net sales from our analog product line increased approximately 06 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in net sales was primarily due to strength in demand for our analog products in end markets that we serve partially offset by adverse general economic conditions and the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

  

we consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog product line as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results 

other 

  

our other product line includes fpga products royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies sales of our intellectual property fees for engineering services memory products timing systems manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits and products for aerospace applications revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 176 and 179 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

net sales related to these products and services increased approximately 13 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our fpga products licenses engineering services memory products and manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 50 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 with the exception of arrow electronics our largest distributor which represented 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020 our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2021 our distributors maintained 22 days of inventory of our products compared to 29 days at march 31 2020 over the past ten fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 22 days and 47 days our distributor inventory days were at historic lows due to the imbalance between the supply of and the demand for our products in the current supplyconstrained environment 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows dollars in millions 



americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 77 and 78 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated in fiscal 2021 the covid19 pandemic and the responses to it significantly affected our net sales by geography sales to customers in europe as a percentage of total sales decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to high covid19 infection rates and extensive governmental restrictions which constrained demand at various times during the fiscal year high infection rates also constrained demand in the americas at various times during fiscal 2021 however less stringent governmental restrictions resulted in only a slight decrease in americas sales as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 sales to customers in asia as a percentage of total sales increased significantly in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as the covid19 pandemic was largely under control in china and taiwan in early fiscal 2021 and china and taiwan represent the highest percentage of our net sales 

in asia our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit in fiscal 2021 was 338 billion or 621 of net sales compared to 324 billion or 615 of net sales in fiscal 2020 the following table summarizes the material and primary drivers of our change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales with the material factors discussed in more detail below the table dollars in millions 



unabsorbed capacity charges  when production levels are below normal capacity which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90 to 95 we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70 to 75 during fiscal 2021 we operated at below normal capacity levels primarily due to adverse general economic conditions and uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of 296 million compared to unabsorbed capacity charges of 472 million in fiscal 2020 we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions by the end of fiscal 2021 our manufacturing facilities were operating at or above normal capacity and we expect this to continue if the current supply constraints relative to demand continue through fiscal 2022 

net impact of product mix and average cost per unit  the net impact of product mix and average cost per unit may fluctuate over time due to sales volumes of lower or higher margin products changes in selling prices and fluctuations in product costs during fiscal 2021 product mix resulted in a decrease of 96 million in cost of goods sold and an increase in gross profit compared to fiscal 2020 

our overall inventory levels were 6650 million at march 31 2021 compared to 6857 million at march 31 2020 we maintained 112 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2021 compared to 122 days of inventory at march 31 2020 we expect our days of inventory levels at june 30 2021 to be flat to down 5 days compared to the march 31 2021 levels 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog fpga products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs 

during fiscal 2020 we announced our intention to repurpose fab 5 to manufacture discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products in connection with these efforts we reduced the clean room footprint and transferred certain higher volume products from fab 5 to our 8inch wafer fabrication facilities in arizona and oregon during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we incurred 80 million and 180 million respectively in costs associated with these actions all of which have been recorded within the special charges and other net line item in our statements of income these restructuring efforts were substantially completed as of march 31 2021 and we anticipate that these actions will result in significant cost savings over the next several years 

we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand the philippines and other locations throughout the world during fiscal 2021 approximately 53 of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities compared to approximately 45 during fiscal 2020 during fiscal 2021 approximately 57 of our test requirements were performed in our internal test facilities compared to approximately 54 during fiscal 2020 the increases in the percentage of assembly and test operations that were performed internally in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 are primarily due to our investments in 

assembly and test equipment which increased our internal capacity capabilities thirdparty contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly and test operations the percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process we plan to continue to transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements approximately 61 of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

research and development 

rd expenses for fiscal 2021 were 8364 million or 154 of net sales compared to 8778 million or 166 of net sales for fiscal 2020 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

rd expenses decreased 414 million or 47 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the primary reason for the decrease in rd expenses in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to management of discretionary spending including reduced headcount costs due to reductions in compensation and travel expenses in response to uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 were 6103 million or 112 of net sales compared to 6766 million or 128 of net sales for fiscal 2020 our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force cems and eses who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 663 million or 98 for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the primary reasons for the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses were due to management of discretionary spending including reduced headcount costs due to reductions in compensation and travel expenses in response to uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic as well as lower professional services and legal costs associated with our acquisitions and security remediation costs related to network compromises 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2021 was 9323 million compared to 9939 million in fiscal 2020 the primary reason for the decrease in acquired intangible asset amortization was lower amortization from our acquisition of microsemi and from our prior acquisitions 

special charges and other net 

during fiscal 2021 we incurred special charges and other net of 17 million primarily related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations partially offset by asset sales and other acquisition related activity during fiscal 2020 we incurred special charges and other net of 467 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges of 310 million and legal contingencies of 157 million restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 include 150 million and 180 million respectively related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations other restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were related to our most recent business acquisitions and resulted from workforce property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations 

other income expense 

interest income in fiscal 2021 was 17 million compared to 28 million in fiscal 2020 

interest expense in fiscal 2021 was 3569 million compared to 4973 million in fiscal 2020 the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 relates to the cumulative pay down of our debt and lower interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt 

during fiscal 2021 we recognized losses of 2996 million related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 senior convertible debt our 2017 senior convertible debt and our 2017 junior convertible debt as well as the payment of all amounts outstanding under our bridge loan facility and our term loan facility during fiscal 2020 we recognized losses of 54 million consisting of 20 million primarily related to the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the outstanding balance on our term loan facility and 34 million related to the settlement of 6150 million in principal of our 2015 senior convertible debt the net losses recognized on the settlement of our convertible debt are comprised of two components i the inducement loss which is the excess of the fair value of the consideration provided to the holder over the fair value of the debt and ii the extinguishment loss or gain which is the difference between the fair value of the debt component and the carrying value on the settlement date 

other loss net in fiscal 2021 was 38 million compared to other income net of 32 million in fiscal 2020 the primary reason for the change in other loss income net during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

provision for income taxes 

our provision or benefit for income taxes is attributable to us federal state and foreign income taxes a comparison of our effective tax rates in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 is not meaningful due to the amount of pretax income and income tax benefits recorded during the period 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 includes a 484 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 143 a 123 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 36 a 44 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 13 a 1018 million tax expense for global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and foreignderived intangible income fdii net of credits which increased our effective tax rate by 300 a 481 million tax benefit related to the settlement of convertible debt which reduced our effective tax rate by 142 and a 638 million tax benefit related to intragroup transfers of certain intellectual property rights which reduced our effective tax rate by 188 the tax benefit for the intragroup asset transfers primarily consisted of 1555 million recorded as a deferred tax asset which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the new applicable statutory tax rate as well as the reversal of the preexisting deferred tax asset of 903 million which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the applicable statutory tax rate prior to the transfer over the next 15 years we expect to be able to realize the future tax benefit of the deferred tax assets resulting from the intragroup asset transfers it is not uncommon for taxing authorities of different countries to have conflicting views for instance with respect to among other things the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied with respect to the valuation of intellectual property rights the taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing the intellectual property rights transferred which could increase our future effective income tax rate and harm our future results of operations 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes a 408 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 272 an 111 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 74 a 285 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of 

limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 190 a 547 million tax expense for gilti and fdii net of credits which increased our effective tax rate by 364 and a 3348 million tax benefit related to intragroup transfers of certain intellectual property rights which reduced our effective tax rate by 2229 the tax benefit for the intragroup asset transfers primarily consisted of 780 million recorded as a deferred tax asset which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the new applicable statutory tax rate as well as the reversal of the preexisting deferred tax liability of 2599 million which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the applicable statutory tax rate prior to the transfer 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations the effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely but they are generally lower than our combined us federal and state effective tax rate our domestic statutory tax rate in each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 was approximately 22 our nonus blended statutory tax rates in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were much lower than this amount the difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors including lower statutory rates tax holidays financing arrangements and other factors our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses 

our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations and assets in thailand malta and ireland our thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future however we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20 we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate the remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the us are earnings accrued in ireland at a 125 statutory tax rate and earnings accrued in malta at a 0 to 5 tax rate 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

in july 2015 in altera corp v commissioner the us tax court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement in the july 2015 ruling the tax court concluded that the sharing of the cost of employee stock compensation in a company’s costsharing arrangement was invalid under the us administrative procedures act in june 2019 a panel of the ninth circuit of the us court of appeals reversed this decision in july 2019 altera petitioned us court of appeals for the ninth circuit to hold an en banc rehearing of the case in november 2019 the en banc rehearing petition was denied and altera asked the us supreme court for a judicial review in june 2020 the us supreme court declined to issue a writ of certiorari in altera v commissioner leaving intact the decision reached by the ninth circuit of the us court of appeals based on the ninth circuit opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of 233 million in fiscal 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 2820 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at march 31 2021 a decrease of 1210 million from the march 31 2020 balance 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 192 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to 154 billion for fiscal 2020 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to efforts focused on working capital and discretionary spending management 

net cash used in investing activities was 1733 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 1332 million for fiscal 2020 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 investing cash flows primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 926 million and 676 million in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively capital expenditures which were comparatively lower in fiscal 2020 and through the first half of fiscal 2021 related primarily to the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment towards the second half of fiscal 2021 we started to invest more significantly to expand manufacturing capacity in response to supply constraints relative to current demand levels and we expect this to continue in fiscal 2022 we currently intend to invest between 225 million and 275 million in equipment and facilities during the next twelve months we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring inhouse more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 186 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 144 billion for fiscal 2020 significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include 

• in fiscal 2021 141 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt including our revolving credit facility term loan facility and bridge loan facility and the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 senior convertible debt our 2017 senior convertible debt and our 2017 junior convertible debt partially funded by the issuance of our senior notes 

• in fiscal 2020 107 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt including our revolving credit facility our term loan facility and the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 senior convertible debt partially funded by term loans made under the bridge loan facility and 

• in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of 3883 million and 3501 million respectively 

in march 2020 and september 2019 we amended our credit agreement dated may 29 2018 to among other things reduce the margin added to the interest rate on revolving loans under the credit agreement and amend certain negative covenants including covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur subsidiary indebtedness grant liens and enter into certain restrictive agreements the amendments also allow us the option to factor receivables and certain related assets the amendments lowered the revolving credit facility thereunder to 357 billion from 360 billion the revolving loan commitments terminate in may 2023 and bear interest at our option at the base rate plus a spread of 000 to 075 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 175 in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period 

as of march 31 2021 the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 921 billion at march 31 2021 we had 235 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility compared to 239 billion at march 31 2020 during fiscal 2021 we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of our 0972 2024 notes to repay all amounts outstanding under our term loan facility see note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our contractual obligations related to our longterm debt 

the enactment of the tcja imposed a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of nonus subsidiaries of us corporations due to this change the jurisdiction in which our cash is at any given point in time no longer has a significant impact on our liquidity future distributions of a significant portion of our nonus assets to the us will no longer be subject to us federal taxation we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts during fiscal 2018 we recognized a onetime transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings of which we expected cash payments of approximately 2903 million this tax is payable over a period of eight years with 8 of the transition tax payable each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023 and 15 20 and 25 

respectively payable during fiscal 2024 fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 as of march 31 2021 our transition tax payable was 2206 million of which 232 million is payable within the next 12 months 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations has had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2021 we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

there were no repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 as of march 31 2021 we held approximately 110 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 45 billion cash dividends paid per share were 1494 and 1465 during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively total dividend payments amounted to 3883 million and 3501 million during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively a quarterly dividend of 0413 per share was declared on may 6 2021 and will be paid on june 4 2021 to stockholders of record as of may 21 2021 we expect the aggregate cash dividend for the june 2021 quarter to be approximately 1130 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or convertible debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt tender offers exchange transactions or open market repurchases such issuances tender offers or exchanges or purchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our ability to negotiate acceptable terms our liquidity position and other factors there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from the covid19 pandemic or other factors and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders

market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of microsemi and other companies that outsource all or substantial portions of their manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  



 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 microns to 10 microns processes during fiscal 2020  we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 013 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes during fiscal 2020  we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs 

fab 5 is a 6inch wafer fabrication facility that currently utilizes processes from 025 microns to 10 microns during fiscal 2020  we announced our intention to repurpose fab 5 to manufacture discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products in connection with these efforts we reduced the clean room footprint and transferred certain higher volume products to our 8inch wafer fabrication facilities in arizona and oregon we anticipate that these actions will result in significant cost savings over the next several years 

  

we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

as a result of our acquisition of microsemi we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture we plan to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational with the exception of the facility in bend oregon which discontinued production in march 2019 and the facility in santa clara california which we plan to close by march 2021 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries as a result of our acquisitions in recent years we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2020  approximately 61 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

assembly and test 

  

we perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world during fiscal 2020  we increased capacity at our thailand and philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading 

existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2020  approximately 45 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our internal facilities and approximately 54 of our test requirements were performed in internal facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements over time we intend to continue to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our internal facilities 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

the following table summarizes our longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment and rightofuse assets by geography at the end of fiscal 2020  fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 in millions 



1 the amounts presented for march 31 2020 include rightofuse assets of 1195 million due to the adoption of accounting standards codification topic 842 leases  under the retrospective cumulative effect adjustment transition method the disclosures are not applicable for the fiscal years ended march 31 2019 and march 31 2018 see note 11  leases  for further information 

we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers embedded solutions engineers eses and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team eses also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

for information regarding our revenue results of operations and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years refer to our financial statements included in this form 10k 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2020  we derived 50 of our net sales through distributors and 50 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2019  we derived 51 of our net sales through distributors and 49 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2018  we derived 54 of our net sales through distributors and 46 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us with the exception of arrow electronics our largest distributor which made up 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2018  no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales 

  

we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

backlog 

  

as of march 31 2020  our backlog was approximately 242 billion  compared to 220 billion as of march 31 2019  our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of our sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates through 2039 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided litigation which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the necessity of engaging in defensive litigation could harm our business 

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2020  we had approximately 18000 employees we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

  

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission   

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock uncertain global economic and public health conditions such as the covid19 virus have caused or may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions as a result of the covid19 virus or otherwise may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the recent past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has recently and from time to time in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures including our acquisition of microsemi 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses in may 2018 we completed our acquisition of microsemi which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever and in april 2016 we completed our acquisition of atmel the integration process for our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction in particular in connection with our microsemi and atmel acquisitions we became involved with thirdparty claims litigation governmental investigations and disputes related to such businesses and transactions see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding such matters acquisitions may also result in charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional sharebased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results to fund our acquisition of microsemi we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately 810 billion of additional debt we may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our revolving credit facility raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies which may include site closures on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to assets or a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture or other exit strategy we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to former employees customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing obligations for preexisting liabilities related to the former employees assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

as of march 31 2020  the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 1059 billion  in connection with our acquisition of microsemi we incurred debt consisting of 310 billion under our revolving line of credit 300 billion under our term loan facility and 200 billion in senior secured notes at march 31 2020  we had 239 billion in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit which provides up to 357 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2023 at march 31 2020  we had 172 billion of outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility in march 2020 we financed the settlement of 6150 million in principal amount of our 2015 senior convertible debt through borrowings under our bridge loan facility at march 31 2020  we had 387 billion of outstanding principal related to our convertible debt consisting of 277 billion of aggregate principal value issued in 2017 and 111 billion of principal value issued in 2015 

as a result of such transactions we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance our convertible debt senior debt term loan debt or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

servicing our current debt requires a significant amount of cash we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to fund future payments and any adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our outstanding convertible debt and senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors including uncertainties related to the covid19 virus our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases or acquisitions if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time our senior secured notes are rated by certain major credit rating agencies these credit ratings impact our cost of borrowing and our ability to access the capital markets and are based on our financial performance and certain financial metrics including debt levels there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets to refinance our existing debt or finance future debt 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility to future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict especially in times of economic volatility such as those caused by the covid19 virus where customers may increase or decrease order levels within the quarter varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

we may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers needs or increase costs due to the impact of the covid19 virus increased tariffs or other factors 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the relationships that we have with our suppliers also the impact of the covid19 virus or the application of trade restrictions or tariffs by the us or other countries may adversely impact the industry supply chain for example in 2019 the us government increased tariffs on products that have china as their country of origin and which are imported into the us likewise the china government increased tariffs on products that have the us as their country of origin and which are imported into china we have taken steps to attempt to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china will increase our costs and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the three months ending june 30 2020 or future periods we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our operations this could also impair sourcing flexibility we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts in particular we have recently experienced longer lead times for equipment which we need for capacity expansion at certain of our manufacturing facilities an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

our customers may also be adversely affected by these same issues the materials components and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers consolidation in their supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions the impact of the covid19 virus or application of trade restrictions or tariffs that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs if our customers are not able to produce their products then their need for our products will decrease such interruptions of our customers’ businesses could harm our business 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do the semiconductor industry has experienced significant merger and acquisition activity and consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue product offerings and scale we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 



 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the average selling prices of our microcontroller fpga and proprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have declined over time the overall average selling price of our products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 approximately 61 and 57 respectively of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries we also use several contractors located primarily in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products specifically during fiscal 2020 approximately 55 of our assembly requirements and 46 of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 62 of our assembly requirements and 51 of our test requirements during fiscal 2019 our reliance on third party contractors and foundries has increased as a result of our acquisitions including our acquisitions of microsemi and atmel the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels due to disruptions from the covid19 virus or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner on terms favorable to us or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that we desire to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further our use of subcontractors increases the risks of potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for our failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of 472 million and 162 million  respectively 

our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand historically since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business tends to generate stronger revenues in the first and second quarters and comparatively weaker revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 virus or trade tensions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition of microsemi have had and can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality as a result in periods when these broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers 

sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and approximately 51 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies including the impact of the covid19 virus or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in demand for our products from our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

we continue to be the target of attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems and any interruptions in our it systems unauthorized access to our it systems or improper handling of data could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex it systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our business operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our business or competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by any such disruptions or security breaches additionally any failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations litigation fines and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data network compromises attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems for example in fiscal 2019 we learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers we engaged experienced legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such matters we took various steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and in may 2019 we began implementing a containment plan we routinely evaluate the effectiveness of the containment mechanisms that were implemented and continue to implement additional measures from time to time we have analyzed and continue to analyze the amount and content of the information that was compromised we do not believe that this it system compromise has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us as a result of the it system compromise our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our internal controls related to it system access were not effective resulting in a material weakness in our internal controls for fiscal 2019 although this material weakness in our internal controls was remediated in fiscal 2020 there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in future periods 

due to the types of products we sell and the significant amount of sales we make to government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to us government agencies we expect to continue to be the target of attacks on our data attempts to breach our security network compromises and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems were any future attacks to be successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have regularly implemented improvements to our protective measures which include but are not limited to the following firewalls endpoint detection and response software patches log monitors event correlation tools routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits dual factor identification data partitioning and routine password modifications as a result of the material weakness in our internal controls resulting from the it systems compromise in 2019 we have taken remediation actions and implemented additional controls and we plan to continue to take further actions to attempt to address evolving threats however recent system improvements have not been fully effective in preventing attacks on our data and breaches to our security and there can be no assurance that any future system improvements will be effective in preventing attacks or breaches or limiting the damage from any future cyber attacks or disruptions such system improvements have resulted in increased costs to us and any future improvements attacks or disruptions could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of our internal systems defending litigation providing notices to regulatory agencies or other third parties responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control and remediate future control deficiencies our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results our ability to operate our business and investors views of us 

as discussed in item 9a “controls and procedures” in our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2019 we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to it system access although such material weaknesses were remediated in fiscal 2020 internal controls are important to accurately reflect our financial position and results of operations in our financial 

reports and there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identified in future periods if we are unable to remediate any future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in an appropriate and timely manner or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses our ability to accurately record process and report financial information and consequently our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements subject us to litigation and investigations negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets 

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we are required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors in addition to the identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to it system access which were remediated as of march 31 2020 we have from time to time identified significant deficiencies related to other matters if we fail to remediate any future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to public health concerns such as the covid19 virus natural disasters cybersecurity incidents or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include public health concerns including viral outbreaks such as the covid19 virus work stoppages power loss insufficient water cyber attacks computer network compromises incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods droughts volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption for example recent restrictions on travel have adversely impacted our manufacturing operations in the philippines and our subcontractors manufacturing operations in malaysia and china similar challenges have arose for our logistics service providers which adversely impacted their ability to ship product to our customers 

in particular recent restrictions on travel have impacted our manufacturing operations in the philippines and our subcontractors manufacturing operations in malaysia and china similar challenges have arisen for our logistics service providers which has impacted their ability to ship product to our customers the impact of such interruptions on our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in the fiscal quarter ended march 31 2020 but we have seen increased impacts since then which we expect to adversely impact our business in the fiscal quarter ended june 30 2020 and which could continue to adversely impact our business in future periods in the future local governments could require us to temporarily reduce production further or cease operations at any of our facilities and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders 

additionally operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons we have received a greater number of order cancellations and requests by our customers to reschedule deliveries to future dates some customers are requesting order cancellations within our firm order window and are claiming applicability of force majeure clauses 

likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline such customer and licensee disruptions are expected to adversely impact our business in the fiscal quarter ended june 30 2020 and we cannot accurately predict whether such disruptions will continue in subsequent periods 

  

also thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technologies and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings investigations or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings investigations or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights product failures our microsemi acquisition contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us our direct or indirect customers or our licensees these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless have in the past and could in the future result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement provide a costeffective remedy or successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries economic damage or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace defense safety security and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products could levy fines restrict or delay our ability to export or transfer products or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products 

a significant portion of our sales are made through the exporting and importing of products in addition to local jurisdictions trade regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations international traffic in arms regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties for example in fiscal 2019 the us commerce department banned us companies from selling products or transferring technology to zte a chinese company and certain of its subsidiaries this ban was lifted in july 2018 in fiscal 2020 the us commerce department banned us companies from selling products or transferring technology to certain chinese companies including huawei and certain of its subsidiaries recent amendments made to the export administration 

regulation ear pursuant to prohibitions of items with a “military end use” in china russia and venezuela 85 fed reg 23459 and elimination of ear license exception civ 85 fed reg 23470 which are effective june 2020 apply to a greater number of our products than previous versions of the regulations these changes could adversely impact our operational costs due to the administrative impacts of complying with these regulations and may limit those with whom we conduct business any one or more of these sanctions future sanctions a change in laws or regulations or a prohibition on shipment of our products or transfer of our technology to significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for certain of our products associated with our microsemi acquisition we rely on us export licenses to ship our products to nonus customers in 2018 there was a federal government shutdown from january 20 2018 to january 23 2018 and a second shutdown from december 22 2018 through january 25 2019 due to the us federal government shutdown the agency that approves these export licenses was temporarily closed this resulted in a delay in certain shipments that were scheduled to ship within the quarter although this delay did not result in a material adverse impact on our revenue in previous quarters it could have a material adverse impact on our revenue within the quarter of any future government shutdown and in the following quarter depending on the ability of the governmental agency to expedite processing of licenses delayed during the shutdown additionally certain of our products associated with our microsemi acquisition ship from jurisdictions that microchip did not previously ship from this makes us subject to different jurisdictional export regulations for different products although a delay in approval of exports from any single jurisdiction is unlikely to result in a material adverse impact on our revenue in the short term a denial in approval of exports could over the longer term have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the us and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods and implemented trade restrictions on materials and products trade tensions between the us and china escalated in 2018 and 2019 including the us increasing tariffs on chinese origin goods and china increasing tariffs on us goods some of our products were adversely affected and are continuing to be affected by the increased tariffs higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs were announced as recently as september 2019 we have taken steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  the additional tariffs imposed in 2019 on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china increased our costs but did not have a material adverse impact on our operating results in fiscal 2020 as we were able to make adjustments in operations and supply to mitigate the effects of these tariffs increased tariffs on our customers products could impact their sales of their products and increased tariffs on our products in comparison to those of our competitors could each result in lower demand for our products 

further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including risks from increases in tariffs 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2020 approximately 78 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 21 in china and 15 in taiwan during fiscal 2019 approximately 80 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 22 in china and 13 in taiwan 

  

a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition and economic weakness in the china market has recently made it more difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china in particular the trade relationship between the us and china has worsened economic conditions in china remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods in 2019 the us government increased tariffs on products that have china as their country of origin and which are imported into the us likewise the china government increased tariffs on products that have the us as their country of origin and which are imported into china we have taken steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  the additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china did increase our costs but did not have a material adverse impact on our operating results in fiscal 2020 as we were able to make adjustments in operations and supply to mitigate the effects of these tariffs additionally tariffs on our customers products could impact their sales of such end products 

resulting in lower demand for our products we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our customers 

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past a large portion of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations as part of our atmel acquisition we acquired a test facility in calamba philippines we use various foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer we could face an increase in the cost of components production delays general business interruptions delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs and other barriers and restrictions longer payment cycles increased taxes restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business 

further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

our contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our nondistributor customers and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had approximately 120000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 12 of our total revenue for fiscal 2020 and six of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

we have contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on 

our liability exposure sometimes we are not able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have been and may in the future be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement product failure or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages further where we do not have negotiated contracts with our customers the terms of our customers orders may govern the transaction and contain terms that are not favorable to us these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

reliance on government contracts and sales to governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a significant portion of the sales of microsemi which we acquired in may 2018 are from or are derived from government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to us government agencies such sales are subject to uncertainties regarding governmental spending levels spending priorities regulatory and policy changes future sales to us government agencies or their prime customers are also subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities including the constraints of the budgetary process changes in the timing and potential spending priorities and the impact of any past or future government shutdowns contract terminations or renegotiations future sequestrations or the impact of the covid19 virus for example as a result of the covid19 virus we currently have suspensions and stop work orders in place for some of our subcontracts and we do not know when work on those projects will restart or what additional measures such as purchasing additional protective gear we will need to take to be able to again perform work at those sites although such actions have not yet had a material adverse impact on our business there can be no assurance as to the future costs or implications of such actions sales to government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to us government agencies are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary regulatory tax and trade policies implemented by current or future administrations or by the us congress 

in the past microsemi has experienced delays and reductions in appropriations on programs that included its products for example there were federal government shutdowns from january 20 2018 to january 23 2018 and from december 22 2018 through january 25 2019 further delays reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the us federal government could materially and adversely affect our operating results if the us government fails to complete its annual budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations another federal government shutdown may occur during which time we may experience further delays and reductions in appropriations or reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts which could materially and adversely affect our operating results while we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions further changes in us government procurement regulations and practices particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs or increase compliance obligations such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification may adversely impact the contracting environment and our operating results 

the us government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with microsemi or us at any time for example in 2014 microsemi had a 75 million contract terminated for convenience by the us government uncertainty with respect to government spending and termination of contracts associated with government related projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenue and other benefits we achieve from our microsemi acquisition our business related to us governmental agencies or customers not only requires us to comply with the contract terms but also with applicable governmental regulations particularly for our facilities systems and personnel that service such customers maintaining compliance with these regulations including any audit requirements requires that we devote significant resources to such matters in terms of training personnel information technology and facilities any failure to maintain compliance with these requirements may result in fines and penalties and loss of current or future business that may materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results 

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro thai baht and taiwan dollar the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the us dollar will have on our business or results of operations 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to employee health matters certain property product defects cybersecurity matters employment risks environmental matters political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with all applicable federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply or the failure of entities that we have acquired over time to have complied with applicable regulations could result in significant fines liability for clean up suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in the quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products energy efficiency measures and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than existing legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we pass these requirements regarding operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may in the future refuse to implement these operating practices or may charge us more for complying with them if certain of our suppliers refuse to implement the required practices we may be forced to identify and source from alternate suppliers the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier 

resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

customer demands and regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 31 2019 other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that our supply chain is free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited if we make changes to materials or suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing we have incurred and expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the responsible minerals initiative or the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

in addition to concerns over “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo our customers may also begin to require that additional minerals and substances used within our supply chain be evaluated and reported on as our reporting obligations increase so will the operating costs associated with this obligation this in turn could have negative effects on our overall operating profits 

the outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2007 and later we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2007 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates financial position and results of operations 

exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities changes in tax rules and regulations including the act changes in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates financial condition and results of operations 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors including but not limited to changes to our corporate operating structure intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies 

our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period our future effective tax rates financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside of the us the adoption of the act significantly changed the taxation of usbased multinational corporations by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate adopting elements of a territorial tax system assessing a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings the act is unclear in some respects and will require interpretations and continued implementation of regulations by the internal revenue service as well as state tax authorities and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation a significant portion of our earnings are earned by our subsidiaries outside the us changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the act along with the state tax impact of these changes and potential future cash distributions will likely have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate furthermore changes to the 

taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations or financial conditions 

the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued a report in 2015 an interim report in 2018 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax as well as proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue 

in april 2020 we became aware of a withholding tax regulation that could be interpreted to apply to certain of our previous intragroup transactions we are evaluating whether the interpretation of this regulation could apply to our facts and circumstances and upon conclusion of our analysis we may establish a reserve related to this matter in a subsequent period an estimate of the impact on the financial statements cannot be made at this time 

antitakeover defenses in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage takeover attempts which could also reduce the market price of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of microchip these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 

in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time the application of section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 

any of these provisions could under certain circumstances depress the market price of our common stock 

as a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets 

when we acquire a business a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired as of march 31 2020  we had goodwill of 666 billion and net intangible assets of 570 billion  in connection with the completion of our acquisition of microsemi in may 2018 our balance of goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly we review our indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash 

flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019  in fiscal 2020  we recognized 22 million of intangible asset impairment charges and in fiscal 2019  we recognized 31 million of intangible asset impairment charges if in future periods we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements  

our foreign pension plans are unfunded and any requirement to fund these plans in the future could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

in connection with our acquisitions of microsemi and atmel we assumed defined benefit pension plans that cover certain of our french and german employees plan benefits are managed in accordance with local statutory requirements benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels the projected benefit obligation totaled 700 million at march 31 2020  most of these plans are unfunded in compliance with local statutory regulations and we have no immediate intention of funding these plans benefits are paid when amounts become due commencing when participants retire we expect to pay approximately 13 million in fiscal 2021 for benefits earned should legislative regulations require complete or partial funding of these plans in the future it could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

from time to time we receive grants from governments agencies and research organizations if we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits previously paid to us and recognize related charges which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

from time to time we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment at specific locations the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive headcount capital and research and development expenditures and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments noncompliance by us with the conditions of the grants could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business 

climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs 

and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages and higher costs of water or energy to control the temperature of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as arizona thailand and the philippines some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt our business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

introduction 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 – business item 6 – selected financial data and item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results we then discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the changes in our fiscal 2019 results of operations compared to fiscal 2018 were primarily due to our acquisition of microsemi corporation which closed on may 29 2018 after discussing our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 we provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements our liquidity and capital resources section generally discusses fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 for our discussion of our fiscal 2019 results in comparison to fiscal 2018 for both our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources sections refer to “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 filed with the sec on may 30 2019 which is incorporated by reference herein 

covid19 developments 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in a global reduction in economic activity by adversely affecting production creating supply chain and market disruption and adversely impacting businesses and individuals the severity and duration of the economic impact is currently unknown and will depend on many factors such as the effectiveness of containment efforts we regularly monitor new information regarding the severity of the covid19 virus and the ability to contain treat or prevent it 

demand for our products has increased in the areas of our business that support the stayathome economy such as products used in medical devices datacenter communications infrastructure computers printers monitors and contact free consumer and industrial products however demand has decreased in other areas such as automotive broad based industrial consumer and home appliances and aerospace we have seen a greater number of order cancellations and requests to reschedule deliveries to future dates some customers are requesting order cancellation within our firm order window and are claiming applicability of force majeure clauses while we have a diverse customer base operating in diverse industries the extent of the impact of the covid19 virus on demand for our products depends on unpredictable future developments 

at this time our global manufacturing sites are operational though certain of them are operating at reduced utilization levels this may be due to local restrictions related to the covid19 virus such as our philippine manufacturing sites or a decrease in demand for products manufactured at a particular site additionally travel restrictions have impacted our subcontractors manufacturing operations in malaysia and china and similar challenges have arisen for our logistics service providers which has impacted their ability to ship product to our customers the impact to our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in the fiscal quarter ended march 31 2020 but we have seen increased impacts since then which we expect to adversely impact our business in the fiscal quarter ended june 30 2020 and which could continue to adversely impact our business in future periods in the future local governments could require us to temporarily reduce production further or cease operations at any of our facilities and we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders 

in response to the early indications of the covid19 pandemic we took proactive measures to safeguard the health of our employees contractors customers suppliers visitors to our facilities other business partners and our communities we strategically implemented plans intended to ensure business continuity in the event severe outbreaks or government requirements were to impact our operations we are committed to the health and safety of our employees contractors customers suppliers visitors to our facilities other business partners and communities we are following governmental policies and cdc recommendations designed to slow the spread of the covid19 virus 

our efforts to combat the covid19 virus include the following 



well stay home if they have been exposed to someone with the covid19 virus or its symptoms maintain a safe distance from others wash their hands frequently and wear a mask if they choose we clean high touch surfaces daily 

 

 

 

 

we believe these actions are important and will help preserve the health of our team members customers suppliers visitors to our facilities people with whom we conduct business and our communities and allow us to safely continue operations however we cannot predict how these actions or the actions taken by government entities suppliers or customers in response to the covid19 virus outbreak will impact our business revenues or results of operations 

acquisition of microsemi 

on may 29 2018 we completed our acquisition of microsemi corporation a publicly traded company headquartered in aliso viejo california we paid an aggregate of approximately 819 billion in cash to the stockholders of microsemi the total consideration transferred in the acquisition including approximately 539 million of noncash consideration for the exchange of certain sharebased payment awards of microsemi for stock awards of microchip was approximately 824 billion  in addition to the consideration transferred we recognized in our consolidated financial statements 323 billion in liabilities of microsemi consisting of debt taxes payable and deferred pension obligations restructuring and contingent and other liabilities of which 206 billion of existing debt was paid off we financed the purchase price using approximately 810 billion of borrowings consisting of 310 billion of loans under our revolving line of credit the revolving credit facility 300 billion of term loans term loan facility provided under our amended and restated credit agreement and 200 billion in newly issued senior secured notes we incurred 220 million in costs related to the acquisition as a result of the acquisition microsemi became a wholly owned subsidiary of microchip microsemi offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and system solutions for aerospace and defense communications data center and industrial markets our primary reason for this acquisition was to expand our range of solutions products and capabilities by extending our served available market

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including general purpose and specialized 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers microprocessors fieldprogrammable gate array fpga products a broad spectrum of highperformance linear mixedsignal power management thermal management discrete diodes and mosfets radio frequency rf timing timing systems safety security wired connectivity and wireless connectivity devices as well as serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory eeprom serial flash memories parallel flash memories serial electrically erasable random access memory eeram and serial static random access memory sram we also license flaship solutions that are incorporated in a broad range of products we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power usage wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development thus enabling timely and costeffective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products we license our superflash technology and other technologies to wafer foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products gate array rf and analog products that require embedded nonvolatile memory 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial aerospace office communication and computing our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties our acquisition of microsemi significantly increased the amount of our outsourced manufacturing requirements 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory analog and mixedsignal products fpgas timing systems flaship development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers cems embedded solutions engineers eses and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for cems and distributor sales teams eses also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world or through online webcasts and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

see our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry on page 17 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general   

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying 

value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  

revenue recognition 

on april 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 and all related amendments we generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and nondistributor customers direct customers and to a lesser extent from royalties paid by licensees of our intellectual property we apply the following fivestep approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition 1 identify the contract with the customer 2 identify performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied 

sales to our distributors are governed by a distributor agreement a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to distributors do not meet the definition of a contract as defined by asc 606 until the distributor has sent in a purchase order we have acknowledged the order we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created this generally occurs 30 days prior to the estimated ship date as is customary in the semiconductor industry we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors as these are forms of variable consideration we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method usually there is only a single performance obligation in the contract and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation after the transaction price has been allocated we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with distributors is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the distributor 

sales to our direct customers are generally governed by a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to direct customers usually do not meet the definition of a contract as defined by asc 606 until shipment of the product occurs generally the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable usually there is only a single performance obligation in the contract and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation after the transaction price has been allocated we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer 

revenue generated from our licensees is governed by licensing agreements our primary performance obligation related to these agreements is to provide the licensee the right to use the intellectual property the final transaction price is determined by multiplying the usage of the license by the royalty which is fixed in the licensing agreement revenue is recognized as usage of the license occurs 

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows under the acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2020  we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values we utilize rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees sharebased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods total sharebased compensation expense recognized during the fiscal 2020 was 1702 million  of which 1493 million was reflected in operating expenses and 209 million was reflected in cost of sales total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 144 million at march 31 2020  

if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 472 million and 162 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

the accounting model as defined in accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes asc 740 related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration 

of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement generally adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period that results in the position being effectively settled or if the statute of limitation expires due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model 

  

senior and junior subordinated convertible debt 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts product liability customer claims governmental investigations and other matters additionally we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims although the outcomes are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation governmental investigations and disputes as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation governmental investigations or disputes in the future 

we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our matters and where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable which generally is based on a probability weighted model if fair value is not determinable contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

the following table summarizes our net sales for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 dollars in millions 



the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve which were negatively impacted by general economic conditions trade restrictions adverse changes in tariffs and the impact of the covid19 virus these adverse conditions did not affect each of the markets we serve equally for instance in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019  we experienced relatively weaker demand for our products that are used in the consumer automotive and industrial markets and relatively stronger demand for our products that are used in the computing communication and aerospace and defense markets these adverse conditions negatively affected consolidated net sales by approximately 5 in fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 and such impact was partially offset by the timing of our acquisition of microsemi as fiscal 2020 included twelve months of microsemi net sales compared to ten months of microsemi net sales in fiscal 2019  the timing of our acquisition of microsemi accounted for an increase of approximately 4 in our net sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019  

we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change the overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual products however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period the overall average selling price of our products did not change significantly during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019  

key factors impacting the amount of net sales during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include 

 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows dollars in millions 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 534 and 546 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products decreased approximately 36 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the decrease in net sales was due primarily to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve partially offset by our acquisition of microsemi 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results the average selling price of our microcontroller products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in the average selling price of our microcontroller products in any given period 

analog interface mixed signal and timing products 

  

sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 287 and 286 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

net sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products decreased approximately 13 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the decrease in net sales was due primarily to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve partially offset by our acquisition of microsemi 

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider a majority of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products will increase over time 

fieldprogrammable gate array fpga products 

  

our fpga product line was primarily acquired as part of our acquisition of microsemi on may 29 2018 sales of our fpga products accounted for approximately 71 and 57 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

net sales of our fpga products increased approximately 229 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the increase in net sales was due primarily to our acquisition of microsemi 

fpga product pricing has historically been relatively stable because they are proprietary products with significant design in complexity and are frequently designed into longlived end applications 

licensing memory and other 

  

licensing memory and other lmo includes royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies sales of our intellectual property fees for engineering services memory products timing systems manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits and products for aerospace applications revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 108 and 111 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively 

net sales related to these services and products decreased approximately 36 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 lmo net sales can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our licenses engineering services memory products and manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 50 and 51 our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively with the exception of arrow electronics our largest distributor which made up 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2020 our distributors maintained 29 days of inventory of our products compared to 35 days at march 31 2019 over the past ten fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were as follows dollars in millions 



americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 78 and 80 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia as a percentage of total sales have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market sales to customers in the americas increased as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to our acquisition of microsemi which had more concentration in the aerospace and defense industry in the americas our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 324 billion and 293 billion in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively gross profit as a percentage of sales was 615 and 548 in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively   

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 

  

 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include 

  

 

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity during fiscal 2020  we operated at below normal capacity levels due to lower demand for our products primarily related to general economic conditions and uncertainty from the covid19 virus resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of 472 million compared to unabsorbed capacity charges of 162 million in fiscal 2019 

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins our wafer fabrication facility located in tempe arizona fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 micron to 10 micron processes our wafer fabrication facility located in gresham oregon fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 013 micron to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production in fab 2 and fab 4 has been on 8inch wafers during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90 to 95 our wafer fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado fab 5 currently utilizes processes between 025 micron and 10 micron that run on 6inch wafers we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70 to 75 

our overall inventory levels were 6857 million at march 31 2020 compared to 7117 million at march 31 2019 we maintained 122 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2020 compared to 128 days of inventory at march 31 2019 we expect our days of inventory levels in the june 2020 quarter to be down 6 days to up 8 days compared to the march 2020 levels we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface mixed signal and timing products fpga products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

during fiscal 2020 we announced our intention to repurpose fab 5 to manufacture discrete and specialty products in addition to a lower volume of a diversified set of standard products in connection with these efforts we reduced the clean room footprint and transferred certain higher volume products from fab 5 to our 8inch wafer fabrication facilities in arizona and oregon we anticipate that these actions will result in significant cost savings over the next several years in fiscal 2020  we incurred 180 million in costs associated with these actions which have been recorded within the special charges and other net line item in our statements of income we expect to incur less than 100 million within the next year for the remaining associated costs of these restructuring activities 

  

we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand the philippines and other locations throughout the world during fiscal 2020  approximately 45  of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities compared to approximately 38 during fiscal 2019 during fiscal 2020  approximately 54  of our test requirements were performed in our internal test facilities compared to approximately 49 during fiscal 2019 the increases in the percentage of assembly and test operations that were performed internally in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 are primarily due to our investments in assembly and test equipment which increased our internal capacity capabilities and also due to adverse demand fluctuations in the markets we serve which reduced our demand for external assembly and test operations thirdparty contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly and test operations the percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our 

internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process we plan to continue to transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements during fiscal 2020  approximately 61  of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 57 during fiscal 2019 the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of microsemi for which the majority of its wafer fabrication requirements are outsourced the timing of the acquisition which occurred on may 29 2018 also contributed to the increase as fiscal 2020 included twelve months of microsemi activity compared to ten months in fiscal 2019 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2020 were 8778 million or 166 of net sales compared to 8263 million or 154 of net sales for fiscal 2019 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 515 million or 62 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the primary reason for the increase in rd expenses in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was additional costs from our acquisition of microsemi 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 were 6766 million or 128 of net sales compared to 6829 million or 128 of net sales for fiscal 2019   our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force cems and eses who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 63 million or 09 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the primary reasons for the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses were reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our microsemi acquisition partially offset by remediation costs related to the network compromise discussed in item 9a of this form 10k 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2020 was 9939 million compared to 6741 million in fiscal 2019 the primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization was our acquisition of microsemi 

special charges and other net 

  

during fiscal 2020 we incurred special charges and other net of 467 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges of 310 million and legal contingencies of 157 million during fiscal 2019 we incurred special charges and other net of 337 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges of 639 million offset by the release of 302 million in legal contingencies restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2020 include 180 million related to the restructuring of our 

wafer fabrication operations other restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were related to our most recent business acquisitions and resulted from workforce property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations   

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2020 was 28 million compared to 81 million in fiscal 2019 the primary reason for the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was lower invested cash balances as we used a significant portion of our cash to help finance the purchase price of our acquisition of microsemi and we have continued to pay down our debt 

interest expense in fiscal 2020 was 4973 million compared to 5029 million in fiscal 2019 the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 relates to the cumulative pay down of debt 

loss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2020 was 54 million compared to 126 million in fiscal 2019 in fiscal 2020 we recognized losses of 20 million primarily related to the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the outstanding balance on our term loan facility and 34 million related to the settlement of 6150 million in principal of our 2015 senior convertible debt in fiscal 2019 the losses primarily related to the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the outstanding balance on our term loan facility 

other income net in fiscal 2020 was 32 million compared to other loss net of 22 million in fiscal 2019 the primary reason for the change in other income during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

provision for income taxes 

  

we account for incomes taxes in accordance with asc 740 our provision or benefit for income taxes is attributable to us federal state and foreign income taxes a comparison of our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 and march 31 2019 is not meaningful due to the amount of pretax income and income tax benefits recorded during the period 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes a 408 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 272 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes a 111 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 74 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes a 285 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 190 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 includes 547 million tax expense for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and foreignderived intangible income fdii net of credits which increased our effective tax rate by 364 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 includes a 3348 million tax benefit related to intragroup transfers of certain intellectual property rights which reduced our effective tax rate by 2229 the tax benefit for the intragroup asset transfers was primarily made up of 780 million recorded as a deferred tax asset which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the new applicable statutory tax rate as well as the reversal of the preexisting deferred tax liability of 2599 million which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on applicable statutory tax rate prior to the transfer we expect to be able to realize the future tax benefit of the deferred tax assets resulting from the intragroup asset transfers it is not uncommon for taxing authorities of different countries to have conflicting views for instance with respect to among other things the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied with respect to the valuation of intellectual property rights the taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing the intellectual property rights transferred which could increase our future effective income tax rate and harm future results of operations 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 275 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 134 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 133 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 65 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 751 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 367 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes 954 million tax expense for gilti which increased our effective tax rate by 467 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 906 million tax benefit for business realignment which reduced our effective tax rate by 443 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes 6447 million of tax expense estimated on a provisional basis calculated under sab 118 related to the onetime transition tax on certain foreign earnings 1367 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted us statutory tax rate 

of 210 and 205 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the release of valuation allowances against our foreign tax credit carryforwards these three adjustments increased reduced our effective tax rate by 874 185 and 28 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a 170 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 23 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a 272 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 37 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a 113 million benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 15 

we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations the effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely but they are generally lower than our combined us federal and state effective tax rate our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 was approximately 22 and our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 was approximately 22 our nonus blended statutory tax rates for the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 and march 31 2019 were much lower than this amount the difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors including lower statutory rates tax holidays financing arrangements and other factors our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses 

our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations and assets in thailand malta and ireland our thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future however we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20 we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate microsemi was previously granted a tax holiday in malaysia which expired in december 2019 the remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the us are earnings accrued in ireland at a 125 statutory tax rate and earnings accrued in malta at a 0 to 5 tax rate 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

on july 27 2015 in altera corp v commissioner the us tax court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement in the july 2015 ruling the tax court concluded that the sharing of the cost of employee stock compensation in a company’s costsharing arrangement was invalid under the us administrative procedures act in june 2019 a panel of the ninth circuit of the us court of appeals reversed this decision in july 2019 altera petitioned us court of appeals for the ninth circuit to hold an en banc rehearing of the case in november 2019 the en banc rehearing petition was denied and altera has asked the supreme court for a judicial review due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations and questions related to the scope of potential benefits we have not recorded any adjustments as of march 31 2020 we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 4030 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at march 31 2020  a decrease of 279 million from the march 31 2019 balance 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 154 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to 167 billion for fiscal 2019 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower net sales partially offset by increased operating cash flows resulting from synergies realized from our process efficiencies and restructuring activities related to our acquisition of microsemi as well as working capital management 

net cash used in investing activities was 1332 million for fiscal 2020 compared to 681 billion for fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020 investing cash flows primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets fiscal 2019 investing cash flows included net cash and cash equivalents used to finance our acquisition of microsemi of 785 billion net of 3400 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired offset by net cash inflows of 129 billion due to the sale and maturity of availableforsale debt securities to fund our acquisition of microsemi and capital expenditures of 2289 million 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 676 million and 2289 million in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity the addition of research and development equipment and new office buildings we currently intend to spend between 50 million and 70 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will be sufficient to maintain and operate our internal manufacturing operations support the production capabilities for new products and technologies as well as to selectively bring inhouse some of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations   

  

net cash used in financing activities was 144 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 466 billion for fiscal 2019 the cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019 were favorably impacted by the net proceeds from amounts borrowed to fund our acquisition of microsemi significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include 

 

on may 29 2018  we completed the acquisition of microsemi corporation a publicly traded company headquartered in aliso viejo california we paid an aggregate of approximately 819 billion in cash to the stockholders of microsemi the total consideration transferred in the acquisition including approximately 539 million of noncash consideration for the exchange of certain sharebased payment awards of microsemi for stock awards for our common stock was approximately 824 billion  in addition to the consideration transferred we recognized 323 billion in liabilities in our consolidated financial statements of microsemi consisting of debt taxes payable and deferred pension obligations restructuring and contingent and other liabilities of which 206 billion of existing debt was paid off we financed the purchase price using approximately 810 billion of borrowings consisting of 310 billion of loans under our revolving credit facility 300 billion under the term loan facility and 200 billion in newly issued senior secured notes we incurred 220 million in acquisition costs related to the acquisition during fiscal 2020  we voluntarily prepaid 1880 million of principal under the term loan facility during fiscal 2019 we voluntarily prepaid 109 billion of principal under the term loan facility of which 5000 million was from funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility at march 31 2020  we had 172 billion of outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility compared to 191 billion at march 31 2019  

in march 2020 and september 2019 we amended our credit agreement dated may 29 2018 to among other things reduce the margin added to the interest rate on revolving loans under the credit agreement and amend certain negative covenants including covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to among other things incur subsidiary indebtedness grant 

liens and enter into certain restrictive agreements the amendments also allow us the option to factor receivables and certain related assets the amendments lowered the revolving credit facility thereunder to 357 billion from 360 billion  

the credit agreement provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 357 billion with a 2500 million foreign currency sublimit a 500 million letter of credit sublimit and a 250 million swingline loan sublimit the credit agreement also provides for the term loan facility the revolving credit facility consists of 357 billion of revolving loan commitments the 2023 revolving loans that terminate on may 18 2023 the 2023 maturity date the 2023 revolving loans bear interest at our option at the base rate plus a spread of 000 to 075 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 175 in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period at march 31 2020  we had 239 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility compared to 327 billion at march 31 2019  see note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement 

the enactment of the act in 2017 imposed a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of nonus subsidiaries of us corporations due to this change the jurisdiction in which our cash is at any given point in time no longer has a significant impact on our liquidity future distributions of a significant portion of our nonus assets to the us will no longer be subject to us federal taxation we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations has had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2020  we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

there were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  as of march 31 2020  we held approximately 131 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 42 billion  cash dividends paid per share were 1465  1457 and 1449 during fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively total dividend payments amounted to 3501 million  3444 million and 3375 million during fiscal 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively a quarterly dividend of 03675 per share was declared on may 7 2020 and will be paid on june 4 2020 to stockholders of record as of may 21 2020  we expect the aggregate cash dividend for june 2020 to be approximately 903 million  our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash including the impact of the act demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or convertible debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt or through exchange transactions such issuances or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our ability to negotiate acceptable terms our liquidity position and other factors there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to unfavorable market conditions resulting from the covid19 virus or other factors and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2020  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 



 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase 

rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantees 

  

as of march 31 2020  we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk with the exception of standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us or our subsidiaries we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements based on historical experience and information currently available we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements prior to fiscal 2020 we did not record any liability in connection with various operating leases for buildings and equipment entered into in the ordinary course of business we recorded the associated lease obligations as a liability when we adopted the provisions of the accounting standard update 201602leases which was effective april 1 2019 refer to note 1 and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of this accounting standard

multimarket and other 

our multimarket and other business offers manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits complex programmable logic devices products for aerospace applications and timing systems 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of microsemi and other companies that outsource all or substantial portions of their manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  



 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 microns to 10 microns processes during fiscal 2019  we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 013 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes during fiscal 2019  we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs 

fab 5 is a 6inch wafer fabrication facility that currently utilizes processes from 025 microns to 10 microns during fiscal 2019  we made use of the existing capacity of fab 5 to support demand 

we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries as a result of our acquisitions in recent years we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2019  approximately 57 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

as a result of our acquisition of microsemi we acquired several smaller wafer fabrication facilities which utilize older technologies that are appropriate for the discrete products they manufacture we plan to operate these fabrication facilities with modest investment to keep them operational with the exception of the facility in bend oregon which discontinued production in march 2019 

assembly and test 

  

we perform product assembly and test at various facilities located around the world during fiscal 2019  we increased capacity at our thailand and philippines facilities to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2019  approximately 38 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our internal facilities and approximately 49 of our test requirements were performed in internal facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors for the balance of our assembly and test requirements over time we intend to continue to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our internal facilities 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

the following table summarizes our longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment by geography at the end of fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 in millions 



we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers embedded system engineers eses and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team eses also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

for information regarding our revenue results of operations and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years refer to our financial statements included in this form 10k 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2019  we derived 51 of our net sales through distributors and 49 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2018  we derived 54 of our net sales through distributors and 46 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2017  we derived 55 of our net sales through distributors and 45 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us with the exception of arrow electronics our largest distributor which made up 10 of our net sales no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2019  our backlog was approximately 23789 million compared to 18339 million as of april 30 2018  our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of our sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies some of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates through 2038 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided litigation which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the necessity of engaging in defensive litigation could harm our business 

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2019  we had 18286 employees we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

  

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission   

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock uncertain global economic conditions the ongoing economic recovery and uncertainty surrounding the strength and duration of such recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures including our acquisition of microsemi 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses on may 29 2018 we completed our acquisition of microsemi which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever in addition in april 2016 we completed our acquisition of atmel and in august 2015 we 

completed our acquisition of micrel the integration process for our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction in particular in connection with our microsemi and atmel acquisitions we became involved with thirdparty claims litigation and disputes related to such businesses and transactions see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding pending litigation acquisitions may also result in charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional sharebased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results to fund our acquisition of microsemi we used a significant portion of our cash balances and incurred approximately 810 billion of additional debt we may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our revolving credit facility raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to assets or a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing obligations for preexisting liabilities related to the assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

as of march 31 2019  the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 1166 billion  in connection with our acquisition of microsemi which closed on may 29 2018 we incurred debt consisting of 310 billion under our revolving line of credit 300 billion under our new term loan facility and 200 billion in newly issued senior secured notes at march 31 2019  we had 327 billion in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit which provides 360 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2023 at march 31 2019  we had 191 billion of outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility in february 2017 we issued 265 billion of aggregate principal value of senior and junior convertible debt 

as a result of such transactions we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance our convertible debt senior debt term loan debt or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

servicing our current debt will require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to fund future payments 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our outstanding convertible debt and debt incurred to finance our acquisition of microsemi depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases or acquisitions if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility to future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do the semiconductor industry has experienced significant merger and acquisition activity and consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue product offerings and scale we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have declined over time the overall average selling price of our products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018  approximately 57 and 42  respectively of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries we also use several contractors located primarily in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products specifically during fiscal 2019  approximately 62 of our assembly requirements and 51 of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 58 of our assembly requirements and 36 of our test requirements during fiscal 2018  our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of microsemi atmel micrel smsc supertex and issc the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner on terms favorable to us or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that we desire to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further our use of subcontractors increases the risks of potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for our failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity in fiscal 2019  we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in an unabsorbed capacity charge of 190 million  we operated at normal capacity levels during fiscal 2018  

our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand historically since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business tends to generate stronger revenues in the first and second quarters and comparatively weaker revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition of microsemi have had and can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality as a result in periods when these broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers 

sales to distributors accounted for approximately 51 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 and approximately 54 of our net sales in fiscal 2018  we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in demand for our products from our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

we may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers needs or increase costs due to increased tariffs or other factors 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the relationships that we have with our suppliers also the application of trade restrictions or tariffs by the us or other countries may adversely impact the industry supply chain for example the us government has recently increased tariffs on products that have china as their country of origin and which are imported into the us likewise the china government has increased tariffs on products that have the us as their country of origin and which are imported into china we have taken steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2019 the recent additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china will increase our costs and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the three months ending june 30 2019 or future periods we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our operations this could also impair sourcing flexibility we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts in particular we have recently experienced longer lead times for equipment which we need for capacity expansion at certain of our manufacturing facilities an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

our customers may also be adversely affected by these same issues the materials components and equipment necessary for their businesses could become more difficult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers consolidation in their supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions or application of trade restrictions or tariffs that impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs if our customers are not able to produce their products then their need for our products will decrease such interruptions of our customers’ businesses could harm our business 

interruptions in our it systems unauthorized access to our it systems or improper handling of data could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex it systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by any such disruptions or security breaches additionally any failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations litigation fines and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems for example we have learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers we have engaged experienced legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such matters we have taken steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and as of the date of this filing we are implementing a containment plan we are continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment plan and the amount and content of the information that was compromised and to implement additional remedial actions at this time we do not believe that this it system compromise has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us however we are still evaluating the amount and type of data that was compromised and there can be no assurance as to what the impact of this it system compromise will be as a result of the it system compromise our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer has concluded that our internal controls related to it system access were not effective as of march 31 2019 resulting in a material weakness in our internal controls for additional information refer to item 9a controls and procedures 

were any future attacks to be successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which include but are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus measures patches log monitors event correlation tools routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password modifications as a result of the 

material weakness in our internal controls resulting from the it systems compromise we have taken remediation actions and implemented additional controls there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attacks or disruptions any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of our internal systems defending litigation responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

if we fail to remediate our recently identified material weaknesses and achieve and maintain proper and effective internal control and remediate current or future deficiencies our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results our ability to operate our business and investors views of us 

as discussed in item 9a “controls and procedures” in this report on form 10k in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to it system access internal controls related to such matters are important to accurately reflect our financial position and results of operations in our financial reports we are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses but our efforts may not be successful if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in an appropriate and timely manner or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses our ability to accurately record process and report financial information and consequently our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements subject us to litigation and investigations negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets 

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we are required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors in addition to the recently identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to it system access we have from time to time identified significant deficiencies related to other matters if we fail to remediate our material weaknesses or significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters cybersecurity incidents or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss cyber attacks incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur 

however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technologies and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights product failures our microsemi acquisition contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us our direct or indirect customers or our licensees these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement provide a costeffective remedy or successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries economic damage or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace defense safety security and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including risks from recent increases in tariffs 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2019  approximately 80 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 22 in china and 13 in taiwan during fiscal 2018  approximately 85 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 30 in china and 11 in taiwan in fiscal 2019  our acquisition of microsemi and our transition to sellin revenue recognition contributed to the changes in net sales by country 

  

a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition or economic weakness in the china market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china in particular the trade relationship between the us and china has worsened economic conditions in china remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods the us government has increased tariffs on products that have china as their country of origin and which are imported into the us likewise the china government has increased tariffs on products that have the us as their country of origin and which are imported into china we have taken steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2019 the recent additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china will increase our costs and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the three months ending june 30 2019 or future periods additionally tariffs on our customers products could impact their sales of such end products resulting in lower demand for our products we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs in mitigating the impact of tariffs on our customers 

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past a large portion of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations as part of our atmel acquisition we acquired a test facility in calamba philippines we use various foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer we could face an increase in the cost of components production delays general business interruptions delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs and other barriers and restrictions longer payment cycles increased taxes restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business 

further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

our contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our nondistributor customers and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had over 121000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 11 of our total revenue for fiscal 2019 and six of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that 

perform manufacturing services for many customers cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

we have contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we are not able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have been and may in the future be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement product failure or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages further where we do not have negotiated contracts with our customers the terms of our customers orders may govern the transaction and contain terms that are not favorable to us these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

reliance on government contracts and sales to governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a significant portion of the sales of microsemi which we acquired in may 2018 are from or are derived from government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to us government agencies such sales are subject to uncertainties regarding governmental spending levels spending priorities and policy changes future sales to us government agencies or customers are also subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities including the constraints of the budgetary process changes in the timing and potential spending priorities and the impact of any past or future government shutdowns contract terminations or renegotiations or future sequestrations such sales are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary regulatory tax and trade policies implemented by current or future administrations or by the us congress 

in the past microsemi has experienced delays and reductions in appropriations on programs that included its products for example there were federal government shutdowns from january 20 2018 to january 23 2018 and from december 22 2018 through january 25 2019 further delays reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts including those caused by any past or future shutdown of the us federal government could materially and adversely affect our operating results if the us government fails to complete its annual budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations another federal government shutdown may occur during which time we may experience further delays and reductions in appropriations or reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts which could materially and adversely affect our operating results while we generally function as a subcontractor in these type of transactions further changes in us government procurement regulations and practices particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs may adversely impact the contracting environment and our operating results 

the us government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with microsemi or us at any time for example in 2014 microsemi had a 75 million contract terminated for convenience by the us government uncertainty with respect to government spending and termination of contracts associated with government related projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenue and other benefits we achieve from our microsemi acquisition our business related to us governmental agencies or customers requires us to comply with applicable governmental regulations particularly for our facilities systems and personnel that service such customers maintaining compliance with these regulations including any audit requirements requires that we devote significant resources to such matters in terms of training personnel information technology and facilities any failure to maintain compliance with these requirements may result in fines and penalties and loss of current or future business that may materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the 

services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results 

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro thai baht taiwan dollar and malaysian ringgit the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the us dollar will have on our business or results of operations 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects cybersecurity matters employment risks environmental matters political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with all applicable federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in the quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products energy efficiency measures and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than existing legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices or may charge us more for complying with them the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and 

if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

customer demands and regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 23 2018 other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that we are using conflictfree minerals customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited if we make changes to materials or suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are conflictfree we have incurred and expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the responsible minerals initiative or the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products could levy fines restrict or delay our ability to export or transfer products or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products 

a significant portion of our sales are made through the exporting and importing of products in addition to local jurisdictions trade regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations international traffic in arms regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for certain of our products associated with our microsemi acquisition we rely on us export licenses to ship our products to nonus customers in 2018 there was a federal government shutdown from january 20 2018 to january 23 2018 and a second shutdown from december 22 2018 through january 25 2019 due to the us federal government shutdown the agency that approves these export licenses was temporarily closed this resulted in a delay in certain shipments that were scheduled to ship within the quarter although this delay did not result in a material adverse impact on our revenue in previous quarters it could have a material adverse impact on our revenue within the quarter of any future government shutdown and in the following quarter depending on the ability of the governmental agency to expedite processing of licenses delayed during the shutdown 

the us and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods trade tensions between the us and china escalated in 2018 and 2019 including the us increasing tariffs on chinese origin goods and china increasing tariffs on us goods some of our products were affected and are continuing to be affected by the increased tariffs higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been recently announced or threatened by the us and chinese administrations we have taken steps to mitigate the costs of these tariffs on our business although these increases in tariffs did not result in significant increases to the operating costs of our business they did however adversely impact demand for our products during fiscal 2019 the recent additional tariffs imposed on components or equipment that we or our suppliers source from china will increase our costs and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the three months ending june 30 2019 or future periods increased tariffs on our customers products could impact their sales of their products and increased tariffs on our products in comparison to those of our competitors could each result in lower demand for our products further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers may limit our ability to produce products 

increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

the outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2007 and later we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2007 and later 

we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates financial position and results of operations 

exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities changes in tax rules and regulations including the act changes in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates financial condition and results of operations 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors including but not limited to changes to our corporate operating structure intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies 

our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period our future effective tax rates financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside of the us the adoption of the act significantly changed the taxation of usbased multinational corporations by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate adopting elements of a territorial tax system assessing a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings the new legislation is unclear in some respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service as well as state tax authorities and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation a significant portion of our earnings are earned by our subsidiaries outside the us changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the act along with the state tax impact of these changes and potential future cash distributions will likely have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate furthermore changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations or financial conditions 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

antitakeover defenses in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage takeover attempts which could also reduce the market price of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of microchip these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 

in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time the application of section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 

any of these provisions could under certain circumstances depress the market price of our common stock 

as a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets 

when we acquire a business a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired as of march 31 2019  we had goodwill of 666 billion and net intangible assets of 669 billion  in connection with the completion of our acquisition of microsemi in may 2018 our balance of goodwill and intangible assets increased significantly we review our indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2019  we recognized 31 million of intangible asset impairment charges no material intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2018  if in future periods we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements 

our foreign pension plans are unfunded and any requirement to fund these plans in the future could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

in connection with our acquisitions of microsemi and atmel we assumed defined benefit pension plans that cover certain of our french and german employees plan benefits are managed in accordance with local statutory requirements benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels the projected benefit obligation totaled 727 million at march 31 2019  most of these plans are unfunded in compliance with local statutory regulations and we have no immediate 

intention of funding these plans benefits are paid when amounts become due commencing when participants retire we expect to pay approximately 13 million in fiscal 2020 for benefits earned should legislative regulations require complete or partial funding of these plans in the future it could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

from time to time we receive grants from governments agencies and research organizations if we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits previously paid to us and recognize related charges which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

from time to time we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment at specific locations the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive headcount capital and research and development expenditure and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments noncompliance by us with the conditions of the grants could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business 

climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages and higher costs of water or energy to control the temperature of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as arizona thailand and the philippines some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt our business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

material weaknesses in internal controls 

as discussed in item 9a “controls and procedures” in this report on form 10k in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to it system access internal controls related to such matters are important to accurately reflect our financial position and results of operations in our financial reports we are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses but our efforts may not be successful if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in an appropriate and timely manner or if we identify additional control deficiencies that individually or together constitute significant deficiencies or material weaknesses our ability to accurately record process and report financial information and consequently our ability to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements subject us to litigation and investigations negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price and ability to access capital markets for additional information refer to item 9a controls and procedures 

it system compromise 

we have learned of an ongoing compromise of our computer networks by what is believed to be sophisticated hackers we have engaged experienced legal counsel and a leading forensic investigatory firm with experience in such matters we have taken steps to identify malicious activity on our network including a compromise of our network and as of the date of this filing we are implementing a containment plan we are continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment plan and the amount and content of the information that was compromised and to implement additional remedial actions at this time we do not believe that this it system compromise has had a material adverse effect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us however we are still evaluating the amount and type of data that was compromised and there can be no assurance as to what the impact of this it system compromise will be as described above in connection with the it system compromise our management has concluded that we have a material weakness in our internal controls 

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including general purpose and specialized 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers 32bit microprocessors fieldprogrammable gate array fpga products a broad spectrum of highperformance linear mixedsignal power management thermal management discrete diodes and mosfets radio frequency rf timing timing systems safety security wired connectivity and wireless connectivity devices as well as serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory eeprom serial flash memories parallel flash memories serial electrically erasable random access memory eeram and serial static random access memory sram we also license flaship solutions that are incorporated in a broad range of products we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power usage wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development thus enabling timely and costeffective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products we license our superflash technology and other technologies to wafer 

foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products gate array radio frequency rf and analog products that require embedded nonvolatile memory 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial aerospace office communication and computing our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties our acquisition of microsemi significantly increased the amount of our outsourced manufacturing requirements 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory analog and mixedsignal products fpgas timing systems flaship development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers cems embedded system engineers eses and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for cems and distributor sales teams eses also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

see our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry on page 16 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes senior and junior subordinated 

convertible debt and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition subsequent to our adoption of asu 201409revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 on april 1 2018 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and nondistributor customers direct customers and to a lesser extent from royalties paid by licensees of our intellectual property we apply the following fivestep approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition 1 identify the contract with the customer 2 identify performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied 

sales to our distributors are governed by a distributor agreement a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to distributors do not meet the definition of a contract as defined by asc 606 until the distributor has sent in a purchase order we have acknowledged the order we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created this generally occurs 30 days prior to the estimated ship date as is customary in the semiconductor industry we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors as these are forms of variable consideration we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method usually there is only a single performance obligation in the contract and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation after the transaction price has been allocated we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with distributors is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the distributor 

sales to our direct customers are generally governed by a purchase order and an order acknowledgment sales to direct customers usually do not meet the definition of a contract as defined by asc 606 until shipment of the product occurs generally the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable usually there is only a single performance obligation in the contract and therefore the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation after the transaction price has been allocated we recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer 

revenue generated from our licensees is governed by licensing agreements our primary performance obligation related to these agreements is to provide the licensee the right to use the intellectual property the final transaction price is determined by multiplying the usage of the license by the royalty which is fixed in the licensing agreement revenue is recognized as usage of the license occurs 

revenue recognition  distributors prior to our adoption of asc 606 on april 1 2018 

  

our distributors worldwide generally had broad price protection and product return rights which prevented the sales pricing from being fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to our distributors therefore revenue recognition was deferred until the pricing uncertainty was resolved which generally occurred when the distributor sold the product to their customer at the time of shipment to these distributors we recorded a trade receivable for the selling price as there was a legally enforceable right to payment relieved inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title had passed to the distributor and recorded the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represented the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognized in the subsequent periods was less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

we sold the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resold our products to end customers at a broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales required a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remitted back to 

the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction was completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits were on a per unit basis and were not given to the distributor until they provided information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions varied significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits established the net selling price to our distributors for the product and resulted in the net revenue recognized by us when the product was sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represented the amount of distributors original purchase price that was credited back to the distributors in the subsequent periods we did not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated concessions rather price concessions were typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which was generally at the time the distributor sold the product at march 31 2018 we had approximately 4796 million of deferred revenue and 1458 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 3338 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that was ultimately recognized in our income statement was lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet at march 31 2018 due to additional price credits that were granted to the distributors when the product was sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognized in the distribution channel of our business 

  

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 2039 million at march 31 2018 on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances had no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we processed discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

  

we reduced product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection was granted to distributors on the inventory they had on hand at the date the price protection was offered when we reduced the price of our products it allowed the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it had on hand as of the date of the price reduction there was no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it was reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

  

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluated the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor resulted in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs were recorded at their approximate carrying value 

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows under the 

acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2019  we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values for the past several years we have utilized rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees sharebased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods total sharebased compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2019 was 1664 million  of which 1515 million was reflected in operating expenses and 149 million was reflected in cost of sales total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 124 million at march 31 2019  

during the year ended march 31 2017 we elected to early adopt asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting topic 718  under this standard entities are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on sharebased payment awards as previously required or to recognize forfeitures as they occur we have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur prior to the adoption of asu 201609 we estimated the number of sharebased awards to be forfeited due to employee turnover 

if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 190 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2019 there was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations during the year ended march 31 2019 various foreign jurisdictions finalized their audits the close of these audits did not have an adverse impact on our financial statements we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

the accounting model as defined in accounting standards codification asc 740 related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement generally adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period that results in the position being effectively settled or if the statute of limitation expires due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted into law the act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications including the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 the requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings as a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the act began to impact us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 while other provisions have become effective for us in fiscal 2019 

in addition to the impacts of tax reform on fiscal 2018 the act also establishes new tax laws that are effective for fiscal 2019 including but not limited to 1 a new provision designed to tax lowtaxed income of foreign subsidiaries gilti which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ftcs and a deduction of up to 50 to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 2 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 3 limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and 4 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability while each of these provisions is expected to have an impact on our tax expense in future periods the increase in tax expense for gilti is the most significant 

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap allows taxpayers to make an accounting policy election of either 1 treating taxes due on gilti inclusions as a currentperiod expense when incurred or 2 recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences that are expected to reverse as gilti in future years we are making a policy choice to include taxes due on the future gilti inclusion in taxable income when incurred 

  

senior and junior subordinated convertible debt 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts product liability customer claims and other matters additionally we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims although the outcomes are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation and disputes as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation or disputes in the future 

we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our matters and where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable which generally is based on a probability weighted model if fair value is not determinable contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable 

results of continuing operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

the following table summarizes our net sales for the periods covered by this report dollars in millions 



the increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due primarily to our acquisition of microsemi and was partially offset by our adoption of asc 606 and demand fluctuations in the markets we serve revenue earned from microsemi products accounted for a 394 increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 this increase was partially offset by our adoption of asc 606 on april 1 2018 which affected the timing of revenue recognition with our distributors as 

discussed further in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this form 10k on page 36 to a lesser extent than the adoption of asc 606 net sales and demand were also negatively impacted by general economic conditions trade restrictions and changes in tariffs we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and excluding the impacts of our microsemi acquisition and the adoption of asc 606 there was not any product customer or market that accounted for a material portion of the change the overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual products however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period the overall average selling price of our products increased significantly during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to our acquisition of microsemi whose average selling price is higher than the average selling price of our historical business due to the types of products they offer and the types of customers and markets they serve 

the increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was impacted by the following two accounting factors which occurred in fiscal 2017 

 

excluding the impact of the two accounting factors described above net sales for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 increased 140 this increase was primarily due to growth in our business driven by favorable economic and semiconductor industry conditions approximately 6 of the increase in net sales during this period was due to increases in the overall average selling price of products sold as a result of favorable market conditions and product and geographic mix the remaining sales growth was primarily due to a net increase in the volume of products sold we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any product customer or market that accounted for a material portion of the increase the overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual products however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period 

as discussed in the following paragraphs there were revenue increases across many of our product lines key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 were as follows dollars in millions 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 546  659 and 630 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the decrease in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of microsemi whose microcontroller product line accounted for a relatively low percentage of its total net sales 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 116 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  and increased approximately 220 in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  the increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from our acquisition of microsemi the increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results the average selling price of our microcontroller products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in the average selling price of our microcontroller products in any given period 

analog interface mixed signal and timing products 

  

sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 286  239 and 261 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of microsemi whose analog interface mixed signal and timing product line accounted for a relatively high percentage of its total net sales 

  

net sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products increased approximately 608 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and increased approximately 71 in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  the increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from our acquisition of microsemi the increase in net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains additionally some new analog products which are integrated with a microcontroller core are classified as microcontrollers rather than analog this classification adversely impacted some of the increases in net sales of analog products during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider a majority of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products will increase over time 

fieldprogrammable gate array fpga products 

  

our fpga product line was primarily acquired as part of our acquisition of microsemi on may 29 2018 sales of our fpga products accounted for approximately 57 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  

fpga product pricing has historically been relatively stable because they are proprietary products with significant design in complexity and they are frequently designed into longlived end applications 

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 34  50  and 54 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the decrease in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of microsemi whose product portfolio did not include memory products 

  

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 79 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  and increased approximately 85 in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  the decrease in memory product net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from customer demand conditions the increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies sales of our intellectual property and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 25  26 and 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

  

net sales related to our technology licensing increased approximately 263 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and increased approximately 149 in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time based on the production activities of our licensees the sale of patents and other intellectual property and general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

  

multimarket and other 

  

multimarket and other mmo consists of manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits and products for aerospace applications revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 52  26 and 28 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

net sales related to these services and products increased approximately 1715 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and increased approximately 89 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  the increase in mmo net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from our acquisition of microsemi which significantly increased our portfolio of timing systems products the increase in mmo net sales in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions mmo net sales can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 51 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  approximately 54 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and approximately 55 of our net sales in fiscal 2017  the decrease in this percentage in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is due to our acquisition of microsemi whose distributors accounted for a smaller portion of net sales than microchips historical business with the exception of arrow electronics our largest distributor which made up 10 of our net sales no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2019  our distributors maintained 35 days of inventory of our products compared to 36 days at march 31 2018 and 33 days at march 31 2017  over the past ten fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days prior to our adoption of asc 606 on april 1 2018 we did not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors materially impacted our net sales due to the fact that we recognized revenue based on when the distributor sells the product to their customer upon our adoption of asc 606 commencing on april 1 2018 we are required to recognize revenue from distributors at the time our products are sold to the distributor as a result beginning april 1 2018 inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 were as follows dollars in millions 



americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 80  85 and 84 of our total net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market however sales to asia as a percentage of our total net sales decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to our acquisition of microsemi whose sales to customers in asia accounted for a smaller portion of their total net sales than microchips historical business and to a lesser extent trade restrictions and changes in tariffs sales to customers in the americas increased as a percentage of total sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to our acquisition of microsemi which had more concentration in the aerospace and defense industry in the americas our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

sales to customers in china accounted for approximately 22  30 and 32 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 13  11 and 9 of our net sales in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 in fiscal 2019  our acquisition of microsemi and our transition to sellin revenue recognition contributed to the changes in net sales by country our transition from sellthrough revenue recognition to sellin revenue recognition contributed to the changes in net sales by country because under sellthrough revenue recognition we assigned revenue to the country of our distributors end customer and under sellin revenue recognition we assigned revenue to the country of our distributor for additional information on our transition from sellthrough to sellin revenue recognition refer to note 1 of our consolidated financial statements 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 29313 million in fiscal 2019  24207 million in fiscal 2018 and 17572 million in fiscal 2017  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 548 in fiscal 2019  608 in fiscal 2018 and 516 in fiscal 2017    

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this form 10k were 

  



other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this form 10k include 

  

 

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity in fiscal 2019  we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in an unabsorbed capacity charge of 190 million  during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities operated at normal capacity levels 

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins our wafer fabrication facility located in tempe arizona fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 micron to 10 micron processes our wafer fabrication facility located in gresham oregon fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 013 micron to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production in fab 2 and fab 4 has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90 to 95 our wafer fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado fab 5 currently utilizes processes between 025 micron and 10 micron that run on 6inch wafers we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70 to 75 as a result of our acquisition of micrel in august 2015 we acquired a 6inch wafer fabrication facility in san jose california and have since transitioned products previously manufactured at this facility to our fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 facilities during the quarter ended december 31 2016 we decommissioned this san jose facility and in june 2017 we completed the sale of these assets for proceeds of 100 million 

our overall inventory levels were 7117 million at march 31 2019  compared to 4762 million at march 31 2018 and 4172 million at march 31 2017  our overall inventory levels increased since march 31 2018 because of our acquisition of microsemi which had 1508 million of inventory as of march 31 2019 we maintained 128 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2019 compared to 112 days of inventory at march 31 2018 and 103 days at march 31 2017  we expect our days of inventory levels in the june 2019 quarter to be down 8 days to up 11 days compared to the march 2019 levels we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface mixed signal and timing products fpga products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand the philippines and other locations throughout the world during fiscal 2019  approximately 38 of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities compared to approximately 42 during fiscal 2018 and approximately 36 during fiscal 2017  during fiscal 2019  approximately 49 of our test requirements were performed in our internal test facilities compared to approximately 64 during fiscal 2018 and approximately 60 during fiscal 2017  thirdparty contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly and test operations the percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities 

the decreases in the percentages of assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 were primarily due to our acquisition of microsemi which outsources the majority of its assembly and test requirements the increases in the percentages of assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 were primarily due to investments in assembly and test equipment which increased our internal capacity capabilities we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process we plan to continue to transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements during fiscal 2019  approximately 57 of our total net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 42 during fiscal 2018 and approximately 41 during fiscal 2017  the increases were primarily due to our acquisition of microsemi which outsources the majority of its wafer fabrication requirements 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2019 were 8263 million  or 154 of sales compared to 5293 million  or 133 of sales for fiscal 2018 and 5453 million  or 160 of sales for fiscal 2017  we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increase d 2970 million  or 561  for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of microsemi rd expenses decrease d 160 million  or 29  for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our atmel acquisition and lower sharebased compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated atmel employees during fiscal 2017 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 were 6829 million  or 128 of sales compared to 4521 million  or 114 of sales for fiscal 2018  and 4998 million  or 147 of sales for fiscal 2017  our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses as our revenue increases selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force cems and eses who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses increase d 2308 million  or 511  for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of microsemi including approximately 417 million of acquisitionrelated legal and professional service expenses selling general and administrative expenses decrease d 477 million  or 95  for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our atmel acquisition and lower sharebased compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated atmel employees during fiscal 2017 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2019 was  6741 million compared to  4855 million in fiscal 2018 and  3377 million in fiscal 2017  the primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was our acquisition of microsemi the primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was amortization of inprocess rd assets from our acquisition of atmel 

special charges and other net 

  

during fiscal 2019  we incurred special charges and other net of 337 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges of 639 million offset by 302 million in legal contingencies our restructuring expenses during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 were related to our most recent business acquisitions and resulted from workforce property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations during fiscal 2018  we incurred special charges and other net of 175 million comprised primarily of a 195 million charge for fees associated with transitioning from a public utility provider in oregon to a lower cost direct access provider during fiscal 2017  we 

incurred special charges and other net of 986 million comprised primarily of restructuring charges these restructuring charges included employee separation costs contract exit costs other operating expenses and intangible asset impairment losses recognized as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after our acquisition of atmel that affected the use and life of these assets

interest income in fiscal 2019 was 81 million compared to 220 million in fiscal 2018 and 31 million in fiscal 2017  the primary reason for the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 relates to lower average cash and investment balances as we used a substantial portion of our cash to help finance the purchase price of our acquisition of microsemi the primary reason for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to higher cash and investment balances 

interest expense in fiscal 2019 was 5029 million compared to 1990 million in fiscal 2018 and 1463 million in fiscal 2017  the primary reason for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 relates to our additional borrowings to help finance our acquisition of microsemi the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to our issuance of 26450 million of convertible notes in february 2017 partially offset by lower interest expense on amounts borrowed under our credit facility 

loss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2019 was 126 million compared to 160 million in fiscal 2018 and 439 million in fiscal 2017  in fiscal 2019  we recognized a loss of 126 million primarily related to the voluntary prepayment of a portion of the outstanding balance on our term loan facility in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  we settled 1438 million and 4313 million respectively in principal of our 2007 junior subordinated convertible debt 2007 junior debt total conversions for fiscal 2018 were for a principal amount of 325 million for which we settled the principal amount in cash and issued 05 million shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversions occurring prior to the call notice and 410 million in cash for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversion requests received after the call notice in june 2017 we exchanged in privately negotiated transactions 1113 million aggregate principal amount of our 2007 junior debt for i 1113 million principal amount of our 2017 junior subordinated convertible debt 2017 junior debt with a market value of 1193 million plus ii the issuance of 32 million shares of our common stock with a value of 2546 million  in the case of the fiscal 2017 settlement the principal value of 4313 million was settled in cash and we issued shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount plus a cash inducement fee of 50 million 

other loss net in fiscal 2019 was 22 million compared to other loss net of 58 million in fiscal 2018 and other income net of 13 million in fiscal 2017  the primary reasons for the change in other loss during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 relates to lower losses on investments offset by lower net gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the primary reasons for the change in other income loss during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 relates to impairments on available for sale investments partially offset by gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the impairments on the available for sale investments were due to the anticipated liquidation of these investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to fund our acquisition of microsemi 

provision for income taxes 

  

our provision for income taxes reflects tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended march 31 2019 and march 31 2018 were not meaningful due to the amount of pretax income and the tax benefits recorded during the period excluding certain tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 275 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 134 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 133 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 65 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 751 million tax benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 367 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes 954 million tax expense for gilti which increased our effective tax rate by 467 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 includes a 906 million tax benefit for business realignment which reduced our effective tax rate by 443 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes 6447 million of tax expense estimated on a provisional basis calculated under sab 118 related to the onetime transition tax on certain foreign earnings 1367 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted us statutory tax rate 

of 210 and 205 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the release of valuation allowances against our foreign tax credit carryforwards these three adjustments increased reduced our effective tax rate by 874 185 and 28 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a 170 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 23 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a 272 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 37 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a 113 million benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 15 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included 363 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and 79 million of expense related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization which reduced our effective tax rate by 404 and increased our effective tax rate by 88 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a 128 million benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 143 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also included a 250 million benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 278 

we are also subject to taxation in many other jurisdictions where we have operations the effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely but they are generally lower than our combined us federal and state effective tax rate our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 was approximately 22 and our domestic statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 was approximately 33 our nonus blended statutory tax rates for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were much lower than this amount the difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors including lower statutory rates historical loss carryforwards financing arrangements and other factors our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses 

our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations in thailand malta and ireland our thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future however we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays or we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20 we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate our microsemi operations in malaysia are also subject to a tax holiday that effectively reduces microsemi’s income tax rate in that jurisdiction microsemi’s tax holiday in malaysia was granted in 2009 and is effective through december 2019 subject to continued compliance with the tax holiday’s requirements the remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the us are earnings accrued in ireland at a 125 statutory tax rate and earnings accrued in malta at a 0 tax rate 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

results of discontinued operations 

discontinued operations represent the mobile touch operations that we acquired as part of our acquisition of atmel on november 10 2016 we completed the sale of the mobile touch assets to solomon systech limited international a hong kong based semiconductor company the transaction included the sale of certain semiconductor products equipment customer list backlog patents and a license to certain other intellectual property and patents related to atmels mobile touch product line we also agreed to provide certain transition services to solomon systech for financial statement purposes the results of operations for this discontinued business have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended march 31 2017 was 60 million  consisting of a pretax loss from operations of 82 million and a pretax gain on sale of 06 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 4309 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at march 31 2019  a decrease of 177 billion from the march 31 2018 balance the decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to our acquisition of microsemi 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 167 billion for fiscal 2019  142 billion for fiscal 2018 and 106 billion for fiscal 2017  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to cash provided by our acquisition of microsemi in fiscal 2019  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher net sales as well as operating cash flows resulting from synergies realized from our process efficiencies and restructuring efforts related to our acquisition of atmel 

net cash used in investing activities was 681 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to 101 billion for fiscal 2018 and 284 billion in fiscal 2017  fiscal 2019 investing cash flows included net cash and cash equivalents used to finance our acquisition of microsemi of 785 billion net of 3400 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired offset by net cash inflows of 129 billion due to the sale and maturity of availableforsale debt securities to fund our acquisition of microsemi and capital expenditures of 2289 million  fiscal 2018 investing cash flows primarily result from the net increase in investments of 8081 million due to cash from operations as well as capital purchases fiscal 2017 investing cash flows include net cash and cash equivalents used to finance our acquisition of atmel of 275 billion  excluding cash flows used in acquisitions net investing activities resulted in net cash provided of 104 billion in fiscal 2019 and a use of 905 million in fiscal 2017  and represented primarily the net change in our investments capital purchases and sale of assets 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 2289 million  2068 million  and 753 million in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity the addition of research and development equipment and new office buildings capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 were relatively less than we had experienced in recent years as we delayed certain purchases until we had finalized and developed plans following our acquisition of atmel regarding technology platforms and other manufacturing activities we currently intend to spend between 130 million and 150 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring inhouse more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 466 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 4153 million for fiscal 2018 and net cash provided by financing activities of 5955 million for fiscal 2017  fiscal 2018 financing cash outflows were primarily the result of dividend payments and payments on the settlement of our convertible debt fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 cash flows were favorably impacted by the net proceeds from amounts borrowed to fund our acquisitions of microsemi and atmel respectively significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include 

 

on may 29 2018 we completed the acquisition of microsemi corporation a publicly traded company headquartered in aliso viejo california we paid an aggregate of approximately 819 billion in cash to the stockholders of microsemi the total consideration transferred in the acquisition including approximately 539 million of noncash consideration for the exchange of certain sharebased payment awards of microsemi for stock awards for our common stock was approximately 824 billion in addition to the consideration transferred we recognized 323 billion in liabilities in our consolidated financial statements of microsemi consisting of debt taxes payable and deferred pension obligations restructuring and contingent and other liabilities of which 206 billion of existing debt was paid off we financed the purchase price using approximately 810 billion of borrowings consisting of 310 billion of loans under our revolving credit facility 300 billion under the term loan facility and 200 billion in newly issued senior secured notes we incurred 220 million in acquisition costs related to the acquisition during fiscal 2019 we voluntarily prepaid 109 billion of principal 

under the term loan facility of which 5000 million was from funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility at march 31 2019  we had 191 billion of outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility 

in may 2018 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which provides for the revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 384 billion which was reduced to 360 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 through the termination of the 2020 tranche with a 2500 million foreign currency sublimit a 500 million letter of credit sublimit and a 250 million swingline loan sublimit the credit agreement also provides for the term loan facility the revolving credit facility consists of 360 billion of revolving loan commitments the 2023 revolving loans that terminate on may 18 2023 the 2023 maturity date the 2023 revolving loans bear interest at our option at the base rate plus a spread of 000 to 100 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 200 in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period at march 31 2019  we had 327 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and no borrowings at march 31 2018  see note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement 

in june 2017 in connection with the settlement of 1113 million of our convertible debt we amended our credit agreement to i extend the time period during which we are permitted to repurchase redeem or exchange our 2007 junior convertible debt and ii amend the maximum total leverage ratio covenant to extend the time period for permitted refinancings or exchanges of the 2007 junior convertible debt that may be excluded from the calculation of the ratio subject to certain conditions 

in february 2017 we amended our credit agreement to among other things increase certain covenant compliance ratios the february 2017 amendment included a new collateral agreement that secures our borrowings with all assets of our guarantor subsidiaries with the exception of real property proceeds of loans made under our credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 

the enactment of the act in december 2017 imposed a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of nonus subsidiaries of us corporations due to this change the jurisdiction in which our cash is at any given point in time no longer has a significant impact on our liquidity future distributions of nonus assets to the us will no longer be subject to us federal taxation we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the us in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts as a result of the act as of march 31 2018 we recognized a onetime provisional transition tax expense of 6447 million on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings as we concluded with our measurement period in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab 118 we finalized our calculations of the transition tax expense during the period ended december 31 2018 as such we increased our march 31 2018 provisional amount by 131 million to 6578 million of which we expect cash payments of approximately 2807 million after offsets by the utilization of various tax attribute carryforwards in the united states this tax is to be paid over a period of eight years with 8 of the transition tax paid each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023 and 15 20 and 25 respectively to be paid during fiscal 2024 2025 and 2026 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations has had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2019  we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

on april 4 2016 we completed our acquisition of atmel under the terms of the merger agreement executed on january 19 2016 atmel stockholders received 815 per share consisting of 700 per share in cash and 115 per share in shares of microchip common stock we financed the purchase price of our atmel acquisition using approximately 204 billion of cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries approximately 094 billion from additional borrowings under our credit agreement and approximately 4861 million through the issuance of an aggregate of 101 million shares of our common stock the acquisition price represented a total equity value of approximately 347 billion and a total enterprise value of approximately 344 billion after excluding atmels cash and investments net of debt on its balance sheet of approximately 393 million the acquisition was structured in a manner that enabled us to utilize a substantial portion of the cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner although we believe our determinations with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition are reasonable we are regularly audited by the irs and may be audited by other taxing authorities and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such audit 

there were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 as of march 31 2019  we held approximately 156 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 38 billion  cash dividends paid per share were 1457  1449 and 1441 during fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  respectively total dividend payments amounted to 3444 million  3375 million  3154 million during fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  respectively a quarterly cash dividend of 03655 per share was declared on may 7 2019 and will be paid on june 4 2019  to stockholders of record as of may 21 2019  we expect the aggregate cash dividend for june 4 2019 to be approximately 870 million  our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash including the impact of the act demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2019  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 



1 operating lease obligations include 181 million of future lease payments which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as of march 31 2019  this obligation is due under an operating lease from our acquisition of atmel for a building in san jose california 



 10 during fiscal 2018 we recognized a provisionary onetime transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings estimated at 6447 million as a result of the recent us tax reform as of december 31 2018 with the conclusion of the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 we increased this amount by 131 million to 6578 million of which we expect cash payments of approximately 2807 million after offsets by the utilization of various tax attribute carryforwards in the united states our first payment on this obligation of 350 million was made in the quarter ended september 30 2018 and we expect future cash payments of approximately 2457 million this tax is to be paid over a period of eight years with 8 of the transition tax paid each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023 and 15 20 and 25 respectively to be paid during fiscal 2024 2025 and 2026 

11 the contractual obligations do not include amounts related to uncertain tax positions because reasonable estimates cannot be made 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantees 

  

as of march 31 2019 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk with the exception of various operating leases for buildings and equipment entered into in the ordinary course of business additionally we may provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us or our subsidiaries we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements based on historical experience and information currently available we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and incur expenses throughout the lives of the operating leases we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases we will record the associated lease obligations as a liability when we adopt the provisions of the accounting standard update 201602leases refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of this accounting standard

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k as required by paragraph b of rule 13a15 or rule 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act we evaluated under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e of the exchange act based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives will be met 

material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 

a material weakness as defined in rule 12b2 under the exchange act is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

in reviewing the accounting for certain transactions completed in fiscal 2019 as part of the realignment of our legal structure and other significant transactions our management identified deficiencies in the operating effectiveness of controls intended to properly document and review relevant facts used to determine and apply the appropriate tax accounting under accounting standards generally accepted in the united states additionally our controls did not operate to validate the completeness and accuracy of information used in the execution of certain key tax controls these control deficiencies impacted the deferred tax longterm income tax payable and income tax benefit accounts and related disclosures and resulted in adjustments to our annual financial statements as of and for the year ended march 31 2019 the errors arising from the underlying deficiencies are not material to the financial statements reported in any interim or annual period and therefore did not result in a revision to previously filed financial statements however the control deficiencies could result in a failure to timely prevent or detect misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that could be material to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements accordingly our management has concluded that the deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we also identified deficiencies in the design of our internal control over financial reporting as our management determined that there were not sufficient controls to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized access to our it systems in a timely manner network authentication segmentation and monitoring were in place but were not sufficiently designed to address changes in the current risk environment our management has concluded that these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 

accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission registrants are permitted to exclude material business combinations from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of microsemi which we acquired on may 29 2018 as discussed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements we have included the financial results of microsemi in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenues excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting represented approximately 28 of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 total microsemi assets excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting represented approximately 4 of our consolidated total assets as of march 31 2019 

  

based on our assessment and the existence of a material weakness related to accounting for income taxes and the existence of a material weakness related to it system access management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of managements assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

  

ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2019  which is included on page f2 

remediation plans and other information 

our management has begun implementing a remediation plan to address the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness related to accounting for income taxes as described above the remediation plan includes 

 

with respect to the foregoing material weakness we currently plan to have our enhanced review procedures and documentation standards in place in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 our goal is to remediate this material weakness by the end of fiscal 2020 subject to there being sufficient opportunities to conclude through testing that the enhanced control is operating effectively 

our management has also begun implementing a remediation plan to address the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness related to it system access as described above the remediation plan includes

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

on may 29 2018 we completed our acquisition of microsemi which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls during the three months ended march 31 2019 we transitioned certain of microsemis processes to our internal control processes and we expect to transition more of such processes throughout the remainder of calendar year 2019 

in connection with the identified material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to it system access we have taken steps to remediate the material weaknesses as described above however other than with respect to our transition of microsemi to our systems and control environment as describe above during the three months ended march 31 2019  there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of rule 13a15 or rule 15d15 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

multimarket and other 

our multimarket and other business offers manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits complex programmable logic devices and products for aerospace applications 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of companies that outsource all or substantial portions of their manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 microns to 10 microns processes during fiscal 2018  we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 013 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes during fiscal 2018  we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs 

fab 5 is a 6inch wafer fabrication facility that currently utilizes processes from 025 microns to 10 microns during fiscal 2018  we made use of the existing capacity of fab 5 to significantly increase wafer starts to support demand 

we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries as a result of our acquisitions in recent years we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2018  approximately 42  of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

wafer probe assembly and test 

  

we perform wafer probe product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand and we perform wafer probe and testing at our facility in calamba philippines we also perform a limited amount of wafer probe and testing at our chandler arizona facility and our colorado springs colorado facility during fiscal 2018  we increased our thailand and philippines facilities capacity to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2018  approximately 42  of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facilities and approximately 64  of our test requirements were performed in our thailand and philippines facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements over time we intend to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our thailand and philippines facilities 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the 

semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

the following table summarizes our longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment by geography at the end of fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  in millions 



we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers in such event we have plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of general purpose and specialized microcontrollers 32bit microprocessors wired and wireless connectivity products analog interface mixed signal timing and security products human machine interface security serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design assembly test and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2018  our rd expenses were 5293 million  compared to  5453 million  in fiscal 2017  and  3726 million  in fiscal 2016  rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of  425 million  in fiscal 2018   468 million  in fiscal 2017  and  320 million  in fiscal 2016  

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers cems embedded system engineers eses and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team eses also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

for information regarding our revenue results of operations and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years refer to our financial statements included in this form 10k 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2018  we derived 54  of our net sales through distributors and 46  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2017  we derived 55  of our net sales through distributors and 45  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2016  we derived 53  of our net sales through distributors and 47  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  or fiscal 2016  

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  were as follows dollars in millions 



sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 85  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  and 84  of net sales in each of fiscal 2017  and 2016  our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 30  32  and 30  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 11  9  and 12  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016   

our international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand our business tends to generate historically stronger revenues in the first and second quarters and comparatively weaker revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition of atmel and our pending acquisition of microsemi can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2018  our backlog was approximately 18339 million compared to 16241 million as of april 30 2017 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of our sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates through 2037 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided litigation which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the necessity of engaging in defensive litigation could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2018  we had 14234 employees we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

  

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission   

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock uncertain global economic conditions the ongoing economic recovery and uncertainty surrounding the strength and duration of such recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures including our pending acquisition of microsemi 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses on march 1 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire microsemi we expect the acquisition of microsemi to close in june 2018 in addition in april 2016 we completed our acquisition of atmel and in august 2015 we completed our acquisition of micrel the integration process for our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction in particular as a result of our atmel acquisition we became involved with thirdparty claims litigation and disputes related to the atmel business see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding pending litigation acquisitions may also result in charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional sharebased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results to fund our pending acquisition of microsemi we plan to use a significant portion of our cash balances and incur approximately 80 billion of additional debt through borrowings under our credit agreement and issuance of new debt we may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our credit agreement raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to assets or a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing obligations for preexisting liabilities related to the assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

as of march 31 2018  the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 44813 million  in february 2017 we issued 26450 million of aggregate principal value of senior and junior convertible debt and amended our existing credit agreement to among other things increase certain covenant compliance ratios the february 2017 credit agreement amendment included a new collateral agreement that secures our borrowings with all assets of our guarantor subsidiaries with the exception of real property we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 senior and junior convertible debt to settle 4313 million in principal value of our 2007 junior debt and 16825 million to pay off the outstanding balance under our credit facility at march 31 2018  there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility which had a capacity of 31223 million and is comprised of one tranche expiring in february 2020 in connection with the closing of our pending acquisition of microsemi we expect to incur approximately 80 billion of additional debt through borrowings under our credit agreement and issuance of new debt as a result of such transactions we will have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance our convertible debt or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

servicing our current debt and expected debt to finance the microsemi acquisition will require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to fund future payments 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our outstanding debentures and expected debt to be incurred to finance our acquisition of microsemi depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases or acquisitions if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility to future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do the semiconductor industry has experienced significant merger and acquisition activity and consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue product offerings and scale we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have declined over time the overall average selling price of our products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  approximately 42  and 41  respectively of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries we also use several contractors located primarily in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products specifically during fiscal 2018  approximately 58  of our assembly requirements and 36  of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 64  of our assembly requirements and 40  of our test requirements during fiscal 2017  our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of atmel micrel smsc supertex and issc microsemi relies on wafer foundries for a significant portion of its wafer fabrication needs accordingly upon completion of our acquisition of microsemi our reliance on third party contractors and foundries will increase significantly the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner on terms favorable to us or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that we desire to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further our use of subcontractors increases the risks of potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for our failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity although we operated at normal capacity levels during fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  there can be no assurance that such production levels will be maintained in future periods 

our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business tends to generate historically stronger revenues in the first and second quarters and comparatively weaker revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity including our acquisition of atmel and our pending acquisition of microsemi can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality as a result in periods when these broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 54 of our net sales in fiscal 2018  and approximately 55 of our net sales in fiscal 2017  we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in demand for our products from our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the relationships that we have with our suppliers this could impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts in particular we have recently experienced longer lead times for equipment which we need for capacity expansion at certain of our manufacturing facilities an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices including asc 606 which will impact our revenue recognition 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409  revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the unites states of america us gaap the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services upon our adoption of asu 201409 beginning with our fiscal year commencing on april 1 2018 we will no longer defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer but rather will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new guidance and its expected impact on us 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss cyber attacks incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technologies and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights product failures contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us our direct or indirect customers or our licensees these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement provide a costeffective remedy or successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries economic damage or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace defense safety security and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2018  approximately 85  of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 30  in china during fiscal 2017  approximately 84  of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 32  in china 

a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition or economic weakness in the china market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china in particular economic conditions in china remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods 

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past a large portion of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations as part of our atmel acquisition we acquired a test facility in calamba philippines we use various foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

our contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had over 119000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 11 of our total revenue for fiscal 2018  and five of our top ten direct customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

we have contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we are not able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have been and may in the future be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement product failure or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages further where we do not have negotiated contracts with our customers the terms of our customers orders may govern the transaction and contain terms that are not favorable to us these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

with respect to our pending acquisition of microsemi a significant portion of their sales are or may be derived from us government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to us government agencies such sales are subject to significant uncertainties regarding government spending and policy changes also the us government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with microsemi at any time uncertainty with respect to governmental spending and policies or termination of contracts associated with governmental projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenues and other benefits that we achieve from the microsemi acquisition prior to the microsemi transaction microchip has not derived significant sales from government related customers 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results    

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the us dollar will have on our business or results of operations 

interruptions in our information technology systems or improper handling of data could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by any such disruptions or security breaches additionally any failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations litigation fines and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems however such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us were future attacks successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus measures patches log monitors event correlation tools routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password modifications there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attacks or disruptions any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of our internal systems defending litigation responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects employment risks environmental matters political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control or remediate current or future deficiencies our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results our ability to operate our business and investors’ views of us 

ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we are required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors although we have never identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we have from time to time identified significant deficiencies if we fail to remediate these significant deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with all applicable federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in the quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products energy efficiency measures and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than existing legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices or may charge us more for complying with them the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue 

opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

customer demands and regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 31 2017 other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that we are using conflictfree minerals customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited if we make changes to materials or suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are conflictfree we have incurred and expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the responsible minerals initiative or the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export or transfer products 

a significant portion of our sales are made through the exporting and importing of products in addition to local jurisdictions trade regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear international traffic in arms regulations itar and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and denied entities administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2005 and later we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2007 and later 

we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these or any future examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates financial position and results of operations 

exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities changes in tax rules and regulations including the act changes in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could affect our effective tax rates financial condition and results of operations 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors including but not limited to changes to our corporate operating structure intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies 

our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period our future effective tax rates financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside of the us recently enacted us tax legislation will significantly change the taxation of usbased multinational corporations by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate adopting elements of a territorial tax system assessing a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings the new legislation is unclear in some respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service as well as state tax authorities and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation a significant portion of our earnings are earned by our subsidiaries outside the us changes to the taxation of certain foreign earnings resulting from the newly enacted us tax legislation along with the state tax impact of these changes and potential future cash distributions will likely have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate furthermore changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations or financial conditions 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

antitakeover defenses in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage takeover attempts which could also reduce the market price of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of microchip these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 

in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time the application of section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 

any of these provisions could under certain circumstances depress the market price of our common stock 

as a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets including impairments related to microsemi following our completion of our acquisition of such company 

when we acquire a business a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired as of march 31 2018  we had goodwill of 22990 million and net intangible assets of 16620 million  in connection with the completion of our pending acquisition of microsemi our balance of goodwill and intangible assets will increase significantly we review our indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2018  or in fiscal 2017  no material intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2017  we recognized 119 million of intangible asset impairment charges if in future periods we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements 

our foreign pension plans are unfunded and any requirement to fund these plans in the future could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

in connection with our acquisition of atmel we assumed unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain of our french and german employees plan benefits are managed in accordance with local statutory requirements benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels the projected benefit obligation totaled 610 million  at march 31 2018  the plans are unfunded in compliance with local statutory regulations and we have no immediate intention of funding these plans benefits are paid when amounts become due commencing when participants retire we expect to pay approximately 09 million in fiscal 2019  for benefits earned should legislative regulations require complete or partial funding of these plans in the future it could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

from time to time we receive grants from governments agencies and research organizations if we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits previously paid to us and recognize related charges which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

from time to time we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment at specific locations the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive headcount capital and research and development expenditure and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments noncompliance by us with the conditions of the grants could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount 

of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business 

climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages and higher costs of water or energy to control the temperature of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as arizona thailand and the philippines some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt our business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

recent developments 

on march 1 2018 we entered into the merger agreement to acquire microsemi for 6878 per share in cash the acquisition price represents a total equity value of approximately 835 billion and a total enterprise value of about 1015 billion after accounting for microsemi’s cash and investments net of debt on its balance sheet at december 31 2017 microsemi offers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor and system solutions for aerospace and defense communications data center and industrial markets microsemi recorded net sales of 4922 million for its second fiscal quarter ended april 1 2018 compared to 4429 million for its second fiscal quarter ended april 2 2017 and net sales of 9609 million for the six months ended april 1 2018 compared to 8784 million for the six months ended april 2 2017 microsemi is headquartered in aliso viejo california and has approximately 4800 employees globally 

the board of directors of each of microchip and microsemi have unanimously approved the merger and the merger agreement the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and approval by microsemi stockholders there is no financing condition to the closing of the merger assuming the timely receipt of the aforementioned regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of the other closing conditions we anticipate that the merger will be completed in late mayearly june 2018 

we plan to finance the acquisition of microsemi with a combination of cash and cash equivalents new borrowings on our line of credit and the issuance of new debt for further details see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources 

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including general purpose and specialized microcontrollers development tools and related software analog interface mixed signal and timing products wired and wireless connectivity products memory products and technology licensing we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power usage wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development thus enabling timely and costeffective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products we license our superflash technology and other technologies to wafer foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products gate array radio frequency rf and analog products that require embedded nonvolatile memory 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office communication computing and aerospace our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory analog and mixedsignal products flaship systems development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers cems embedded system engineers eses and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for cems and distributor sales teams eses also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

see our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry on page 17 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to original equipment manufacturers oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights which prevent the sales pricing from being fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to our distributors therefore revenue recognition is deferred until the pricing uncertainty is resolved which generally occurs when the distributor sells the product to their customer at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

in connection with our acquisitions of atmel and micrel we acquired certain distributor relationships where revenue was recognized upon shipment to the distributors based on certain contractual terms or prevailing business practices that resulted in the price being fixed and determinable at such time following an acquisition we undertake efforts to align the contract terms and business practices of the acquired entity with our own once these efforts are complete revenue recognition is changed with respect to such distributor relationships acquired in the atmel acquisition as of october 1 2016 these business practices were conformed to those of our other distributors resulting in the deferral of revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers with respect to such distributor relationships acquired in the micrel acquisition in the december 2015 quarter 

these distributor contracts were changed to be consistent with those of our other distributors which resulted in the deferral of revenue recognition under such contracts until the distributor sells the product to their customers 

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributors in the future we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2018  we had approximately 4796 million  of deferred revenue and 1458 million  in deferred cost of sales recognized as 3338 million  of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2017  we had approximately 4180 million  of deferred revenue and 1252 million  in deferred cost of sales recognized as 2928 million  of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 2039 million  at march 31 2018 and march 31 2017  on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

recent updates to revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date  which delayed the effective date of the new standard by one year to december 15 2017 for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after that date in accordance with the delay the new standard was effective for the company beginning april 1 2018 the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new standard allows for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201608 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net  which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in april 2016 the fasb issued asu 201610 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 identifying performance obligations and licensing  which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations in may 2016 the fasb issued asu 201612 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 narrowscope improvements and practical expedients  which addresses implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and discussed by the revenue recognition transition resource group   for a discussion of the financial statement impact related to the adoption of these standards see “recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted” in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows under the acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2018  we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values for the past several years we have utilized rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees sharebased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods total sharebased compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2018  was 932 million  of which 794 million  was reflected in operating expenses and 138 million  was reflected in cost of sales total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 81 million  at march 31 2018  

during the year ended march 31 2017 we elected to early adopt asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting topic 718  under this standard entities are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on sharebased payment awards as previously required or to recognize forfeitures as they occur we have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur prior to the adoption of asu 201609 we estimated the number of sharebased awards to be forfeited due to employee turnover 

if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 19 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2016 we operated at slightly below normal capacity levels in our thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 resulting in approximately 10 million in charges to cost of sales there was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in each of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized due to the tax cuts and jobs act the act we released our valuation allowance on foreign tax credits during the period ending march 31 2018 which was provisional we are still evaluating how the act impacts our valuation allowance on state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits and we may report an adjustment to the valuation allowances under staff accounting bulletin sab 118 in subsequent quarters should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations during the year ended march 31 2018 various foreign jurisdictions finalized their audits the close of these audits did not have an adverse impact on our financial statements we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

the accounting model as defined in accounting standards codification asc 740 related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the 

taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement generally adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period or if the statute of limitation expires due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted into law the act provides for numerous significant tax law changes and modifications including the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 the requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings as a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the act began to impact us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal 2019 

the corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of january 1 2018 since we have a fiscal year rather than a calendar year we are subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates as a result our fiscal 2018 federal statutory rate will be a blended rate of 315 

in addition to the impacts of tax reform on fiscal 2018 the act also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal 2019 including but not limited to 1 a new provision designed to tax lowtaxed income of foreign subsidiaries which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ftcs and a deduction of up to 50 to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 2 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 3 limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and 4 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability while each of these provisions is expected to have an impact on our tax expense for fiscal 2019 and future periods we expect the tax on lowtaxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most significant adverse impact 

due to the complexity of the new tax on lowtaxed income of foreign subsidiaries we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the act and the application of asc 740 based on recent fasb deliberations it appears we will be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income as a currentperiod expense when incurred or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes our selection of an accounting policy will depend in part on analyzing our facts to determine what the impact is expected to be under each method 

  

senior and junior subordinated convertible debt 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts product liability customer claims and other matters additionally we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims although the outcomes are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation and disputes as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation or disputes in the future 

we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our matters and where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable which generally is based on a probability weighted model if fair value is not determinable contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable 

results of continuing operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

the following table summarizes our net sales for the periods covered by this report dollars in millions 



the increases in net sales in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  were impacted by the following two accounting factors which occurred in fiscal 2017 

 

excluding the impact of the two accounting factors described above net sales for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  increased 140 this increase was primarily due to growth in our business driven by favorable economic and semiconductor industry conditions approximately 6 of the increase in net sales during this period was due to increases in the overall average selling price of products sold as a result of favorable market conditions and product and geographic mix the remaining sales growth was primarily due to a net increase in the volume of products sold we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any product customer or market that accounted for a material portion of the increase the overall average selling price of our products is affected by pricing declines over the life of individual 

products however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period 

excluding the impact of the two accounting factors described above net sales for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  increased 607 this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of atmel and also due to growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions average selling prices were not a material factor in the sales growth as they were flat in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 sales growth was primarily driven by the increase in the number of units of our semiconductor products sold in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 as a result of our acquisition of atmel and growth in our historical business 

as discussed in the following paragraphs there were revenue gains across our product lines with the largest dollar value increase in microcontrollers which is our largest product line this growth was due to favorable economic and semiconductor conditions and market share gains key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows dollars in millions 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 659  630  and 619  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased  approximately 220  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and increased  approximately 596  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  resulted primarily from our acquisition of atmel and also by growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results the average selling price of our microcontroller products is affected by these trends however variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can cause wider fluctuations in the average selling price of our microcontroller products in any given period 

analog interface mixed signal and timing products 

  

sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 239  261  and 274  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

  

net sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products increased  approximately 71  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and increased  approximately 493  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains the increase in net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by our acquisition of atmel and also by growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions additionally some new analog products which are integrated with a microcontroller core are classified as microcontrollers rather than analog this classification adversely impacted some of the increases in net sales of analog products during fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider a majority of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products will increase over time 

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 50  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  and approximately 54  of our net sales in each of fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  

  

net sales of our memory products increased  approximately 85  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and increased  approximately 575  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  the increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by our acquisition of atmel 

  

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 26  27  and 41  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

  

net sales related to our technology licensing increased  approximately 149  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and increased  approximately 24  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time based on the production activities of our licensees as well as general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

  

multimarket and other 

  

multimarket and other mmo consists of manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits complex programmable logic devices and products for aerospace applications revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 26  28  and 12  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

net sales related to these services and products increased  approximately 89 million  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and increased  approximately 700 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  the increase  in mmo net sales in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  resulted primarily from growth in our business driven by general economic and 

semiconductor industry conditions the increase  in mmo net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by our acquisition of atmel mmo net sales can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 54  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  approximately 55  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  and approximately 53  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  no single distributor accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2018  2017  or 2016  our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2018  our distributors maintained 36  days of inventory of our products compared to 33  days at march 31 2017  and 32  days at march 31 2016  over the past ten fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27  days and 47  days prior to our adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  on april 1 2018 we did not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors materially impacted our net sales due to the fact that we recognized revenue based on when the distributor sells the product to their customer upon our adoption of topic 606 commencing on april 1 2018 we will be required to recognize revenue from distributors at the time our products are sold to the distributor as a result beginning april 1 2018 inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows dollars in millions 



americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 85  of our total net sales in fiscal 2018  and 84 of our total net sales in each of fiscal 2017  and 2016  substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 30  32  and 30  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 11  9  and 12  of our net sales in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 24207 million  in fiscal 2018  17572 million  in fiscal 2017  and 12055 million  in fiscal 2016  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 608  in fiscal 2018  516  in fiscal 2017  and 555  in fiscal 2016  

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this form 10k were 

  

 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this form 10k include 

  

 

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities operated at normal capacity levels which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment during the third quarter of fiscal 2016  our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels in response to uncertain global economic conditions and our inventory position at the time as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 19 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2016 we operated at slightly below normal capacity levels in our thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 resulting in approximately 10 million in charges to cost of sales 

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins our wafer fabrication facility located in tempe arizona fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 micron to 10 micron processes our wafer fabrication facility located in gresham oregon fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 013 micron to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production in fab 2 and fab 4 has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90 to 95 our wafer fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado fab 5 currently utilizes processes between 025 micron and 10 micron that run on 6inch wafers we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70 to 75 as a result of our acquisition of micrel in august 2015 we acquired a 6inch wafer fabrication facility in san jose california and have since transitioned products previously manufactured at this facility to our fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 facilities during the quarter ended december 31 2016 we decommissioned this san jose facility and in june 2017 we completed the sale of these assets for proceeds of 100 million 

our overall inventory levels were 4762 million  at march 31 2018  compared to 4172 million  at march 31 2017  and 3068 million at march 31 2016  we maintained 112 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2018  compared to 103 days of inventory at march 31 2017  and 110 days at march 31 2016  we expect our days of inventory levels in the june 2018  quarter to be down six days to up four days compared to the march 2018 levels we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface mixed signal and timing products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand and philippines and as a result of our acquisition of atmel we acquired a test facility in calamba philippines during fiscal 2018  approximately 42 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 36 during fiscal 2017 and approximately 53 during fiscal 2016  the 

percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities thirdparty contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations during fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  approximately 64  and 60  respectively of our test requirements were performed in our thailand and philippines facilities compared to approximately 81  of our test requirements performed in our thailand facilities during fiscal 2016  the increase in the percentage of assembly and test work that was performed internally in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  is primarily due to our recent investments in assembly and test equipment which have increased our internal capacity capabilities the primary reason for the percentage reduction in the assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  is our acquisition of atmel which outsourced most of these activities we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements during fiscal 2018  approximately 42  of our total net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 41  during fiscal 2017  and approximately 39  during fiscal 2016  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2018  were 5293 million  or 133  of sales compared to 5453 million  or 160  of sales for fiscal 2017  and 3726 million  or 171  of sales for fiscal 2016  we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses decrease d 160 million  or 29  for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our atmel acquisition and lower sharebased compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated atmel employees during fiscal 2017 our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses as our revenue increases rd expenses increase d 1727 million  or 463  for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to additional compensation and other costs from our acquisition of atmel rd as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to our restructuring activities and synergies realized following the acquisitions of atmel and micrel 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018  were 4521 million  or 114  of sales compared to 4998 million  or 147  of sales for fiscal 2017  and 3017 million  or 139  of sales for fiscal 2016  selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force cems and eses who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses decrease d 477 million  or 95  for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  due primarily to reductions in personnel and associated costs in connection with synergies realized from our atmel acquisition and lower sharebased compensation expense due to accelerated vesting of equity awards held by terminated atmel employees during fiscal 2017 our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our operating expenses as our revenue increases selling general and administrative expenses increase d 1981 million  or 657  for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  due primarily to additional costs from our acquisition of atmel 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2018  was  4855 million  compared to  3377 million  in fiscal 2017  and  1749 million  in fiscal 2016  the primary reason for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was amortization of inprocess rd assets from our acquisition of atmel which assets started to amortize during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 the primary reasons for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  were increased amortization from our acquisitions of atmel and micrel partially offset by decreased amortization from our customerrelated intangible assets from our acquisitions of standard microsystems corporation smsc and issc technologies corporation issc 

special charges and other net 

  

during fiscal 2018  we incurred special charges and other net of 175 million  comprised primarily of a 195 million charge for fees associated with transitioning from a public utility provider in oregon to a lower cost direct access provider during fiscal 2017  we incurred special charges and other net of 986 million  comprised primarily of restructuring charges our restructuring activities include workforce property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations in connection with these activities we incurred employee separation costs contract exit costs other operating expenses and intangible asset impairment losses the impairment losses were recognized as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition of atmel that affected the use and life of these assets during fiscal 2016  we incurred special charges and other net of  40 million  comprised of  112 million  of restructuring charges associated with our acquisition activity and legal settlement costs of approximately  43 million  partially offset by special income and other net of  115 million  related to an insurance settlement for reimbursement of funds we previously paid to settle a lawsuit in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 

  

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2018  was 220 million  compared to 31 million  in fiscal 2017  and 244 million  in fiscal 2016  the primary reason for the increase  in interest income in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  relates to higher cash and investment balances the primary reason for the decrease  in interest income in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  relates to lower invested cash balances as we used cash to finance a significant portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of atmel 

interest expense in fiscal 2018  was 1990 million  compared to 1463 million  in fiscal 2017  and 1040 million in fiscal 2016  the primary reasons for the increase  in interest expense in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  relates to our issuance of 26450 million of convertible notes in february 2017 partially offset by lower interest expense on amounts borrowed under our credit facility in february 2017 we paid off the remaining balance on our credit facility the primary reasons for the increase  in interest expense in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  relates to higher interest expense on amounts borrowed under our credit facility to partially finance our acquisition of atmel as well as the aforementioned issuance of convertible notes in february 2017 

loss on settlement of convertible debt in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  was 160 million  and 439 million  respectively in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  we settled 1438 million and 4313 million respectively in principal of our 2007 junior subordinated convertible debt 2007 junior debt total conversions for fiscal 2018 were for a principal amount of 325 million for which we settled the principal amount in cash and issued 05 million  shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversions occurring prior to the call notice and 410 million  in cash for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount for the conversion requests received after the call notice in june 2017 we exchanged in privately negotiated transactions 1113 million  aggregate principal amount of our 2007 junior debt for i 1113 million  principal amount of our 2017 junior subordinated convertible debt 2017 junior debt with a market value of 1193 million  plus ii the issuance of 32 million  shares of our common stock with a value of 2546 million  in the case of the fiscal 2017 settlement the principal value of 4313 million was settled in cash and we issued shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount plus a cash inducement fee of 50 million 

other loss net  in fiscal 2018  was 58 million  compared to other income net  of 13 million  in fiscal 2017  and other income net  of 89 million  in fiscal 2016  the primary reasons for the change in other income loss during fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  relates to impairments on available for sale investments partially offset by gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the impairments on the available for sale investments are due to the anticipated liquidation of these investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to fund our pending acquisition of microsemi the primary reason for the change 

in other income loss during fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  relate to the lower realized gains on the sale of marketable equity and debt securities 

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes reflects tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings we had an effective tax rate of 654 in fiscal 2018 a 900 benefit in fiscal 2017 and a 152 benefit in fiscal 2016 excluding certain tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 includes 6447 million of tax expense estimated on a provisional basis calculated under sab 118 related to the onetime transition tax on certain foreign earnings 1367 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted us statutory tax rate of 210 and 205 million of tax benefit estimated on a provisional basis related to the release of valuation allowances against our foreign tax credit carryforwards these three adjustments increased reduced our effective tax rate by 874 185 and 28 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 also includes a 170 million tax benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 23 our effective tax rate in 2018 also includes a 272 million tax benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 37 our effective tax rate in 2018 also includes a 113 million benefit related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 15 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included 363 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and 79 million of expense related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization which reduced our effective tax rate by 404 and increased our effective tax rate by 88 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a 128 million benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 143 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also included a 250 million benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduced our effective tax rate by 278 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 included 121 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and 155 million of benefits related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization which reduced our effective rate by 43 and 55 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 also included a 25 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit and a 135 million benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 09 and 48 respectively 

we are also subject to taxation in many other jurisdictions where we have operations the effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely but they are generally lower than our combined us federal and state effective tax rate our domestic statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 was approximately 33 and our domestic statutory tax rate for fiscal 2017 was approximately 37 our nonus blended statutory tax rates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were much lower than this amount the difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors including lower statutory rates historical loss carryforwards financing arrangements and other factors our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses 

our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations in thailand cayman and ireland our thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future however we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays or we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20 we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate the remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the us are earnings accrued in ireland at a 125 statutory tax rate and earnings accrued by microchip’s offshore technology company which was resident in the cayman islands at a 0 statutory tax rate the tax rate differential in ireland thailand and cayman plus the tax holiday in thailand make up approximately 100 of the 2088 million benefit of foreign income taxed at a lower rate than the federal rate for fiscal 2018 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2005 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions at this time we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law if this threshold is not met 

no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized if the threshold is met we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

results of discontinued operations 

discontinued operations represent the mobile touch operations that we acquired as part of our acquisition of atmel on november 10 2016 we completed the sale of the mobile touch assets to solomon systech limited international a hong kong based semiconductor company the transaction included the sale of certain semiconductor products equipment customer list backlog patents and a license to certain other intellectual property and patents related to atmels mobile touch product line we also agreed to provide certain transition services to solomon systech for financial statement purposes the results of operations for this discontinued business have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended march 31 2017  was 60 million  consisting of a pretax loss from operations of 82 million and a pretax gain on sale of 06 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 21966 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at march 31 2018  an   increase  of 7863 million  from the march 31 2017  balance of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and long term investments the increase  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations of 14196 million offset by dividend payments of 3375 million 2068 million in capital payments and 734 million on the settlement of a portion of our convertible debt 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 14196 million  for fiscal 2018  10595 million  for fiscal 2017  and 7444 million  for fiscal 2016  the increase in net cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher net sales as well as operating cash flows resulting from synergies realized from our process efficiencies and restructuring efforts related to our acquisition of atmel the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to operating cash flows resulting from our acquisitions of atmel and micrel and operating synergies from our process efficiency and restructuring efforts 

net cash used in investing activities was 10117 million  for fiscal 2018  compared to 28380 million  for fiscal 2017  and net cash provided by investing activities of 8004 million  in fiscal 2016  fiscal 2018 net investing cash flows primarily result from the net increase in investments of 8081 million  due to cash from operations as well as capital purchases fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 investing cash flows include net cash and cash equivalents used to finance acquisitions of 27475 million  and 3619 million  respectively excluding cash flows used in acquisitions net investing activities resulted in a use of 905 million  in fiscal 2017 and net cash provided of 11623 million  in fiscal 2016 and represented primarily the net change in our investments capital purchases and sale of assets 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 2068 million  in fiscal 2018  753 million  in fiscal 2017  and 979 million  in fiscal 2016  capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity the addition of research and development equipment and new office buildings capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 were relatively less than we have experienced in recent years as we delayed certain purchases until we had finalized and developed plans following our acquisition of atmel regarding technology platforms and other manufacturing activities we currently intend to spend approximately 2250 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring inhouse more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 4153 million  for fiscal 2018  compared to net cash provided from financing activities of 5955 million  for fiscal 2017  and net cash used in financing activities of 599 million  for fiscal 2016  fiscal 2018 financing cash outflows were primarily the result of dividend payments and payments on the settlement of our convertible debt fiscal 2017 cash flows were favorably impacted by the net proceeds of debt issued that year significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include 



 

on may 18 2018 we  entered into an amended and restated credit agreement which   provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 38 billion with a 2500 million foreign currency sublimit a 500 million letter of credit sublimit and a 250 million swingline loan sublimit the r evolving l oan f acility consists of approximately 2443 million of revolving loan commitments the “ 2020 revolving loans ” that terminate on february 4 2020 the “ 2020 maturity date ” and approximately 36 billion of revolving loan commitments the “ 2023 revolving loans ” and together with the 2020 revolving loans the “ revolving loans ” that terminate on may 18 2023 the “ 2023 maturity date ” the revolving loans bear interest at our  option at a in the case of 2020 revolving loans the base rate plus a spread of 025 to 125 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 125 to 225 and b in the case of 2023 revolving loans the base rate plus a spread of 000 to 100 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 100 to 200 in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated senior leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period 

in june 2017 in connection with the settlement of 1113 million of our convertible debt we amended our credit agreement to i extend the time period during which we are permitted to repurchase redeem or exchange our 2007 junior debt and ii amend the maximum total leverage ratio covenant to extend the time period for permitted refinancings or exchanges of the 2007 junior debt that may be excluded from the calculation of the ratio subject to certain conditions 

in february 2017 we amended our credit agreement to among other things increase certain covenant compliance ratios the february 2017 amendment included a new collateral agreement that secures our borrowings with all assets of our guarantor subsidiaries with the exception of real property proceeds of loans made under our credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes at march 31 2018  and 2017 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement 

the enactment of the recent us tax reform act in december 2017 imposes a tax on all previously untaxed earnings of nonus subsidiaries of us corporations due to this change the jurisdiction in which our cash is at any given point in time no longer has a significant impact on our liquidity future distributions of nonus assets to the us will no longer be subject to us federal taxation as a result of the act we recognized a onetime transition tax expense of 6447 million on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings this value is identified as provisional in our consolidated financial statements for the period ended march 31 2018 and is subject to future measurement period adjustments in accordance with sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 we intend to elect to pay this tax over a period of eight years with 8 of the transition tax paid each year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023 and 15 20 and 25 respectively to be paid during fiscal 2024 fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 

in february 2016 we terminated our tenyear fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements which were related to a portion of our fixedrate 1625 2015 senior subordinated convertible debt the interest rate swap agreements were designated as fair value hedges we paid variable interest equal to the threemonth libor minus 536 basis points and we received a fixed interest rate of 1625 upon termination the contracts were in an asset position resulting in cash receipts of approximately 257 million which included 37 million of accrued interest the cash flows from the termination of these interest rate swap agreements have been reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations has had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2018  we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

on april 4 2016 we completed our acquisition of atmel under the terms of the merger agreement executed on january 19 2016 atmel stockholders received 815 per share consisting of 700 per share in cash and 115 per share in shares of microchip common stock we financed the purchase price of our atmel acquisition using approximately 204 billion of cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries approximately 094 billion from additional borrowings under our credit agreement and approximately 4861 million through the issuance of an aggregate of 101 million shares of our common stock the acquisition price represented a total equity value of approximately 347 billion and a total enterprise value of approximately 344 billion after excluding atmels cash and investments net of debt on its balance sheet of approximately 393 million the acquisition was structured in a manner that enabled us to utilize a substantial portion of the cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner although we 

believe our determinations with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition are reasonable we are regularly audited by the irs and may be audited by other taxing authorities and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such audit 

on august 3 2015 we acquired micrel for 1400 per share and paid an aggregate of approximately 4300 million in cash and issued an aggregate of 86   million   shares of our common stock to micrel shareholders we financed the cash portion of the purchase price with amounts borrowed under our credit agreement 

on march 1 2018 in connection with our execution of the merger agreement we entered into a commitment letter with jpmorgan pursuant to which jpmorgan committed to provide to us among other things 1 a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 50 billion and 2 a 364day secured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 6250 million in each case subject to the execution of definitive documentation and customary closing conditions jpmorgan’s commitments in respect of the term loan facility will be reduced in the event we raise certain other debt or equity financing 

we estimate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the acquisition of microsemi and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be approximately 1015 billion to 

 we expect to finance the foregoing through a combination of 

 as of march 31 2018 microchip and microsemi had combined cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of approximately 24198 million 

in may 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in january 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 150 million shares of common stock from the approximately 114 million shares remaining under the current authorization as of march 31 2016 we had repurchased 86 million shares under this authorization for approximately 3638 million there were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 there is no expiration date associated with this repurchase program 

as of march 31 2018  we held approximately 182 million  shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 35 billion  cash dividends paid per share were 1449  1441  and 1433  during fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively total dividend payments amounted to 3375 million  3154 million  2911 million  during fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively on may 8 2018  we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 03635  per share which will be paid on june 4 2018  to stockholders of record on may 21 2018  and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 856 million  our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

as discussed above we plan to finance our pending acquisition of microsemi through a combination of incurrence of loans under a new term loan facility revolving loans under microchips amended and restated credit agreement the issuance of the 

senior secured debt and microchips and microsemis cash and cash equivalents on hand at closing other than such financing required to fund our microsemi acquisition we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash including the impact of the act demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2018  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2018  dollars in millions 



1 operating lease obligations include 233 million of future lease payments which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as of march 31 2018 this obligation is due under an operating lease from the acquisition of atmel for a building in san jose california 



year for fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2023 and 15 20 and 25 respectively to be paid during fiscal 2024 2025 and 2026 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantees 

  

as of march 31 2018  we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk in the ordinary course of business we may provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us or our subsidiaries we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements based on historical experience and information currently available we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements

multimarket and other 

our multimarket and other business offers manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits complex programmable logic devices and aerospace products 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of companies that outsource all or substantial portions of their manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 microns to 10 microns processes during fiscal 2017 we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 013 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes during fiscal 2017  we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs 

fab 5 was acquired as a result of our acquisition of atmel corporation atmel in april 2016 fab 5 is a 6inch wafer fabrication facility that currently utilizes processes from 025 microns to 10 microns during fiscal 2017 we made use of the existing capacity of fab 5 to significantly increase wafer starts we also added capital equipment and made clean room improvements to support products transferred from our acquisition of micrel incorporated micrel in august 2015 

we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

as a result of our acquisition of micrel we acquired a 6inch wafer fabrication facility in san jose california and have since transitioned products previously manufactured at this facility to our fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 facilities during the quarter ended december 31 2016 we decommissioned this san jose facility and subsequent to march 31 2017 we completed the sale of these assets for proceeds of 100 million as of march 31 2017 these assets consisting of property plant and equipment were presented as held for sale in our consolidated financial statements 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we augment our internal manufacturing capabilities by outsourcing a portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries as a result of our acquisitions in recent years we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2017  approximately 41  of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

wafer probe assembly and test 

  

we perform wafer probe product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand and we perform wafer probe and testing at our facility in calamba philippines which came to us through our atmel acquisition we also perform a limited amount of wafer probe and testing at our chandler arizona facility and our colorado springs colorado facility during fiscal 2017  we increased our thailand and philippines facilities capacity to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2017  approximately 36  of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facilities and approximately 60  of our test requirements were performed in our thailand and philippines facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements the primary reasons for the percentage reductions in the assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 are our acquisitions of atmel and micrel which outsourced most of these activities over time we intend to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our thailand and philippines facilities 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

the following table summarizes our longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment by geography at the end of fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  in thousands 



we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers in such event we have plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of general purpose and specialized microcontrollers 32bit microprocessors wired and wireless connectivity products analog interface mixed signal timing and security products human machine interface security serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design assembly test and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2017  our rd expenses were 5453 million  compared to  3726 million  in fiscal 2016  and  3495 million  in fiscal 2015  rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of 468 million  in fiscal 2017   320 million  in fiscal 2016  and  282 million  in fiscal 2015  

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers cems embedded system engineers eses and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team eses also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

for information regarding our revenue results of operations and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years refer to our financial statements included in this form 10k 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2017  we derived 55  of our net sales through distributors and 45  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2016  we derived 53  of our net sales through distributors and 47  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2015  we derived 51  of our net sales through distributors and 49  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  or fiscal 2015  

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  were as follows dollars in thousands 



sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84  of our net sales in each of fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 32  30  and 28  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increases in sales to customers in china including hong kong in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were due primarily to our continued focus on the chinese market as a key component to our global growth strategy and our acquisition of atmel which had a slightly higher percentage of its net sales going to china including hong kong sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 9  12  and 14  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the decreases in sales to customers in taiwan in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were due primarily to our acquisitions of atmel and micrel which had lower percentages of their net sales going to taiwan we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

our international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity including our acquisitions of atmel and micrel can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality as a result in periods when these broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2017  our backlog was approximately 16241 million compared to 12123 million as of april 30 2016 backlog increased significantly due to our acquisition of atmel during fiscal 2017 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of our sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates through 2036 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided litigation which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the necessity of engaging in defensive litigation could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2017  we had 12656 employees we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock our acquisition of atmel uncertain global economic conditions the ongoing economic recovery and uncertainty surrounding the strength and duration of such recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for our failure to meet contractual shipment 

deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity although we operated at normal capacity levels during the last three quarters of fiscal 2015 the first two quarters of fiscal 2016 the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and throughout fiscal 2017 there can be no assurance that such production levels will be maintained in future periods 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures including our acquisition of atmel 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses on april 4 2016 we acquired atmel which was our largest and most complex acquisition ever in addition in august 2015 we completed our acquisition of micrel in july 2014 we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in issc in april 2014 we completed our acquisition of supertex inc and in august 2012 we completed our acquisition of smsc the integration process for our acquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction in particular as a result of our atmel acquisition we became involved with thirdparty claims litigation and disputes related to the atmel business see item 1 legal proceedings for information regarding pending litigation acquisitions may also result in charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional sharebased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results to fund our acquisition of atmel we used a significant portion of our cash balances borrowed under our credit agreement and issued approximately 101 million shares of our common stock additionally we may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our credit agreement raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business including the divestiture of our atmel mobile touch assets or the planned divestiture of our micrel wafer fabrication facility we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to assets or a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing obligations for preexisting liabilities related to the assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

as of march 31 2017 the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was 45138 million in february 2017 we issued 26450 million of aggregate principal value of senior and junior convertible debt and amended our existing 27740 million credit agreement to among other things increase certain covenant compliance ratios the february 2017 credit agreement amendment included a new collateral agreement that secures our borrowings with all assets of our guarantor subsidiaries with the exception of real property we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 senior and junior convertible debt to settle 4313 million in principal value of our 2007 junior convertible debt and 16825 million to pay off the outstanding balance under the credit facility at march 31 2017  there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility which is comprised of two tranches expiring in february 2020 and june 2018 the maturity date of the original credit agreement in february 2015 we issued 17250 million of principal value of our 2015 senior convertible debt as a result of such transactions we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past our maintenance 

of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance our convertible debt or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to fund future payments 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our outstanding debentures depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases or acquisitions if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility to future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do the semiconductor industry has experienced significant merger and acquisition activity and consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue product offerings and scale we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 



historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have declined over time 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 approximately 41  and 39  of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries respectively we also use several contractors located primarily in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products specifically during fiscal 2017 approximately 64  of our assembly requirements and 40  of our test requirements were performed by third party contractors compared to approximately 47  of our assembly requirements and 19  of our test requirements during fiscal 2016 our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of atmel micrel smsc supertex and issc the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner on terms favorable to us or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that we desire to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further our use of subcontractors increases the risks of potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity including our acquisitions of atmel and micrel can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality as a result in periods when these broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 55  of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and approximately 53  of our net sales in fiscal 2016 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technologies and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the relationships that we have with our suppliers this could impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts in particular we have recently experienced longer lead times for equipment which we need for capacity expansion at certain of our manufacturing facilities an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights product failures contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us our direct or indirect customers or our licensees these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement provide a costeffective remedy or successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries economic damage or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace defense safety security and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2017 approximately 84  of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 32  in china including hong kong during fiscal 2016 approximately 84  of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 30  in china including hong kong 

a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition or economic weakness in the china market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china in particular economic conditions in china remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods 

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past a large portion of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we use various foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 



 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers but where we do certain terms of such contracts expose us to risks and liabilities 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had approximately 115000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 12 of our total revenue for fiscal 2017 and six of our top ten customers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale further as a result of our acquisitions we have inherited certain customer contracts that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we are not able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have been and may in the future be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement product failure or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss cyber attacks incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results    

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that the strength of the dollar will have on our business or results of operations 

interruptions in our information technology systems or improper handling of data could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by any such disruptions or security breaches additionally any failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations litigation fines and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems however such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us were future attacks successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus measures patches log monitors routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password modifications there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attacks or disruptions any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of our internal systems defending litigation responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects employment risks environmental matters political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with many federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in the quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products energy efficiency measures and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than existing legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices or may charge us more for complying with them the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

customer demands and regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on may 26 2016 other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that we are using conflictfree minerals customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited if we make changes to materials or suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are conflictfree we have incurred and expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different 

manner than advocated by the conflict free smelter initiative or the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear international traffic in arms regulations itar and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with these or other export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2005 and later we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2007 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates and potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings that could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside of the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries however changes to the us income tax regulations and jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our tax provisions and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition other factors or events including business combinations changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in available tax credits and changes in tax rates could also increase our future effective tax rate 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

antitakeover defenses in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage takeover attempts which could also reduce the market price of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of microchip these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 

in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time the application of section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 

any of these provisions could under certain circumstances depress the market price of our common stock 

as a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangible assets 

when we acquire a business a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired as of march 31 2017 we had goodwill of 22990 million  and net intangible assets of 21481 million  we review our indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016 in fiscal 2017 we recognized 119 million of intangible asset impairment charges if in future periods we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements 

our foreign pension plans are unfunded and any requirement to fund these plans in the future could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

in connection with our acquisition of atmel we assumed unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain of our french and german employees plan benefits are managed in accordance with local statutory requirements benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels the projected benefit obligation totaled 504 million at march 31 2017 the plans are unfunded in compliance with local statutory regulations and we have no immediate intention of funding these plans benefits are paid when amounts become due commencing when participants retire we expect to pay approximately 07 million in fiscal 2018 for benefits earned should legislative regulations require complete or partial funding of these plans in the future it could negatively affect our cash position and operating capital 

from time to time we receive grants from governments agencies and research organizations if we are unable to comply with the terms of those grants we may not be able to receive or recognize grant benefits or we may be required to repay grant benefits previously paid to us and recognize related charges which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 

from time to time we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment at specific locations the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive headcount capital and research and development expenditure and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits and these programs can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments noncompliance by us with the conditions of the grants could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409  revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which will supersede nearly all existing revenue guidance under us gaap the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services upon adoption of asu 201409 we will no longer defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer but rather will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the standard may have on our consolidated financial statements we currently expect to adopt the standard under the full retrospective method the final adoption method will depend on the results of our final assessment which is expected to be completed later in fiscal 2018 refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new guidance and its potential impact on us 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business 

climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages and higher costs of water or energy to control the temperature of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as arizona and thailand some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations however if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any of the legal proceedings described below or in other legal proceedings or matters that were not deemed material to us as of the date hereof then such legal proceedings or matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

as a result of our acquisition of atmel which closed on april 4 2016 we became involved with the following lawsuits 

in re continental airbag products liability litigation  on may 11 2016 an amended and consolidated class action complaint complaint was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida miami division against atmel continental automotive systems inc honda motor co ltd and an affiliate and daimler ag and an affiliate the complaint which includes claims arising under federal law and florida california new jersey michigan and louisiana state lawalleges that class members unknowingly purchased or leased vehicles containing defective airbag control units incorporating allegedly defective application specific integrated circuits manufactured by our atmel subsidiary between 2006 and 2010 and thereby suffered financial harm including a loss in the value of their purchased or leased vehicles the plaintiffs are seeking individually and on behalf of a putative case unspecified compensatory and exemplary damages statutory penalties pre and postjudgment interest attorneys fees and injunctive and other relief our atmel subsidiary contested plaintiffs claims vigorously and on may 23 2017 the case was ordered to be dismissed 

continental claim icc arbitration on december 29 2016 continental automotive gmbh continental filed a request for arbitration with the icc naming as respondents our subsidiaries atmel corporation atmel sarl atmel global sales ltd and atmel automotive gmbh collectively “atmel” the request alleges that a quality issue affecting continental airbag control units in certain recalled vehicles stems from allegedly defective atmel application specific integrated circuits “asics” the continental airbag control units asics and vehicle recalls are also at issue in in re continental airbag products liability litigation  described above continental seeks to recover from atmel all related costs and damages incurred as a result of the vehicle manufacturers’ airbag control unitrelated recalls currently alleged to be 616 million but subject to increase our atmel subsidiaries intend to defend this action vigorously 

southern district of new york action by lfoundry rousset lfr and lfr employees  on march 4 2014 lfr and jeanyves guerrini individually and on behalf of a putative class of lfr employees filed an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the district court against our atmel subsidiary our french subsidiary atmel rousset sas atmel rousset and lfoundry gmbh lf lfrs german parent the case purports to relate to atmel roussets june 2010 sale of its wafer manufacturing facility in rousset france to lf and lfrs subsequent insolvency and later liquidation more than three years later the district court dismissed the case on august 21 2015 and the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the dismissal on june 27 2016 on july 25 2016 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the district courts june 27 2016 denial of their motion for relief from the dismissal judgment on may 19 2017 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the june 27 2016 order dismissing the case 

individual labor actions by former lfr employees  in the wake of lfrs insolvency and liquidation over 500 former employees of lfr have filed individual labor actions against atmel rousset in a french labor court our atmel rousset subsidiary believes that each of these actions is entirely devoid of merit and further that any assertion by any of the claimants of a coemployment relationship with our atmel rousset subsidiary is based substantially on the same specious arguments that the paris commercial court summarily rejected in 2014 in related proceedings our atmel rousset subsidiary therefore intends to defend vigorously against each of these claims

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 –  business item 6 –  selected financial data and item 8 –  financial statements and supplementary data 

  

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 39 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the sections titled liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including general purpose and specialized microcontrollers development tools and related software analog interface mixed signal and timing products wired and wireless connectivity products memory products and technology licensing we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power usage wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development thus enabling timely and costeffective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products we license our superflash technology and other technologies to wafer foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products gate array radio frequency rf and analog products that require embedded nonvolatile memory 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office communication computing and aerospace our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory analog and mixedsignal products flaship systems development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement manager cems embedded system engineer eses and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for cems and distributor sales teams eses also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

see our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry on page 15 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes senior and junior subordinated convertible debt and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to original equipment manufacturers oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights which prevent the sales pricing from being fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to our distributors therefore revenue recognition is deferred until the pricing uncertainty is resolved which generally occurs when the distributor sells the product to their customer at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

in connection with our acquisitions of atmel and micrel we acquired certain distributor relationships where revenue was recognized upon shipment to the distributors based on certain contractual terms or prevailing business practices that result in the price not being fixed and determinable at such time following an acquisition we undertake efforts to align the contract terms and business practices of the acquired entity with our own once these efforts are complete revenue recognition is changed with respect to such distributor relationships acquired in the atmel acquisition as of october 1 2016 these business practices were conformed to those of our other distributors resulting in the deferral of revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers with respect to such distributor relationships acquired in the micrel acquisition in the december 2015 quarter these distributor contracts were changed to be consistent with those of our other distributors which resulted in the deferral of revenue recognition under such contracts until the distributor sells the product to their customers 

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributors in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against 

deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2017  we had approximately 4180 million  of deferred revenue and 1252 million  in deferred cost of sales recognized as 2928 million  of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2016  we had approximately 2672 million  of deferred revenue and 838 million  in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1834 million  of deferred income on shipments to distributors the increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  resulted primarily from our acquisition of atmel the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 2039 million  at march 31 2017 and 1029 million  at march 31 2016  the increase in distributor advances in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  resulted primarily from our acquisition of atmel on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of operations we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

  

recent updates to revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  and in august 2015 the fasb subsequently issued asu 201514 “deferral of the effective date” which supersedes existing revenue guidance pursuant to us gaap and will no longer permit us to defer revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end customer upon adoption of asu 201409 and 201514 a portion of this deferred revenue will be required to be estimated and recognized upon sale to the distributor rather than upon the sale by the distributor to the end customer see “recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted” for additional information on the new guidance 

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the 

measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows under the acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2017  we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values for the past several years we have utilized rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees sharebased compensation cost is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense straightline over the requisite service periods total sharebased compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2017 was 1282 million  of which 1095 million was reflected in operating expenses and 187 million  was reflected in cost of sales total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 82 million at march 31 2017  

during the year ended march 31 2017  we elected to early adopt asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting topic 718  under this standard entities are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on sharebased payment awards as previously required or to recognize forfeitures as they occur we have elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur prior to the adoption of asu 201609 we estimated the number of sharebased awards to be forfeited due to employee turnover the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the years ended march 31 2016 and 2015 was immaterial 

if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of production below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 19 million and 08 million was charged directly to cost of sales in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively there was no charge to cost of sales for reduced production levels in fiscal 2017 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and state tax credits where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized at march 31 2017  the valuation allowances totaled 2101 million should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations during the year ended march 31 2017  the us internal revenue service irs finalized the audit of our 2011 and 2012 income tax years the close of this audit did not have an adverse impact on our financial statements also during the year ended march 31 2017 the german and french tax authorities finalized the audit of our 2010 through 2013 and our 2012 through 2014 income tax years respectively the close of these audits did not have an adverse impact on our financial statements we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in france we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

the accounting model as defined in asc 740 related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement generally adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period or if the statute of limitation expires due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model 

  

senior and junior subordinated convertible debt 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts product liability customer claims and other matters additionally we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or from customers requesting 

reimbursement for various costs with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims although the outcomes are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation and disputes as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation or disputes in the future 

we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our matters and where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable which generally is based on a probability weighted model if fair value is not determinable contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable 

results of continuing operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

  

our net sales of  34078 million  in fiscal 2017   increased  by  12345 million  or 568  compared to fiscal 2016  and our net sales of  21733 million  in fiscal 2016   increased  by  263 million  or 12  compared to fiscal 2015  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was due primarily to our acquisition of atmel and also by growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was due primarily to our acquisition of micrel offset in part by weaker general economic and semiconductor industry conditions average selling prices for our semiconductor products were flat in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and down approximately 3 in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was up approximately 58 in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and up approximately 6 in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows dollars in thousands 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 630  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  approximately 619  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  and approximately 649  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased  approximately 596  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and decreased  approximately 35  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  resulted primarily from our acquisition of atmel and also by growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the decrease  in net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  resulted primarily from weaker general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve including the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products 

  

sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 261  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  approximately 274  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  and approximately 233  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  

  

net sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products increased  approximately 493  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and increased  approximately 188  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by our acquisition of atmel and also by growth in our historical business driven by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the increase in net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was driven primarily by our acquisition of micrel in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and market share gains achieved within the analog interface mixed signal and timing market 

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider the majority of our analog interface mixed signal and timing product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products will increase over time 

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 54  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  approximately 54  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  and approximately 62  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  

  

net sales of our memory products increased  approximately 574  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and decreased  approximately 116  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  the increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by our acquisition of atmel the decrease in memory product net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was driven primarily by adverse customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets 

  

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 27  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  approximately 41  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  and approximately 42  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  

net sales related to our technology licensing increased  approximately 23  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and decreased  approximately 05  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time based on the production activities of our licensees as well as general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

  

multimarket and other 

  

multimarket and other mmo consists of manufacturing services wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting legacy application specific integrated circuits complex programmable logic devices and aerospace products revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 28  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  approximately 12  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  and approximately 14  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  

net sales related to these services and products increased  approximately 700 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  and decreased  approximately 42 million  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  the increase in mmo net sales in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was driven primarily by our acquisition of atmel the decrease in mmo net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was driven primarily by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 55  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  approximately 53  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  and approximately 51  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2017  and approximately 12  of our net sales in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015  no single distributor accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2017  our distributors maintained 33  days of inventory of our products compared to 32  days at march 31 2016  and 37  days at march 31 2015  over the past five fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27  days and 37  days we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on when the distributor sells the product to their customer 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows dollars in thousands 



americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84  of our total net sales in each of fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 32  30  and 28  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increases in sales to customers in china including hong kong in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were due primarily to our continued focus on the chinese market as a key component to our global growth strategy and our acquisition of atmel which had a slightly higher percentage of its net sales from china including hong kong sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 9  12  and 14  of our net sales in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the decreases in sales to customers in taiwan in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were due primarily to our acquisitions of atmel and micrel which had lower percentages of their net sales from taiwan we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 17572 million  in fiscal 2017  12055 million  in fiscal 2016  and 12296 million  in fiscal 2015  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 516  in fiscal 2017  555  in fiscal 2016  and 573  in fiscal 2015  

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were 

  

 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

 

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity in fiscal 2017 our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities operated at normal capacity levels which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2015 in response to uncertain global economic conditions and our inventory position as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabs approximately 19 million and 08 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively we operated at slightly below normal capacity levels in our thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as a result we charged cost of sales approximately 10 million during fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2015 we operated at normal levels of capacity at our thailand assembly and test facilities 

  

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabrication facilities impact our gross margins our wafer fabrication facility located in tempe arizona fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 microns to 10 microns processes our wafer fabrication facility located in gresham oregon fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 013 microns to 05 microns processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs substantially all of our production in fab 2 and fab 4 has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90 to 95 as a result of our acquisition of atmel we acquired a 6inch wafer fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado fab 5 that currently utilizes processes between 025 microns and 10 microns we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70 to 75 as a result of our acquisition of micrel in august 2015 we acquired a 6inch wafer fabrication facility in san jose california and have since transitioned products previously manufactured at this facility to our fab 2 fab 4 and fab 5 facilities during the quarter ended december 31 2016 we decommissioned this san jose facility and subsequent to march 31 2017 we completed the sale of these assets for proceeds of 100 million as of march 31 2017 these assets consisting of property plant and equipment were presented as held for sale in our consolidated financial statements 

our overall inventory levels were 4172 million  at march 31 2017  compared to 3068 million at march 31 2016  and 2795 million at march 31 2015  the increases in inventory levels at march 31 2017 compared to march 31 2016 and the inventory levels at march 31 2016 compared to march 31 2015 were due primarily to the acquisitions of atmel and micrel we maintained 103 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2017  compared to 110 days of inventory at march 31 2016  and 111 days at march 31 2015  we expect our inventory levels in the june 2017  quarter to be between 97 days and 106 days we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface mixed signal and timing products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand and as a result of our acquisition of atmel we acquired a test facility in calamba philippines during fiscal 2017 approximately 36 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 53 during fiscal 2016 and approximately 57 during fiscal 2015 the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the 

semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities thirdparty contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations during fiscal 2017 approximately 60  of our test requirements were performed in our thailand and philippines facilities compared to approximately 81  of our test requirements performed in our thailand facilities during fiscal 2016 and approximately 88  during fiscal 2015 the primary reasons for the percentage reductions in the assembly and test operations performed internally in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 are our acquisitions of atmel and micrel which outsourced most of these activities over time we intend to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our thailand and philippines facilities we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements during fiscal 2017  approximately 41  of our total net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 39  during each of fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2017  were 5453 million  or 160  of sales compared to 3726 million  or 171  of sales for fiscal 2016  and 3495 million  or 163  of sales for fiscal 2015  we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 1727 million  or 463  for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to additional compensation and other costs from our acquisition of atmel rd as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to our restructuring activities and synergies realized following the acquisitions of atmel and micrel rd expenses increased 231 million  or 66  for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of micrel as well as higher headcount costs 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017  were 4998 million  or 147  of sales compared to 3017 million  or 139  of sales for fiscal 2016  and 2748 million  or 128  of sales for fiscal 2015  selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force cems and eses who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1981 million  or 657  for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  due primarily to additional costs from our acquisition of atmel selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to costs associated with accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards upon termination of certain atmel employees excluding these costs selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have been 139 of sales which is flat compared to fiscal 2016 selling general and administrative expenses increased 269 million  or 98  for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  due primarily to additional costs from our acquisition of micrel 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2017  was  3377 million  compared to  1749 million  in fiscal 2016  and  1767 million  in fiscal 2015  the primary reasons for the increase in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were increased amortization from our acquisitions of atmel and micrel partially offset by decreased amortization from our customerrelated intangible assets from our acquisitions of standard microsystems corporation smsc and issc technologies corporation issc the primary reasons for the decrease in acquired intangible asset amortization for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were decreased amortization from our customerrelated intangible assets from our acquisition of smsc partially offset by increased amortization from our acquisitions of micrel and issc 

special charges and other net 

  

during fiscal 2017 we incurred special charges and other net of 986 million  comprised primarily of restructuring charges our restructuring activities include workforce property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations in connection with these activities we incurred employee separation costs contract exit costs other operating expenses and intangible asset impairment losses the impairment losses were recognized as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition of atmel that affected the use and life of these assets during fiscal 2016 we incurred special charges and other net of  40 million  comprised of  112 million  restructuring charges associated with our acquisition activity and legal settlement costs of approximately  43 million  partially offset by special income and other net of  115 million  related to an insurance settlement for reimbursement of funds we previously paid to settle a lawsuit in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 during fiscal 2015 we incurred special charges and other net of 28 million related to severance office closing and other costs associated with our acquisition activity 

  

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2017  was 31 million  compared to 244 million  in fiscal 2016  and 195 million  in fiscal 2015  the primary reason for the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 relates to lower invested cash balances as we used cash to finance a significant portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of atmel the primary reason for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 relates to higher yields on shortterm cash investments and higher invested cash balances 

interest expense in fiscal 2017  was 1463 million  compared to 1040 million  in fiscal 2016  and 620 million in fiscal 2015  the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 relate to higher interest expense on amounts borrowed under our credit facility to partially finance our acquisition of atmel as well as the issuance of our 2017 senior and junior debt in february 2017 we paid off the remaining 16825 million balance on our credit facility the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 relate to the issuance of our 2015 senior debt partially offset by lower interest expense due to the settlement of 5750 million in principal of our 2007 junior debt in february 2015 

loss on settlement of convertible debt in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2015 was 439 million  and 506 million  respectively in february 2017 and 2015 we settled 4313 million and 5750 million respectively in principal of our 2007 junior debt in the case of the 2017 settlement the principal value of 4313 million was settled in cash and we issued shares of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount plus a cash inducement fee of 50 million in the case of the 2015 settlement the entire purchase price was settled in cash for 11346 million 

other loss net in fiscal 2017  was 13 million  compared to other income net of 89 million  in fiscal 2016  and other income net of 137 million  in fiscal 2015  the primary reason for the change in other income loss during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 relates to the lower realized gains on the sale of marketable equity and debt securities the primary reason for the change in other income loss during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 relates to lower realized gains on the sale of marketable equity and debt securities and losses resulting from derivative activity 

provision for income taxes 

  

our provision for income taxes reflects tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings we had an effective tax rate benefit of 900 in fiscal 2017 152 in fiscal 2016 and 56 in fiscal 2015 excluding certain tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the rd tax credit our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 includes 363 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and 79 million of expense related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization which reduces our effective tax rate by 403 and increased our effective tax 

rate by 88 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 includes a 129 million benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduces our effective tax rate by 143 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 also includes a 250 million benefit for sharebased compensation deductions which reduces our effective tax rate by 278 

our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 included 121 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and 155 million of benefits related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization which reduced our effective rate by 43 and 55 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 also included a 25 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit and a 135 million benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 09 and 48 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 included 331 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 96 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 also included a 18 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit which reduced our effective tax rate by 05 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns we are effectively subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2005 and later we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future any expiration of our tax holidays are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and an increase in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

results of discontinued operations 

discontinued operations represent the mobile touch operations that we acquired as part of our acquisition of atmel the mobile touch assets had been marketed for sale since our acquisition of atmel closed on april 4 2016 based on our managements decision that such business was not a strategic fit for our product portfolio on november 10 2016 we completed the sale of the mobile touch assets to solomon systech limited international a hong kong based semiconductor company the transaction included the sale of certain semiconductor products equipment customer list backlog and a license to certain other intellectual property and patents related to atmels mobile touch product line we also agreed to provide certain transition services to solomon systech which were substantially complete as of march 31 2017 for financial statement purposes the results of operations for this discontinued business have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended march 31 2017  was 60 million  and consists of a pretax loss from operations of 82 million and a pretax gain on sale of 06 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 14102 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2017  a   decrease  of 11544 million  from the march 31 2016  balance the decrease  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to 20362 million of cash and 9416 million from additional amounts borrowed under our credit facility for our acquisition of atmel net payments of 12440 million on amounts borrowed under our credit facility payments of 4362 million on the settlement of a portion of our 2007 junior debt and dividend payments of 3154 million partially offset primarily by proceeds from our new senior and junior debt issuances of 26450 million and cash generated by operating activities 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 10595 million  for fiscal 2017  7445 million  for fiscal 2016  and 7212 million  for fiscal 2015  the increase in net cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to operating cash flows resulting from our acquisitions of atmel and micrel and operating synergies realized from our process efficiency and restructuring efforts the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher net sales and an increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities 

net cash used in investing activities was 28380 million  for fiscal 2017  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 8004 million  for fiscal 2016  and net cash used in investing activities of 6783 million  in fiscal 2015  fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 investing cash flows include net cash and cash equivalents used to finance acquisitions of 27475 million  3620 million  and 6599 million  respectively excluding investing cash flows used for acquisitions net investing activities resulted in a use of cash of 905 million  in fiscal 2017 provided net cash flow of 11624 million  in fiscal 2016 and resulted in a use of cash of 184 million  in fiscal 2015 and represented primarily the net change in our investments capital purchases and sale of assets 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 753 million  in fiscal 2017  979 million  in fiscal 2016  and 1495 million  in fiscal 2015  capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 were relatively less than we have experienced in recent years as we delayed certain purchases until we had finalized and developed plans following the acquisition of atmel regarding process technology platforms and other manufacturing activities we currently intend to spend approximately 1700 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring inhouse more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 5955 million  for fiscal 2017  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 599 million  for fiscal 2016  and net cash provided by financing activities of 985 million  for fiscal 2015  we utilize our credit facility to fund operations pay dividends and finance acquisitions fiscal 2017 cash flows were favorably impacted by the net proceeds of debt issued that year significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include 

 

in february 2017 we amended our existing 27740 million credit agreement to among other things increase certain covenant compliance ratios the february 2017 amendment included a new collateral agreement that secures our borrowings with all assets of our guarantor subsidiaries with the exception of real property proceeds of loans made under the credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes at march 31 2017 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility compared to 10520 million  at march 31 2016  see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement 

our total cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was 9092 million at march 31 2017  and 25593 million at march 31 2016  the decrease is primarily due to cash used in our acquisition of atmel under current tax laws and regulations if accumulated earnings and profits held by our foreign subsidiaries that us taxes had not previously been provided for were to be distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments available for our us operations as of march 31 2017  and march 31 2016  was approximately 5010 million and 53 million respectively the increase is primarily due to net cash flow resulting from the issuances of the new senior and junior debt net of payments on amounts borrowed under our credit facility our us operations and capital requirements are funded primarily by cash generated from us operating activities which has been and is expected to be sufficient to meet our business needs in the us for the foreseeable future we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies including amounts borrowed under our credit agreement with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed should our us cash needs exceed funds generated by us operations for any reason including acquisitions of large capital assets or acquisitions of us businesses we may require additional funds in the us and would expect to borrow such additional funds under our existing credit facility pursue 

other us borrowing alternatives issue equity securities or utilize a combination of these sources we consider our offshore earnings to be permanently reinvested offshore however we could determine to repatriate some of our offshore earnings in future periods to fund stockholder dividends share repurchases acquisitions or other corporate activities we expect that a significant portion of our future cash generation will be in our foreign subsidiaries 

in february 2016 we terminated our tenyear fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements which were related to a portion of our fixedrate 1625 2015 senior subordinated convertible debt the interest rate swap agreements were designated as fair value hedges we paid variable interest equal to the threemonth libor minus 536 basis points and we received a fixed interest rate of 1625 upon termination the contracts were in an asset position resulting in cash receipts of approximately 257 million which included 37 million of accrued interest the cash flows from the termination of these interest rate swap agreements have been reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2017  we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

on april 4 2016 we completed our acquisition of atmel under the terms of the merger agreement executed on january 19 2016 atmel stockholders received 815 per share consisting of 700 per share in cash and 115 per share in shares of microchip common stock we financed the purchase price of our atmel acquisition using approximately 204 billion of cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries approximately 094 billion from additional amounts borrowed under our credit agreement and approximately 4861 million through the issuance of an aggregate of 101 million shares of our common stock the acquisition price represents a total equity value of approximately 347 billion and a total enterprise value of approximately 343 billion after excluding atmels cash and investments net of debt on its balance sheet of approximately 393 million the acquisition was structured in a manner that enabled us to utilize a substantial portion of the cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner although we believe our determinations with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition are reasonable we are regularly audited by the irs and may be audited by other taxing authorities and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such audit 

on august 3 2015 we acquired micrel for 1400 per share and paid an aggregate of approximately 4300 million in cash and issued an aggregate of 86   million   shares of our common stock to micrel shareholders we financed the cash portion of the purchase price with amounts borrowed under our credit agreement 

in may 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in january 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 150 million shares of common stock from the approximately 114 million shares remaining under the current authorization as of march 31 2016 we had repurchased 86 million shares under this authorization for approximately 3638 million there were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2017 there is no expiration date associated with this repurchase program 

as of march 31 2017  we held approximately 204 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 313 billion during fiscal 2017  we paid dividends in the amount of 1441  per share for a total dividend payment of 3154 million  during fiscal 2016  we paid dividends in the amount of 1433  per share for a total dividend payment of 2911 million  during fiscal 2015  we paid dividends in the amount of 1425  per share for a total dividend payment of 2865 million  on may 9 2017 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 03615 per share which will be paid on june 6 2017  to stockholders of record on may 23 2017  and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 830 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2017  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2017  dollars in thousands 



1 operating lease obligations include 330 million which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as of march 31 2017 this obligation is due under an operating lease from the acquisition of atmel for a building in san jose california 

2 capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property plant and equipment these obligations were not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of march 31 2017 as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 

3 other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and outstanding purchase commitments with our wafer foundries of approximately 983 million for delivery of wafers in fiscal 2018 

4 for purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 senior convertible debt will be paid on february 15 2027 which is the maturity date of such debt 

5 for purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our 2015 senior convertible debt will be paid on february 15 2025 which is the maturity date of such debt 

6 for purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our 2017 junior convertible debt will be paid on february 15 2037 which is the maturity date of such debt 

7 for purposes of this table we have assumed that the principal of our 2007 junior convertible debt will be paid on december 15 2037 which is the maturity date of such debt 

8 for purposes of this table pension obligations due in more than 5 years represent the expected pension payments from 2023 through 2027 it excludes pension obligations subsequent to 2027 

9 total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations as discussed below the contractual obligations also do not include amounts related to uncertain tax positions because reasonable estimates cannot be made 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of march 31 2017  we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk in the ordinary course of business we may provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us or our subsidiaries we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements based on historical experience and information currently available we believe we will not be required to make any payments under these guarantee arrangements

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

  

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit often with onboard nonvolatile program memory for program storage random access memory for data storage and various analog and digital inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software various analog mixedsignal timing and connectivity products and nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and flash memory 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the significant segments of the semiconductor market at over 15 billion in calendar year 2015 microcontrollers are primarily available in 8bit through 32bit architectures 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of highvolume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent a significant portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications the analog and mixedsignal segment of the semiconductor market is very large at over 44 billion in calendar year 2015 and this market is fragmented into a large number of sub segments

our family of development tools for our pic products range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation capability we also offer a complete suite of compilers software code configurators and simulators customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our pic development tools share the same integrated development environment 

  

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are approximately 200 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

  

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of development tools from microchip as well as our thirdparty development tool partners by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped approximately two million development tools 

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products 

  

our analog interface mixed signal and timing products consist of several families with over 3000 power management linear mixedsignal high voltage thermal management rf drivers safety and security timing usb ethernet wireless and other interface products 

  

we market and sell our analog interface mixed signal and timing products into our microcontroller customer base to customers who use microcontrollers from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

memory products 

our memory products consist of serial electrically erasable programmable readonly memory referred to as serial eeproms serial flash memories parallel flash memories and serial sram memories serial eeproms serial flash memories and serial srams have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small footprint devices we sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

  

technology licensing

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of companies that outsource all or substantial portions of their manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 microns to 50 microns during fiscal 2016 we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 022 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns during fiscal 2016 we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

as a result of our acquisition of micrel incorporated micrel in august 2015 we acquired a 6inch fab in san jose california and are in the process of providing last time inventory for our customers as we transition those products into our fab 2 and fab 4 facilities we intend to start decommissioning the san jose fab in late fiscal 2017 

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we have in recent years outsourced a larger portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities as a result of our acquisitions in recent years we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2016  approximately 39  of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

  

wafer probe assembly and test 

  

we perform wafer probe product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand we also perform a limited amount of wafer probe and test at our chandler arizona and san jose california facilities during fiscal 2016 we increased our thailand facilities capacity to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2016  approximately 53  of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facilities and approximately 81  of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable complementary metaloxide semiconductor cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

at the end of fiscal 2016  we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of  3739 million  and  2355 million  in other countries including  1828 million  in thailand at the end of fiscal 2015  we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of  3314 million  and  2502 million  in other countries including  1980 million  in thailand at the end of fiscal 2014  we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of  3119 million  and  2201 million  in other countries including  1791 million  in thailand 

we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers in such event we have plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of general purpose and specialized microcontrollers wired and wireless connectivity products analog interface mixed signal and timing products serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies development systems human interface products software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design assembly test and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2016  our rd expenses were  3726 million  compared to  3495 million  in fiscal 2015  and  3050 million  in fiscal 2014  rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of  320 million  in fiscal 2016   282 million  in fiscal 2015  and  246 million  in fiscal 2014  

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement managers cems embedded system engineers eses and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team eses also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

for information regarding revenue results of operations and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years refer to our financial statements included in this form 10k 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2016  we derived 53  of our net sales through distributors and 47  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2015  we derived 51  of our net sales through distributors and 49  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2014  we derived 53  of our net sales through distributors and 47  of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  or fiscal 2014  

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  were as follows dollars in thousands 



sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 30 28 and 29 of our net sales in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 12 14 and 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2016 fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 

our international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however in recent periods the impact of our acquisitions changes in global economic and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2016 our backlog was approximately 12123 million including approximately 3600 million related to atmel compared to 7650 million as of april 30 2015 which excludes atmel our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2016 and 2035 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided litigation which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the necessity of engaging in defensive litigation could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2016 we had 9766 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock adverse global economic conditions the subsequent economic recovery and uncertainty surrounding the strength and duration of such recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for our failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our 

operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity for example in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 we reduced wafer starts in both fab 2 and fab 4 which negatively impacted our gross profit through the march 2013 quarter we increased wafer starts modestly throughout fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 although we operated at normal capacity levels during the last three quarters of fiscal 2015 the first two quarters of fiscal 2016 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 there can be no assurance that such production levels will be maintained in future periods 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures including our recently completed acquisition of atmel 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses on april 4 2016 we acquired atmel which is our largest and most complex acquisition ever in addition in august 2015 we completed our acquisition of micrel in july 2014 we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in issc technologies corp issc in april 2014 we completed our acquisition of supertex inc supertex and in august 2012 we completed our acquisition of standard microsystems corporation smsc the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we may be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction in particular as a result of our atmel acquisition we became involved with certain thirdparty claims related to the atmel business see item 3 legal proceedings for information regarding such claims acquisitions may also result in charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional stockbased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our credit agreement raising debt issuing shares of our common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to assets or a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing obligations for preexisting liabilities related to the assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

in february 2015 we amended our credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility to 2555 billion and we sold 1725 billion of principal value of our 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures as a result of such transactions we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past in august 2015 we increased our borrowings under our credit agreement to finance the approximately 430 million cash portion of the purchase price of our micrel acquisition which closed on august 3 2015 in december 2015 we exercised our increase option in our credit agreement to obtain additional revolving commitments of 219 million bringing our total revolving credit facility to 2774 billion at march 31 2016 we had 10520 million in outstanding borrowings under such credit agreement in connection with the closing of our acquisition of atmel on april 4 2016 we increased our borrowings under our credit agreement by approximately 094 billion to finance a portion of the purchase price of such acquisition our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our loans under our credit agreement our 

debentures or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility to future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products have declined over time 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog interface mixed signal and timing products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 approximately 39 of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries we also use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of smsc in august 2012 supertex in april 2014 and issc in july 2014 the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner on terms favorable to us or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that we desire to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further our use of subcontractors increases the risks of potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality as a result in periods when these broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and approximately 51 of our net sales in fiscal 2015 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technologies and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the 

relationships that we have with our suppliers this could impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights product failures contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from third parties from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against us our direct or indirect customers or our licensees these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement provide a costeffective remedy or successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries economic damage or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace defense safety security and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in 

uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2016 approximately 84 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 30 in china during fiscal 2015 approximately 84 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 28 in china 

a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition or economic weakness in the china market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china in particular economic conditions in china remain uncertain and we are unable to predict whether such uncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods 

we deliver products to our european customers through our facilities in england the uk’s eu referendum on june 23 2016 called brexit in the press is to determine whether the uk will leave the eu if the uk does leave the eu we may lose our ability to import and export products taxfree throughout europe as a result it may increase the costs to microchip for the import and sale of our products to our customers which may result in a decrease in sales to certain of our customers in order to avoid these costs we may have to consider alternate methods for delivering product into europe in implementing these changes we may experience a disruption in operations or product shipments 

we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we use various foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers but where we do certain terms of such contracts expose us to risks and liabilities 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had approximately 93000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 10 of our total revenue for fiscal 2016 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale further as a result of our acquisitions we may inherit certain customer contracts that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we are not able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have been and may in the future be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement product failure or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline as our licenses are based on per unit royalties 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results    

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected over the past several months the us dollar has declined slightly against the euro and other major currencies although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by such change in the value of the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that the strength of the dollar will have on our business or results of operations 

interruptions in our information technology systems or improper handling of data could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by any such disruptions or security breaches additionally any failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations litigation fines and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems however such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us were future attacks successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus measures patches log monitors routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password modifications there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attacks or disruptions any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of our internal systems defending litigation responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects employment risks environmental matters political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with many federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in the quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products energy efficiency measures and supplier practices associated with sourcing and manufacturing these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than existing legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices or may charge us more for complying with them the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside of the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in recent years there have been a number of initiatives proposed by the obama administration and members of congress regarding the tax treatment of such undistributed earnings if adopted certain of these initiatives would substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the us changes in tax law such as these proposals could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

customer demands and new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on june 1 2015 other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that we are using conflictfree minerals customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited if we make changes to materials or suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are conflictfree we have incurred and 

expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free in a materially different manner than advocated by the conflict free smelter initiative or the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear international traffic in arms regulations itar and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with these or other export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2011 and later we are currently under irs audit for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2008 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

as a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly in recent years and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

when we acquire a business a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired as of march 31 2016 we had goodwill of 10127 million and net intangible assets of 6063 million we review our longlived assets including goodwill 

and other intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill or material longlived asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015 however if in future periods we determine that our longlived assets including goodwill or intangible assets are impaired we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409  revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which will supersede nearly all existing revenue guidance under us gaap the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and have not elected a transition method refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new guidance and its potential impact on us 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business 

climate change regulations could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages and higher costs of water or energy to control the temperature of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as arizona and thailand some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant consequently we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are generally not determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations however if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any of the legal proceedings described below or in other legal proceedings that were not deemed material to us as of the date hereof then such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are from time to time subject to such litigation as a result no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

as a result of our acquisition of atmel which closed april 4 2016 we became involved with the following lawsuits 

in re continental airbag products liability litigation  on may 11 2016 an amended and consolidated class action complaint complaint was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida miami division against atmel continental automotive systems inc honda motor co ltd and an affiliate and daimler ag and an affiliate 

the complaint which includes claims arising under federal law and florida california new jersey michigan and louisiana state lawalleges that class members unknowingly purchased or leased vehicles containing defective airbag control units allegedly incorporating defective application specific integrated circuits manufactured by atmel between 2006 and 2010 and thereby suffered financial harm including a loss in the value of their purchased or leased vehicles the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory and exemplary damages statutory penalties pre and postjudgment interest attorneys fees and injunctive and other relief atmel intends to contest plaintiffs claims vigorously 

southern district of new york action by lfoundry rousset lfr and lfr employees  on march 4 2014 lfr and jeanyves guerrini individually and on behalf of a putative class of lfr employees filed an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the district court against atmel its french subsidiary atmel rousset sas atmel rousset and lfoundry gmbh lf lfrs german parent the case purports to relate to atmel roussets june 2010 sale of its wafer manufacturing facility in rousset france to lf and lfrs subsequent insolvency and later liquidation more than three years later the district court dismissed the case on august 21 2015 and plaintiffs are appealing the dismissal 

individual labor actions by former lfr employees  in the wake of lfrs insolvency and liquidation over 500 former employees of lfr have filed individual labor actions against atmel rousset in a french labor court atmel rousset believes that each of these actions is entirely devoid of merit and further that any assertion by any of the claimants of a coemployment relationship with atmel rousset is based substantially on the same specious arguments that the paris commercial court summarily rejected in 2014 in related proceedings atmel rousset therefore intends to defend vigorously against each of these claims

note regarding forwardlooking statements 

  

this report including item 1 – business item 1a – risk factors and item 7 – managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our strategy financial performance and revenue sources we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect estimate future continue intend and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements include without limitation statements regarding the following 



 

our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in item 1a – risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10k although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we disclaim any obligation to update the information contained in any forwardlooking statement 

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 –  business item 6 –  selected financial data and item 8 –  financial statements and supplementary data 

  

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 36 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the sections titled liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including general purpose and specialized microcontrollers development tools and related software analog interface mixed signal and timing products wired and wireless connectivity products memory products and technology licensing we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power usage wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development thus enabling timely and costeffective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products we license our superflash technology and other technologies to wafer foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of advanced microcontroller products gate array rf and analog products that require embedded nonvolatile memory 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory analog and mixedsignal products flaship systems development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our client engagement manager cems embedded system engineer eses and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our ese team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for cems and distributor sales teams eses also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

see our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry on page 15 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these 

estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to original equipment manufacturers oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

  

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2016  we had approximately 2672 million of deferred revenue and 838 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1834 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2015  we had approximately 2609 million of deferred revenue and 948 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1661 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 1029 million at march 31 2016  and 1160 million at march 31 2015  on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process 

discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

  

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

  

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets and acquired investments in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments acquired also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activity by the investees the investees capital structure and the terms of the investees issued interests under the acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2016  we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2016 was 714 million of which 631 million was reflected in operating expenses total sharebased compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal 2016 was 83 million total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 62 million at march 31 2016 

  

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans option pricing models including the blackscholes model require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is most reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts we estimate the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the impact on prior period amortization for all 

unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2016  was immaterial 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

  

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of production below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 19 million 08 million and 190 million was charged directly to cost of sales in fiscal 2016  fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and state tax credits where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized at march 31 2016 the valuation allowances totaled 1618 million should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2016 our deferred tax asset net of valuation allowances was 1222   million 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under irs audit for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share which were  6605  and  2431  for the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures respectively at march 31 2016  and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are not generally determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

  

our net sales of  21733 million  in fiscal 2016   increased  by  263 million  or 12  over fiscal 2015  and our net sales of  21470 million  in fiscal 2015   increased  by  2158 million  or 112  from fiscal 2014  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2016  over fiscal 2015  was due primarily to our acquisition of micrel offset in part by weaker general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  was due primarily to our acquisitions of issc and supertex market share gains and improved general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve average selling prices for our semiconductor products were down approximately 3 in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015 and were up approximately 2 in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was up approximately 6 in fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015 and up approximately 11 in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows dollars in thousands 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 619  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  approximately 649  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 653  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  

  

net sales of our microcontroller products decreased  approximately 35  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  and increased  approximately 105  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  the decrease  in net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  resulted primarily from weaker general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve including the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  resulted primarily from our acquisition of issc in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 market share gains and improved general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products 

  

sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products accounted for approximately 274  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  approximately 233  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 222  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  

  

net sales of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products increased  approximately 188  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  and increased  approximately 170  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  the increase  in net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was driven primarily by our acquisition of micrel in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and market share gains achieved within the analog interface mixed signal and timing market the increase in net sales in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was driven primarily by our acquisition of supertex in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 improved general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains achieved within the analog interface mixed signal and timing market 

  

analog interface mixed signal and timing products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than a majority of our analog interface mixed signal and timing product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface mixed signal and timing products will increase over time 

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 54  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  approximately 62  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 70  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  

  

net sales of our memory products decreased  approximately 116  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  and decreased  approximately 18  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  the decreases in memory product net sales in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  and in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  were driven primarily by adverse customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets 

  

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 41  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  approximately 42  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 49  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  

net sales related to our technology licensing decreased  approximately 05  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  and decreased  approximately 53  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time based on the production activities of our licensees as well as general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

  

other 

  

revenue from wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting services accounted for approximately 12  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  approximately 14  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 06  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 53  of our net sales in fiscal 2016  approximately 51  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 53  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  

  

our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 12  of our net sales in each of fiscal 2016  and 2015  and approximately 14  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  no single distributor accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2016  our distributors maintained 32  days of inventory of our products compared to 37  days at march 31 2015  and 33  days at march 31 2014  over the past five fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27  days and 47  days we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

  

net sales by geography 

  

net sales by geography for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows dollars in thousands 



our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 30 28 and 29 of our net sales in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 12 14 and 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 12055 million in fiscal 2016  12296 million in fiscal 2015  and 11287 million in fiscal 2014  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 555 in fiscal 2016  573 in fiscal 2015  and 584 in fiscal 2014  

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were 

  

 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

 

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and all of fiscal 2014 in response to uncertain global economic conditions and our inventory position as a result of production being below normal operating levels in our wafer fabs approximately 19 million 08 million and 190 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2016 fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively our wafer fabrication facilities operated at normal capacity levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 in the future if production levels are below normal capacity we will charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity we operated at slightly below normal capacity levels in our thailand assembly and test facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as a result we charged cost of sales approximately 

10 million during fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 we operated at normal levels of capacity at our thailand assembly and test facilities and we selectively increased our assembly and test capacity at such facilities during such time 

  

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 micron to 10 micron processes fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 022 micron to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs substantially all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

our overall inventory levels were 3068 million at march 31 2016  compared to 2795 million at march 31 2015  and 2627 million at march 31 2014  we maintained 110 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2016  compared to 111 days of inventory at march 31 2015  and 118 days at march 31 2014  we expect our inventory levels in the june 2016  quarter to increase from 1 to 9 days from the march 2016  levels not including the impact from inventory acquired from our atmel acquisition we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface mixed signal and timing products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

during fiscal 2016  approximately 53  of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 57  during fiscal 2015  and approximately 51  during fiscal 2014  the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations during fiscal 2016  approximately 81  of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 88  during fiscal 2015  and approximately 86  during fiscal 2014  the primary reason for the percentage reduction in the assembly and test operations performed in our thailand facilities in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior periods is our acquisition of micrel which outsourced these activities over time we intend to migrate a portion of the outsourced assembly and test activities to our thailand facilities we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements during each of fiscal 2016  and 2015  approximately 39  of our total net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 38  during fiscal 2014  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2016  were 3726 million or 171 of sales compared to 3495 million or 163 of sales for fiscal 2015  and 3050 million or 158 of sales for fiscal 2014  we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 231 million or 66 for fiscal 2016  over fiscal 2015  primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of micrel as well as higher headcount costs rd expenses increased 445 million or 146 for fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  the primary reasons for the increase in rd costs in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  were additional costs from our acquisitions of supertex and issc as well as higher headcount costs 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016  were 3017 million or 139 of sales compared to 2748 million or 128 of sales for fiscal 2015  and 2673 million or 138 of sales for fiscal 2014  selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 269 million or 98 for fiscal 2016  over fiscal 2015  due primarily to additional costs from our acquisition of micrel selling general and administrative expenses increased 75 million or 28 for fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  the primary reasons for the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  were additional costs from our acquisitions of supertex and issc and higher headcount costs partially offset by lower legal expenses

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2016  was 244 million compared to 195 million in fiscal 2015  and 165 million in fiscal 2014  the primary reasons for the increases in interest income over these periods relates to higher yields on shortterm cash investments and higher invested cash balances 

interest expense in fiscal 2016  was 1040 million compared to 620 million in fiscal 2015  and 487 million in fiscal 2014  the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 relates to noncash interest expense from the amortization on the debt discount of our 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures and interest expense related to the 1625 coupon on such debentures which were issued in february 2015 the increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense on our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures as a result of our purchase of 50 of such outstanding debentures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 relates to noncash interest expense from the amortization on the debt discount of our 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures which were issued in february 2015 and in increase in interest expense from our credit line borrowings 

loss on retirement of convertible debentures in fiscal 2015 was 506 million in february 2015 we acquired certain of our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures with a 5750 million aggregate principal amount for an aggregate purchase price of 11346 million based on market value the transaction resulted in a loss on retirement of convertible debentures of approximately 506 million which represented the difference between the fair value of the liability component at time of repurchase and the sum of the carrying values of the debt component and any unamortized debt issuance costs 

other income net in fiscal 2016  was 89 million compared to other income net of 137 million in fiscal 2015  and other income net of 59 million in fiscal 2014  the primary reason for the change in other income net during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 relates to lower realized gains on the sale of marketable equity and debt securities and losses resulting from derivative activity the primary reasons for the change in other income net during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 relates to realized gains of 185 million from the sale of marketable equity and debt securities and fluctuations on our foreign currency derivatives 

provision for income taxes 

  

our provision for income taxes reflects tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings we had an effective tax rate benefit of 152 in fiscal 2016 and 56 in fiscal 2015 and an effective tax rate of 86 in fiscal 2014 excluding certain tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the rd tax credit our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 includes 121 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and 155 million of benefits related to intercompany prepaid tax amortization which reduced our effective rate by 43 and 55 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 also includes a 25 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit and a 135 million benefit received from current year generated rd credits which reduced our effective tax rate by 09 and 48 respectively our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 included 331 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 96 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 also included a 18 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit which reduced our effective tax rate by 05 during fiscal 2014 our effective tax rate included 194 million of benefits related to various items including a settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves these benefits reduced our effective tax rate by 45 to an effective tax rate of 86 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2011 and later tax returns remain open for examination by the taxing authorities we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future any expiration of our tax holidays are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and an increase in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 25646 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2016  an increase of 2224 million from the march 31 2015  balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities and increases in borrowings under our credit facility offset in part by our dividend payments of 2911 million and 3439 million of cash net of cash acquired used for our acquisition of micrel 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 7445 million for fiscal 2016  7212 million for fiscal 2015  and 6766 million for fiscal 2014  the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher net sales and an increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher net sales during fiscal 2015 

  

net cash provided by investing activities was 8004 million for fiscal 2016  net cash used in investing activities was 6783 million for fiscal 2015  and 5033 million in fiscal 2014  the primary reason for the increase in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was an increase in cash from our sales and maturities of availableforsale investments of 11126 million offset in part by 3439 million of cash consideration net of 992 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired used to finance our acquisition of micrel in august 2015 the increase in net cash used in investing 

activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was due primarily to 2525 million of cash consideration net of 151 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired used to finance our acquisition of issc in july 2014 and 3754 million of cash consideration net of 148 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired used to finance our acquisition of supertex in april 2014 offset in part by an increase in cash from our purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale investments in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 979 million in fiscal 2016  1495 million in fiscal 2015  and 1131 million in fiscal 2014  capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 140 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase our capacity 

  

we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

net cash used in financing activities was 599 million for fiscal 2016  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 985   million for fiscal 2015  and net cash used in financing activities of 2350 million for fiscal 2014  we made payments on our borrowings under our credit agreements of 16145 million during fiscal 2016  20476 million during fiscal 2015  and 11035 million during fiscal 2014  cash received on borrowings under our credit agreement totaled 22045 million during fiscal 2016  18596 million during fiscal 2015  and 11335 million during fiscal 2014  in february 2015 we issued 17250 million principal amount of 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures due february 15 2025 the debentures are subordinated to our senior debt including amounts borrowed under our amended credit facility but are senior to our outstanding 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures also in february 2015 we acquired certain of our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures with a 5750 million aggregate principal amount for an aggregate purchase price of 11346 million based on market value cash expended for the repurchase of shares of our common stock was 3638 million in fiscal 2016 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of 2911 million in fiscal 2016  2865 million in fiscal 2015  and 2812 million in fiscal 2014  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were 287 million for fiscal 2016  344 million for fiscal 2015  and 601 million for fiscal 2014  

in february 2015 we amended our 20 billion credit agreement with certain lenders as a result of such amendment the revolving credit facility portion of the agreement was increased from 16500 million to 25550 million and the 3500 million term loan portion of the agreement was removed the increase option permitting us subject to certain requirements to arrange with existing lenders or new lenders to provide up to an aggregate of 3000 million in additional commitments was also adjusted to 2494 million in december 2015 we exercised our increase option in our credit agreement to obtain additional revolving commitments of 2190 million bringing our total revolving credit facility commitments to 27740 million proceeds of loans made under the credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes at march 31 2016 10520 million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement 

our total cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was 25593 million at march 31 2016  and 23224 million at march 31 2015  under current tax laws and regulations if accumulated earnings and profits held by our foreign subsidiaries that us taxes had not previously been provided for were to be distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments available for our us operations as of march 31 2016  and march 31 2015  was approximately 53 million and 198 million respectively we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies including borrowings under our credit agreement with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed we consider our offshore earnings to be permanently reinvested offshore however we could determine to repatriate some of our offshore earnings in future periods to fund stockholder dividends share repurchases acquisitions or other corporate activities we expect that a significant portion of our future cash generation will be in our foreign subsidiaries 

in march 2015 we entered into tenyear fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements on a portion of our fixedrate 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures the interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges we paid variable interest equal to the threemonth libor minus 536 basis points and we received a fixed interest rate of 1625 the gross notional amount of these contracts outstanding at march 31 2015 was 4313 million in february 2016 the company terminated its interest rate swap agreements upon termination the contracts were in an asset position resulting in cash receipts of approximately 257 million which included 37 million of accrued interest the cash flows from the 

termination of these interest rate swap agreements have been reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2016  we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

on august 3 2015 we acquired micrel for 1400 per share and paid an aggregate of approximately 4300 million in cash and issued an aggregate of 86   million   shares of our common stock to micrel shareholders we financed the cash portion of the purchase price with borrowings under our existing credit agreement 

on april 4 2016 we completed our acquisition atmel under the terms of the merger agreement executed on january 19 2016 atmel stockholders received 815 per share in a combination of 700 per share in cash and 115 per share in shares of microchip common stock we financed the purchase price of our atmel acquisition using approximately 204 billion of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries approximately 094 billion from additional borrowings under our existing line of credit agreement and approximately 489 million through the issuance of an aggregate of 101 million shares of our common stock the acquisition price represents a total equity value of approximately 347 billion and a total enterprise value of approximately 343 billion after excluding atmels cash and investments net of debt of approximately 393 million the acquisition was structured in a manner that enabled us to utilize a substantial portion of the cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner although we believe our determinations with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition are reasonable we are regularly audited by the irs and may be audited by other taxing authorities and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such audit 

in may 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2016 we had repurchased 86 million shares under this authorization for approximately 3638 million in january 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 150 million shares of common stock from the approximately 114 million shares remaining under the current authorization there is no expiration date associated with this repurchase program 

as of march 31 2016  we held approximately 233 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 281 billion during fiscal 2016  we paid dividends in the amount of 1433 per share for a total dividend payment of 2911 million during fiscal 2015  we paid dividends in the amount of 1425 per share for a total dividend payment of 2865 million during fiscal 2014  we paid dividends in the amount of 1417 per share for a total dividend payment of 2812 million on may 4 2016 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 03595 per share which will be paid on june 6 2016  to stockholders of record on may 23 2016  and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 77 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2016  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2016  dollars in thousands 















purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

  

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit often with onboard nonvolatile program memory for program storage random access memory for data storage and various analog and digital inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software various analog mixedsignal and connectivity products and nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and flash memory 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the significant segments of the semiconductor market at approximately 15 billion in calendar year 2014 microcontrollers are primarily available in 8bit through 32bit architectures 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of highvolume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent a significant portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications the analog and mixedsignal segment of the semiconductor market is very large at over 44 billion in calendar year 2014 and this market is fragmented into a large number of sub segments

our analog interface and mixed signal products consist of several families with over 1500 power management linear mixedsignal high voltage thermal management rf drivers safety and security usb ethernet wireless and other interface products 

  

we market and sell our analog interface and mixed signal products into our microcontroller customer base to customers who use microcontrollers from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

memory products 

our memory products consist of serial electrically erasable programmable readonly memory referred to as serial eeproms serial flash memories parallel flash memories and serial sram memories serial eeproms serial flash memories and serial sram have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small footprint devices we sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

  

technology licensing 

  

our technology licensing business includes license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of our superflash ®  embedded flash and smartbits ®  one time programmable nvm technologies we also generate fees for engineering services related to these technologies we license our nvm technologies to foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products gate array rf and analog products that require embedded nonvolatile memory 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of companies that outsource all or substantial portions of their manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 microns to 50 microns during fiscal 2015 we increased fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 022 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns during fiscal 2015 we increased fab 4s capacity to support more advanced technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment a significant amount of additional clean room capacity in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

as a result of our acquisition of supertex inc we acquired a 6inch fab in san jose california which was shut down in the march 2015 quarter and is in the process of being decommissioned 

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we have in recent years outsourced a larger portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities as a result of our recent acquisitions we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2015 approximately 39 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

  

wafer probe assembly and test 

  

we perform wafer probe product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand we also perform a limited amount of wafer probe at our chandler arizona facility during fiscal 2015 we increased our thailand facilities capacity to support more technologies by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment during fiscal 2015 approximately 57 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facilities and approximately 88 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements as a result of our acquisition of supertex we acquired a test facility in hong kong which was shut down in the march 2015 quarter 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

at the end of fiscal 2015 we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3314 million and 2502 million in other countries including 1980 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2014 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3119 million and 2201 million in other countries including 1791 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2013 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3253 million and 1892 million in other countries including 1711 million in thailand 

we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers in such event we have plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of general purpose and specialized microcontrollers serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies connectivity products analog interface and mixed signal products development systems user interface products software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design assembly test and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2015 our rd expenses were 3495   million compared to 3050   million in fiscal 2014 and 2547 million in fiscal 2013 rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of 282 million in fiscal 2015 246 million in fiscal 2014 and 222 million in fiscal 2013 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2015 we derived 51 of our net sales through distributors and 49 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we derived 53 of our net sales through distributors and 47 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were as follows dollars in thousands 



sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014 and approximately 83 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 28 of our net sales in fiscal 2015 approximately 29 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 and approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and approximately 13 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 

our international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however in recent periods changes in global economic and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2015 our backlog was approximately 7650 million compared to 8131 million as of april 30 2014 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2015 and 2034 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while our intention is to continue to patent our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products as with any operating company the scope and strength of our intellectual property assets including our pending and existing patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage moreover pursuing violations of intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex challenge involving multinational patent trademark copyright and trade secret law further the laws of particular foreign countries often fail to protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have also entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies and those licenses relate to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers from time to time receive and may continue to receive demand letters from third parties asserting infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights we diligently investigate all such notices and respond as we believe appropriate in most cases we believe that we can obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms however we cannot be certain that this would be the case or that litigation or damages for any past infringement could be avoided litigation which could result in substantial costs and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the necessity of engaging in defensive litigation could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2015 we had 9449 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 11 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock adverse global economic conditions the subsequent economic recovery and uncertainty surrounding the strength and duration of such recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for our failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity for example in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we reduced wafer starts in both fab 2 and fab 4 to help control inventory balances in response to a slowdown in global economic conditions we continued with the reduced level of wafer starts through the first quarter of fiscal 2013 these actions had a negative impact on our gross profit we further reduced the wafer starts in our fabs in late september 2012 and again during the quarter ended december 31 2012 which continued to negatively impact our gross profit through the march 2013 quarter we increased wafer starts modestly throughout fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 although we operated at normal capacity levels during the last three quarters of fiscal 2015 there can be no assurance that such production levels will be maintained in future periods 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility to future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface and mixed signal products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface and mixed signal products have declined over time 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog interface and mixed signal products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash and other technologies also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs specifically during fiscal 2015 approximately 39 of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries we also use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisitions of smsc in august 2012 supertex in april 2014 and issc in july 2014 the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if the countries in which such contractors are located were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner on terms favorable to us or at all additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that we desire to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further our use of subcontractors increases opportunities for potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash and other technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from outside wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions and our acquisition activity can have a more significant impact on our results than seasonality as a result in periods when these broad fluctuations changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur it is difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the semiconductor industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 51 of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and approximately 53 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash and other technologies the success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance of these technologies and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technologies and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our licensed technologies are complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses in this regard in july 2014 we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest of issc in april 2014 we completed our acquisition of supertex and in august 2012 we completed our acquisition of smsc in may 2015 we announced an agreement to acquire micrel incorporated the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we may be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional stockbased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our credit agreement raising debt issuing shares of common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to divest assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to assets or a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors landlords or other third parties we may also have continuing obligations for preexisting liabilities related to the assets or businesses such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the relationships that we have with our suppliers this could impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers or licensees from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against us our customers or our licensees by third parties these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell our expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2015 approximately 84 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 28 in china during fiscal 2014 approximately 84 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 29 in china a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition or economic weakness in the china market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding or political instability in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we use various foundries and other foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers but where we do certain terms of such contracts expose us to risks and liabilities 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had approximately 91000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 10 of our total revenue for fiscal 2015 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale further as a result of our acquisitions we may inherit certain customer contracts that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to limit the number of contracts that we sign which contain such special provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we are not able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have been and may in the future be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years while our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally as described above operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline as our licenses are based on per unit royalties 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results    

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar such as recent declines in the euro relative to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected over the past several months the us dollar has appreciated significantly against the euro and other major currencies although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by such strength in the us dollar there can be no assurance as to the future impact that a strong dollar will have on our business or results of operations 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by any such disruptions or security breaches additionally failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations litigation fines and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems however such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us were future attacks successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus measures patches log monitors routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password modifications there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attack or disruptions any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of internal systems defending litigation responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects employment risks political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with many federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products and energy efficiency measures these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than existing legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices or may charge us more for complying with them the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in recent years there have been a number of initiatives proposed by the obama administration and members of congress regarding the tax treatment of such undistributed earnings if adopted certain of these initiatives would substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the us changes in tax law such as these proposals could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

customer demands and new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released investigation disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and which are necessary to the functionality or production of products we filed a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters on june 2 2014 and are required to file annually thereafter other countries are considering similar regulations if we cannot certify that we are using conflictfree minerals customers may demand that we change the sourcing of minerals and other materials used in the manufacture of our products even if the costs for compliant minerals and materials significantly increases and availability is limited if we make changes to materials andor suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to certify that our products are conflictfree we have incurred and expect in the future to incur additional costs associated with complying 

with these new disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with these or other export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2011 and later we are currently under irs audit for fiscal 2011 and 2012 we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2007 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill or material longlived asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

in february 2015 we amended our credit agreement to increase the revolving credit facility to 2555 billion and remove the term loan at march 31 2015 we had 4620 million in outstanding borrowings under such credit agreement also in february 2015 we sold 1725 billion of principal value of our 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures as a result of such transactions we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our loans under our credit agreement our debentures or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business 

climate change regulations could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages and higher costs of water or energy to control the temperature of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as arizona and thailand some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory analog and mixedsignal products flaship systems development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

see our operating results are impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuation of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry on page 14 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these 

estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to original equipment manufacturers oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

  

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2015 we had approximately 2609 million of deferred revenue and 948 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1661 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2014 we 

had approximately 2228 million of deferred revenue and 750 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1478 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 1160 million at march 31 2015 and 928 million at march 31 2014 on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process 

discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

  

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

  

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets and acquired investments in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments acquired also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activity by the investees the investees capital structure and the terms of the investees issued interests under the acquisition method of accounting the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill on an annual basis we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31 2015  we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill balance 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2015 was 586 million of which 496 million was reflected in operating expenses total sharebased compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 was 90 million total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 41 million at march 31 2015 

  

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans option pricing models including the blackscholes model require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is most reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts we estimate the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the impact on prior period amortization for all 

unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2015 was immaterial 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

  

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of production below normal operating levels in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 08 million 190 million and 317 million was charged directly to cost of sales in fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and state tax credits where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized at march 31 2015 the valuation allowances totaled 819 million should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2015 our deferred tax asset net of valuation allowances was 2768   million 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under irs audit for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share which were 6817 and  2509  for the senior and junior subordinated convertible debentures respectively at march 31 2015  and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are not generally determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

  

our net sales of 21470   million in fiscal 2015 increased by 2158 million or 112 over fiscal 2014 and our net sales of 19312 million in fiscal 2014 increased by 3496 million or 221 from fiscal 2013 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 was due primarily to our acquisitions of issc and supertex market share gains and improved general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 was due primarily to general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 was also impacted by our acquisition of smsc on august 2 2012 average selling prices for our semiconductor products were up approximately 2 in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 and were up approximately 4 in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was up approximately 11 in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 and up approximately 17 in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were as follows dollars in thousands 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 649  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  approximately 653  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  and approximately 655  of our net sales in fiscal 2013  

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 105 in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  and increased approximately 218 in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  the increase in net sales in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  resulted primarily from our acquisition of issc in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 market share gains and improved general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve including the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  resulted primarily from our acquisition of smsc in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 market share gains and general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products 

  

sales of our analog interface and mixed signal products accounted for approximately 233  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  approximately 222  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  and approximately 194  of our net sales in fiscal 2013  

  

net sales of our analog interface and mixed signal products increased approximately 170 in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  and increased approximately 391 in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  the increase in net sales in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was driven primarily by our acquisition of supertex in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 improved general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains achieved within the analog interface and mixed signal market the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains achieved within the analog interface and mixed signal market 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than 80 of our analog interface and mixed signal product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface and mixed signal business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface and mixed signal products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface and mixed signal products will increase over time 

  

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 62  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  approximately 70  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  and approximately 90  of our net sales in fiscal 2013  

  

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 18 in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  and decreased approximately 56 in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  the decreases in memory product net sales in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  and in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  were driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets 

  

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 42  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  approximately 49  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  and approximately 53  of our net sales in fiscal 2013  

net sales related to our technology licensing decreased approximately 53 in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  and increased approximately 129 in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time based on the production activities of our licensees as well as general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

  

other 

  

revenue from wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting services accounted for approximately 14  of our net sales in fiscal 2015  approximately 06  of our net sales in fiscal 2014  and approximately 08  of our net sales in fiscal 2013  

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 51 of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 53 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  

  

our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2015  approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2014  and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2013  no single distributor accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  or fiscal 2013  

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2015  our distributors maintained 37 days of inventory of our products compared to 33 days at march 31 2014  and 30 days at march 31 2013  over the past five fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

  

net sales by geography 

  

net sales by geography for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows dollars in thousands 



our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  and approximately 83 of our net sales in fiscal 2013  substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 28 of our net sales in fiscal 2015  approximately 29 of our net sales in fiscal 2014  and approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2013  sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2015  and approximately 13 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 12296 million in fiscal 2015  11287 million in fiscal 2014  and 8385 million in fiscal 2013  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 573 in fiscal 2015  584 in fiscal 2014  and 530 in fiscal 2013  

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were 

  

 37 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

 

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 in response to uncertain global economic conditions and our inventory position as a result of production below normal operating levels in our wafer fabs approximately 08 million 190 million and 317 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 respectively our wafer fabrication facilities have been operating at normal capacity levels since the first quarter of fiscal 2015 in the future if production levels are below normal capacity we will charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 we operated at normal levels of capacity at our thailand assembly and test facilities and we selectively increased our assembly and test capacity at such facilities during such time during fiscal 2013 we operated below the normal capacity levels of our thailand assembly and test facilities due to adverse business conditions and these actions had a negative impact on our gross margins during such periods 

  

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 micron to 10 micron processes fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 022 micron to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs substantially all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

our overall inventory levels were 2795 million at march 31 2015  compared to 2627 million at march 31 2014  and 2423 million at march 31 2013  we maintained 111 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2015  compared to 118 days of inventory at march 31 2014  and 116 days at march 31 2013  we expect our inventory levels in the june 2015  quarter to increase between 3 and 9 days from the march 2015  levels we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface and mixed signal products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

during fiscal 2015  approximately 57 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 51 during fiscal 2014  and approximately 60 during fiscal 2013  the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations during fiscal 2015  approximately 88 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 86 during fiscal 2014  and approximately 87 during fiscal 2013  we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements during fiscal 2015  approximately 39 of our total net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 38 during fiscal 2014  and approximately 33 during fiscal 2013  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2015 were 3495 million or 163 of sales compared to 3050 million or 158 of sales for fiscal 2014 and 2547 million or 161 of sales for fiscal 2013 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 445 million or 146 for fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were additional costs from our acquisitions of supertex and issc as well as higher headcount costs and bonus costs rd expenses increased 503 million or 198 for fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc as well as higher headcount costs and bonus costs 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 were 2748 million or 128 of sales compared to 2673 million or 138 of sales for fiscal 2014 and 2615 million or 165 of sales for fiscal 2013 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 75 million or 28 for fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 were additional costs from our acquisitions of supertex and issc and higher headcount costs partially offset by lower legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 58 million or 22 for fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 were higher headcount costs related to our acquisition of smsc and higher bonus costs partially offset by lower acquisition related legal expenses professional services and sharebased compensation 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

special charges 

  

during fiscal 2015 we incurred special charges of 28 million related to severance office closing and other costs associated with our acquisition activity during fiscal 2014 we incurred special charges of 30 million related to severance office closing and other costs associated with our acquisition activity during fiscal 2013 we incurred special charges of 322 million comprised of a 44 million net increase in the fair value of contingent consideration related to one of our acquisitions 163 million of primarily severancerelated costs in addition to office closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of smsc and legal settlement costs of approximately 115 million for certain legal matters related to an entity which we acquired in april 2010 in excess of previously accrued amounts 

  

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2015 was 195 million compared to 165 million in fiscal 2014 and 156 million in fiscal 2013 the primary reasons for the increases in interest income over these periods relates to higher yields on shortterm cash investments and higher invested cash balances 

interest expense in fiscal 2015 was 620 million compared to 487 million in fiscal 2014 and 409 million in fiscal 2013 the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense over these periods relates to 57 million in noncash interest expense on the amortization of the debt discount of our 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures and 38 million of interest expense related to the 1625 coupon as well as increased borrowings under our credit facility to partially finance our acquisition activity and increased expenses associated with our larger credit facility 

loss on retirement of convertible debentures in fiscal 2015 was 506 million in february 2015 we acquired certain of our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures with a 5750 million aggregate principal amount for an aggregate purchase price of 11346 million based on market value the transaction resulted in a loss on retirement of convertible debentures of approximately 506 million which represented the difference between the fair value of the liability component at time of repurchase and the sum of the carrying values of the debt component and any unamortized debt issuance costs 

other income net in fiscal 2015 was 137 million compared to other income net of 59 million in fiscal 2014 and other expense net of 04 million in fiscal 2013 the primary reasons for the change in other income net during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 relates to realized gains of 187 million from the sale of marketable equity and debt securities and fluctuations on our foreign currency derivatives the primary reasons for the change in other income expense net during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 relates to realized gains of 24 million from the sale of marketable equity and debt securities and a gain of 24 million recognized on a strategic investment in a company we acquired during fiscal 2014 compared to a gain of 13 million related to the sale of inventory previously considered discontinued during fiscal 2013 and fluctuations on our foreign currency derivatives 

provision for income taxes 

  

our provision for income taxes reflects tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings we had an effective tax rate of 56 in fiscal 2015 86 in fiscal 2014 and 163 in fiscal 2013 excluding certain onetime tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the rd tax credit our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 includes 331 million of benefits related to audit closures and expirations of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves which reduced our effective tax rate by 96 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 also includes a 18 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit which reduced our effective tax rate by 05 during fiscal 2014 our effective tax rate included 194 million of benefits related to various items including a settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves these benefits reduced our effective tax rate by 45 to an effective tax rate of 86 during fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate was higher due to 272 million of onetime foreign and domestic tax implications from our acquisition of smsc which offset an 81 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit and 97 million of other nonrecurring tax events including releases of previously established tax reserves related to audit closures and expirations of statutes of limitations and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities these items increased our effective tax rate by 62 to an effective tax rate of 163 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2011 and later tax returns remain open for examination by the taxing authorities we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future any expiration of our tax holidays are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and an increase in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 23422 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2015  an increase of 1987 million from the march 31 2014  balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities and our credit agreement and convertible debenture financing activities being offset in part by dividend payments of 2865 million and our acquisition activity 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 7212 million for fiscal 2015  6766 million for fiscal 2014  and 4594 million for fiscal 2013  the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to higher net sales during fiscal 2015  the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily due to higher net sales and net income during fiscal 2014 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 6783 million for fiscal 2015  5033 million for fiscal 2014  and 9499 million in fiscal 2013  the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was due primarily to 2525 million of cash consideration net of 151 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired used to finance our acquisition of issc in july 2014 and 3754 million of cash consideration net of 148 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired used to finance our acquisition of supertex in april 2014 offset in part by an increase in cash from our purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale investments in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily due to our acquisition of smsc in fiscal 2013 which used 7317 million of cash consideration net of 1809 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired this decrease in net cash used in investing activities offset a fiscal 2014 decrease in cash related to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 1495 million in fiscal 2015  1131 million in fiscal 2014  and 508 million in fiscal 2013  capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 160 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase our capacity 

  

we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

net cash provided by financing activities was 985 million for fiscal 2015 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2350   million for fiscal 2014 and net cash provided by financing activities of 3822 million for fiscal 2013 we made payments on our borrowings under our credit agreements of 20476 million during fiscal 2015  11035 million during fiscal 2014  and 7610 million during fiscal 2013  cash received on borrowings under our credit agreements totaled 18596 million during fiscal 2015  11335 million during fiscal 2014  and 13810 million during fiscal 2013  in february 2015 we issued 17250 million principal amount of 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures due february 15 2025 the debentures are subordinated to our senior debt including amounts borrowed under our amended credit facility but are senior to our outstanding 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures also in february 2015 we acquired certain of our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures with a 5750 million aggregate principal amount for an aggregate purchase price of 11346 million based on market value we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of 2865 million in fiscal 2015  2812 million in fiscal 2014  and 2738 million in fiscal 2013  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were 344 million for fiscal 2015  601 million for fiscal 2014  and 514 million for fiscal 2013  

in february 2015 we amended our 20 billion credit agreement with certain lenders the revolving credit facility portion of the agreement was increased from 16500 million to 25550 million and the 3500 million term loan portion of the agreement was removed the increase option permitting us subject to certain requirements to arrange with existing lenders andor new lenders to provide up to an aggregate of 300 million in additional commitments was also adjusted to 249 million proceeds of loans made under the credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes at march 31 2015 4620 million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit agreement 

our total cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was 23224 million at march 31 2015  and 20857 million at march 31 2014  under current tax laws and regulations if accumulated earnings and profits held by our foreign subsidiaries that us taxes had not previously been provided for were to be distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments available for our us operations as of march 31 2015  and march 31 2014 was approximately 198 million and 578 million respectively we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed we consider our offshore earnings to be permanently reinvested offshore however we could determine to repatriate some of our offshore earnings in future periods to fund stockholder dividends share repurchases acquisitions or other corporate activities we expect that a significant portion of our future cash generation will be in our foreign subsidiaries 

in march 2015 we entered into tenyear fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements on a portion of our fixedrate 1625 senior subordinated convertible debentures the interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges we pay variable interest equal to the threemonth libor minus 536 basis points and we receive a fixed interest rate of 1625 the gross notional amount of these contracts outstanding at march 31 2015 was 4313 million 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2015  we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

in december 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2015  we had repurchased 75 million shares under this 10 million share authorization for a total of 2347 million in may 2015 our board of directors authorized an increase in the existing share repurchase program to 200 million shares of common stock from the approximately 25 million shares remaining under the current authorization under this program in the next several months we intend to repurchase the approximate number of shares we will issue in connection with our acquisition of micrel there is no expiration date associated with this program the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon market conditions interest rates and corporate considerations 

  

as of march 31 2015  we held approximately 167 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 252 billion during fiscal 2015  we paid dividends in the amount of 1425 per share for a total dividend payment of 2865 million during fiscal 2014  we paid dividends in the amount of 1417 per share for a total dividend payment of 2812 million during fiscal 2013  we paid dividends in the amount of 1406 per share for a total dividend payment of 2738 million on may 7 2015 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 03575 per share which will be paid on june 4 2015  to stockholders of record on may 21 2015  and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 724 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may increase our borrowings under our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2015 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2015 dollars in thousands 















purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of march 31 2015  we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201412 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period  the amendments in this asu provide explicit guidance on whether a performance target contained in a sharebased payment award that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated i as a performance condition that affects vesting or ii as a nonvesting condition that affects the grantdate fair value of the award the amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition rather than as a nonvesting condition accordingly such performance targets are not reflected in the estimation of the grant date fair value of the award compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered if the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the 

remaining service period the total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate adoption of this asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  asu 201311 to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits asu 201311 requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except as follows to the extent a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets asu 201311 was effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2015 with earlier adoption permitted asu 201311 should be applied prospectively with retroactive application permitted there was no income statement impact to us as a result of adopting this accounting standard 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we are evaluating our existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the guidance will be materially affected by the new requirements the effects may include identifying performance obligations in existing arrangements estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation the new standard is effective beginning with the first quarter of our 2018 fiscal year early adoption is not permitted the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements on april 1 2015 the fasb proposed deferring the effective date by one year to december 15 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date the fasb also proposed permitting early adoption of the standard but not before the original effective date of december 15 2016 we are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs   this standard amends existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge it is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 but early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements

the board of directors and stockholders of 

microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries 

  

we have audited microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2015  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 1992 framework the coso criteria microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2015  based on the coso criteria

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

  

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit often with on board nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various analog and digital inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software various analog mixedsignal and connectivity products and nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and flash memory 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the significant segments of the semiconductor market at approximately 15 billion in calendar year 2013 microcontrollers are primarily available in 8bit through 32bit architectures 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of highvolume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent a significant portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications the analog and mixedsignal segment of the semiconductor market is very large at approximately 40 billion in calendar year 2013 and this market is fragmented into a large number of sub segments 

  

our products 

  

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

  

 

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development thus enabling timely and costeffective integration of our solutions by our customers in their end products 

microcontrollers 

we offer a broad family of proprietary general purpose microcontroller products marketed under the pic ®  brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 13 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 we also offer specialized microcontrollers for automotive networking computing wireless communication and wireless audio applications with over 1100 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontroller markets 

  

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our small footprint flexible extreme low power lowcost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

  

development tools 

  

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program pic microcontrollers for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for facilitating design wins 

  

our family of development tools for our pic products range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation capability customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our pic development tools share the same integrated development environment 

  

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are approximately 200 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

  

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped over 16 million development tools 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products 

  

our analog interface and mixed signal products consist of several families with over 1100 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management rf linear drivers safety and security usb ethernet wireless and other interface products 

  

we market and sell our analog interface and mixed signal products into our microcontroller customer base to customers who use microcontrollers from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

memory products 

our memory products consist of serial electrically erasable programmable readonly memory referred to as serial eeproms serial flash memories parallel flash memories and serial sram memories serial eeproms serial flash memories and serial sram have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small footprint devices we sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

  

technology licensing 

  

our technology licensing business includes license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of our superflash ®  embedded flash and smartbits ®  one time programmable nvm technologies we also generate fees for engineering services related to these technologies we license our nvm technologies to foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products gate array rf and analog products that require embedded nonvolatile memory 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased due to our acquisitions of companies that outsource all or substantial portions of their manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 microns to 50 microns during fiscal 2014 in response to uncertain global economic conditions and our inventory position we decided to operate fab 2 below normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be in the range of 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies was increased during fiscal 2014 by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 022 microns to 05 microns manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns similar to fab 2 fab 4 operated below normal capacity levels during fiscal 2014 a significant amount of additional clean room capacity and equipment in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we have in recent years outsourced a larger portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities as a result of our recent acquisitions we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2014 approximately 38 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

  

wafer probe assembly and test 

  

we perform wafer probe product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand we also perform a limited amount of wafer probe at our chandler arizona facility during fiscal 2014 approximately 51 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facilities and approximately 86 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

at the end of fiscal 2014 we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3119 million and 2201 million in other countries including 1791 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2013 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3253 million and 1892 million in other countries including 1711 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2012 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3143 million and 2023 million in other countries including 1861 million in thailand 

we have many suppliers of raw materials and subcontractors which provide our various materials and service needs we generally seek to have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services but in some cases we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers in such event we have plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of general purpose and specialized microcontrollers serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies connectivity products analog interface and mixed signal products development systems user interface products software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design assembly test and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2014 our rd expenses were 3050   million compared to 2547   million in fiscal 2013 and 1827 million in fiscal 2012 rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of 246   million in fiscal 2014 222 million in fiscal 2013 and 147 million in fiscal 2012 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we derived 53 of our net sales through distributors and 47 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2012 we derived 59 of our net sales through distributors and 41 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us future electronics one of our distributors accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were as follows dollars in thousands 



sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 83 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 82 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 29 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 and approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 

our international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however in recent periods changes in global economic and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2014 our backlog was approximately 8131 million compared to 6110 million as of april 30 2013 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china korea and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2014 and 2031 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize new and enhanced products rather than on our patents our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful intellectual property protection or any commercial advantage to us pursuing violations of our intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex business area involving patent law trademark law copyright law and the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual 

property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2014 we had 8604 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock adverse global economic conditions the subsequent economic recovery and uncertainty surrounding the strength of such recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity for example in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we reduced wafer starts in both fab 2 and fab 4 to help control inventory balances in response to a slowdown in global economic conditions we continued with the reduced level of wafer starts through the first quarter of fiscal 2013 these actions had a negative impact on our gross profit we further reduced the wafer starts in our fabs in late september 2012 and again during the quarter ended december 31 2012 which continued to negatively impact our gross profit through the march 2013 quarter we increased wafer starts modestly throughout fiscal 2014 but were still below what we consider normal capacity levels 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore have limited visibility to future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make it more difficult to forecast net sales as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 12 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface and mixed signal products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface and mixed signal products have declined over time 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash technology also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs we also use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products our reliance on third party contractors and foundries increased as a result of our acquisition of smsc in august 2012 and will increase further as a result of our acquisition of supertex in april 2014 although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties somewhat reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all or on terms favorable to us additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies that we desire to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further use of subcontractors increases opportunities for potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if our licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by our distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to timely design develop and introduce competitive products which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash technology the success of our licensing business will depend on the continued market acceptance of this technology and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technology and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our superflash technology is complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technology there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business in recent 

periods and changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and have made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse customer base across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses in this regard in april 2014 we completed our acquisition of supertex and in august 2012 we completed our acquisition of smsc the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we may be subject to claims from terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional stockbased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our credit agreement raising debt issuing shares of common stock or other mechanisms 

further if we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors or other third parties and such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the relationships that we have with our suppliers this could impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers or licensees from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to 

infringement claims made against us our customers or our licensees by third parties these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell our expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not have sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers but where we do certain terms of such contracts expose us to risks and liabilities 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had approximately 84000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 10 of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale further as a result of our acquisitions of smsc and supertex we inherited certain customer contracts that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to limit the number of contracts that we sign which contain such special provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we may not be able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we have been and may in the future be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years however our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally as described above operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline as our licenses are based on per unit royalties 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2014 approximately 84 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 29 in china during fiscal 2013 approximately 83 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 27 in china a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition in the china market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities near bangkok thailand which is currently experiencing political instability and has experienced periods of political instability in the past from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we use various foreign contractors for a significant portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results    

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar such as past declines in the euro relative to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches additionally failure to properly manage the collection handling transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations litigation fines and other sanctions 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems however such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us were future attacks successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects until significant harm is done in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus measures patches log monitors routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password modifications there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attack or disruptions any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of internal systems defending litigation responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as wafer foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold security breaches and loss of data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results as well as our relationship with our customers 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we believe that it is more cost effective for us to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects employment risks political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with many federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products and energy efficiency measures these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices or may charge us more for complying with them the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

customer demands and new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released new disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in products necessary to the functionality or production of products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties we must file a report on form sd with the sec regarding such matters by june 2 2014 and on an annual basis thereafter other countries are considering similar regulations as we implement these new requirements if it is determined that we are using other than conflictfree minerals customers may demand us to change the sourcing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products even if the costs for compliant minerals significantly increases and availability is limited if we make changes to materials andor suppliers there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity and quality could be negatively impacted there will likely be additional costs associated with complying with these new disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we may implement we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with these or other export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2011 and later microchip and smsc are currently under irs audit for fiscal 2011 and 2012 we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2006 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill or material longlived asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2014 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

in june 2013 we entered into a 20 billion credit agreement at march 31 2014 we had 6500 million in outstanding borrowings under such credit agreement in december 2007 we sold 115 billion of principal value 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures as a result of such transactions we have a substantially greater amount of debt than we had maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our loans under our credit agreement our debentures or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective 

potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in recent years there have been a number of initiatives proposed by the obama administration and members of congress regarding the tax treatment of such undistributed earnings if adopted certain of these initiatives would substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the us changes in tax law such as these proposals could have a material negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change pose regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct business 

climate change regulations could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages higher costs of water or energy to control the temperature of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as thailand and arizona some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 –  business item 6 –  selected financial data and item 8 –  financial statements and supplementary data 

  

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 34 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial 

commitments in the sections titled liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on the embedded control market which includes microcontrollers highperformance analog interface and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices connectivity devices interface devices serial eeproms superflash memory products our patented keeloq ®  security devices and flash ip solutions we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers we license our superflash technology to wafer foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory analog and mixedsignal products flaship systems new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

  

we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management personnel have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes junior subordinated convertible debentures and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to original equipment manufacturers oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

  

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2014 we had approximately 2228 million of deferred revenue and 750 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1478 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2013 we 

had approximately 2018 million of deferred revenue and 628 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1390 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 928 million at march 31 2014 and 701 million at march 31 2013 on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

  

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

  

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets and acquired investments in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments acquired also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activity by the investees the investees capital structure and the terms of the investees issued interests 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2014 was 538 million of which 464 million was reflected in operating expenses total sharebased compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal 2014 was 73 million total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 57 million at march 31 2014 

  

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans option pricing models including the blackscholes model require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is most reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts we estimate the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the impact on prior period amortization for all unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2014 was immaterial 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

  

in  periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabrication facilities approximately 190 million 317 million and 67 million was charged directly to cost of sales in fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

as  part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets including state net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and state tax credits where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized at march 31 2014 the valuation allowances totaled 938 million should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2014 our deferred tax asset net of valuation allowances was 2382   million 

  

various  taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations microchip and smsc are currently under irs audit for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

junior subordinated convertible debentures 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our junior subordinated convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion price per share which was 2587 at march 31 2014 and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are not generally determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of flash intellectual property we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

  

our net sales of 19312   million in fiscal 2014 increased by 3496 million or 221 over fiscal 2013 and our net sales of 15816 million in fiscal 2013 increased by 1984 million or 144 from fiscal 2012 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 was due primarily to general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 was also impacted by our acquisition of smsc on august 2 2012 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 was due primarily to our acquisition of smsc offset in part by adverse general economic and semiconductor industry conditions average selling prices for our semiconductor products were up approximately 4 in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 and were up approximately 5 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was up approximately 17 in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 and up approximately 10 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

net sales by product line for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows dollars in thousands 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 653  of our total net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 655  of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 and 671  of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 218 in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and increased approximately 115 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 resulted primarily from market share gains and general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets we serve including the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets the increase in net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from our acquisition of smsc and market share gains which offset weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products 

  

sales of our analog interface and mixed signal products accounted for approximately 222  of our total net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 194  of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 124  of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 

  

net sales of our analog interface and mixed signal products increased approximately 391 in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and increased approximately 798 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by general economic and semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains achieved within the analog interface and mixed signal market the increase in net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc and market share gains achieved within the analog interface and mixed signal market 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than 80 of our analog interface and mixed signal product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface and mixed signal business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface and mixed signal products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface and mixed signal products will increase over time 

  

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 70  of our total net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 90  of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 130  of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 

  

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 56 in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and decreased approximately 205 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the decreases in memory product net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 were driven primarily by adverse customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets 

  

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash technology and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 49  of our total net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 53  of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 63  of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 

net sales related to our technology licensing increased approximately 129 in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and decreased approximately 37 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the increase in technology licensing net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by the adoption of our technology by more manufacturers of semiconductors as well as semiconductor industry and global economic conditions the decrease in technology licensing net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was due primarily to adverse semiconductor industry and global economic conditions 

  

other 

  

revenue from assembly and test subcontracting services accounted for approximately 06  of our total net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 08  of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 12  of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 and approximately 59 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 the decrease in distributor net sales as a percentage of our total net sales in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc which makes a larger percentage of its net sales to oem customers rather than through distributors 

  

our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 one of our distributors future electronics accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2014 our distributors maintained 33 days of inventory of our products compared to 30 days at march 31 2013 and 31 days at march 31 2012 over the past three fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

  

net sales by geography 

  

net sales by geography for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows dollars in thousands 



our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 84 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 83 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 82 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their 

manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market as well as our acquisitions such as smsc which had a significant concentration of sales in asia our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 29 of our net sales in fiscal 2014 approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 and approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 11287 million in fiscal 2014 8385 million in fiscal 2013 and 7993 million in fiscal 2012 gross profit as a percent of sales was 584 in fiscal 2014 530 in fiscal 2013 and 578 in fiscal 2012 

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and the second half of fiscal 2012 in response to uncertain global economic conditions and our inventory position as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs approximately 190 million 317 million and 67 was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively in the future if production levels are below normal capacity we will charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity during fiscal 2014 and the first half of fiscal 2012 we operated at the normal levels of capacity at our thailand assembly and test facility and we selectively increased our assembly and test capacity at such facility during such time during fiscal 2013 and the second half of fiscal 2012 we operated below the normal capacity levels of our thailand assembly and test facility due to adverse business conditions and these actions had a negative impact on our gross margins during such periods 

  

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 micron to 10 micron processes fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 022 micron to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

our overall inventory levels were 2627 million at march 31 2014 compared to 2423 million at march 31 2013 and 2173 million at march 31 2012 we maintained 118 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2014 compared to 116 days of inventory at march 31 2013 and 138 days at march 31 2012 we expect our inventory levels in the june 2014 quarter to decrease between 7 and 11 days from the march 2014 levels we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times provide strong delivery performance to our customers and allow us to keep our fiscal 2015 capital expenditures at relatively low levels 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface and mixed signal products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

during fiscal 2014 approximately 51 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 60 during fiscal 2013 and approximately 66 during fiscal 2012 the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations during fiscal 2014 approximately 86 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 87 during fiscal 2013 and approximately 92 during fiscal 2012 we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements during fiscal 2014 approximately 38 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to approximately 33 during fiscal 2013 and approximately 20 during fiscal 2012 the primary reason for the increased percentage in fiscal 2014 over the previous two fiscal years was our acquisition of smsc in the september 2012 quarter as smsc relied solely on outside wafer foundries for their wafer fabrication requirements 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2014 were 3050 million or 158 of sales compared to 2547 million or 161 of sales for fiscal 2013 and 1827 million or 132 of sales for fiscal 2012 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 503 million or 198 for fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc as well as higher headcount costs and bonus costs rd expenses increased 721 million or 395 for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc and higher headcount costs 

rd expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 were 2673   million or 138 of sales compared to 2615 million or 165 of sales for fiscal 2013 and 2083 million or 151 of sales for fiscal 2012 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 58 million or 22 for fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 were higher headcount costs related to our acquisition of smsc and higher bonus costs partially offset by lower acquisition related legal expenses professional services and sharebased compensation selling general and administrative expenses increased 532   million or 255 for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the primary reason for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

special charges 

  

acquisition related expenses 

  

during fiscal 2014 we incurred special charges of  30 million  related to severance office closing and other costs associated with our acquisition activity during fiscal 2013 we incurred special charges of 322 million comprised of a 44 million net increase in the fair value of contingent consideration related to one of our acquisitions 163 million of primarily severancerelated costs in addition to office closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of smsc and legal settlement costs of approximately 115 million for certain legal matters related to sst which we acquired in april 2010 in excess of previously accrued amounts during fiscal 2012 special charges included a benefit of 07 million comprised of a 10 million favorable adjustment to contingent consideration offset by 03 million of severancerelated charges related to a prior year acquisition 

  

patent licenses 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we agreed to the terms of a patent license with an unrelated third party and signed an agreement on march 20 2012 the patent license settled alleged infringement claims the total payment made to the thirdparty in march 2012 was 28 million 15 million of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the remaining 13 million was recorded as a prepaid royalty which will be amortized over the remaining life of the patents which expire in december 2018 

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2014 was 165 million compared to 156 million in fiscal 2013 and 180 million in fiscal 2012 the primary reasons for the increase in interest income for fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 relates to higher yields on shortterm cash investments and higher invested cash balances the primary reasons for the decrease in interest income for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 relates to lower yields on shortterm cash investments and lower invested cash balances interest expense in fiscal 2014 was 487 million compared to 409 million in fiscal 2013 and 343 million in fiscal 2012 the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense over these periods relates to increased borrowings under our credit facility to partially finance our acquisition of smsc and increased expenses associated with our larger credit facility other income net in fiscal 2014 was 59 million compared to other expense net of 04 million in fiscal 2013 and other expense net of 04 million in fiscal 2012 the primary reasons for the change in other income expense net during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 relates to realized gains of 24 million from the sale of marketable equity and debt securities and a gain of 24 million recognized on a strategic investment in a company we acquired during fiscal 2014 compared to a gain of 13 million related to the sale of inventory previously considered discontinued during fiscal 2013 and fluctuations on our foreign currency derivatives 

provision for income taxes 

  

our provision for income taxes reflects tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings we had an effective tax rate of 86 in fiscal 2014 163 in fiscal 2013 and 113 in fiscal 2012 excluding certain onetime tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the rd tax credit our effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 includes 194 million of benefits related to various items including a settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves these benefits reduced our effective tax rate by 45 percentage points to an effective tax rate of 86 during fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate was higher due to 272 million of onetime foreign and domestic tax implications from our acquisition of smsc which offset an 81 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit and 97 million of other nonrecurring tax events including releases of previously established tax reserves related to audit closures and expirations of statutes of limitations and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities these items increased our effective tax rate by 62 to an effective tax rate of 163 during fiscal 2012 we completed a project that led to additional rd tax credit claims in the amount of 41 million which reduced our effective tax rate by 11 to 113 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations for us federal and in general for us state tax returns our fiscal 2011 and later tax returns remain open for examination by the taxing authorities smsc is currently under audit for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future any expiration of our tax holidays are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and an increase in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 21435 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2014 an increase of 3075 million from the march 31 2013 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities being offset in part by dividend payments of 2812 million 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 6766 million for fiscal 2014 4594 million for fiscal 2013 and 4120 million for fiscal 2012 the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher net sales and net income during fiscal 2014 the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 5033 million for fiscal 2014 9499 million for fiscal 2013 and 2720 million in fiscal 2012 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to our acquisition of smsc in fiscal 2013 which used 7317 million of cash consideration net of 1809 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired this decrease in net cash used in investing activities offset a fiscal 2014 decrease in cash related to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to our acquisition of smsc in fiscal 2013 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 1131 million in fiscal 2014 508 million in fiscal 2013 and 624 million in fiscal 2012 capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 125 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase our capacity 

  

we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

net cash used in financing activities was 2350 million for fiscal 2014 net cash provided by financing activities was 3822   million for fiscal 2013 and net cash used in financing activities was 2081 million for fiscal 2012 we made payments on our borrowings under our credit agreements of 11035 million and 7610 million during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 respectively cash received on borrowings under our credit agreements totaled 11335 million and 13810 million during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 respectively we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of 2812 million in fiscal 2014 2738 million in fiscal 2013 and 2662 million in fiscal 2012 proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were 374 million for fiscal 2014 357 million for fiscal 2013 and 575 million for fiscal 2012 

on june 27 2013 we entered into a 20 billion credit agreement with certain lenders the credit agreement provides for a 3500 million term loan and a 165 billion revolving credit facility with a 125 million foreign currency sublimit a 35 million letter of credit sublimit and a 25 million swingline loan sublimit terminating on june 27 2018 the credit agreement also contains an increase option permitting us subject to certain requirements to arrange with existing lenders 

andor new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of 300 million in additional commitments which may be for revolving loans or term loans proceeds of loans made under the credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes the new credit agreement replaced another credit agreement we had in place since august 2011 at march 31 2014 6500 million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement consisting of 3000 million of a revolving line of credit and 3500 million of a term loan net of 11 million of debt discount resulting from amounts paid to the lenders see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the credit agreement 

our total cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was 20857 million at march 31 2014  and 17820 million at march 31 2013 under current tax laws and regulations if accumulated earnings and profits held by our foreign subsidiaries that us taxes had not previously been provided for were to be distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments available for our us operations as of march 31 2014  and march 31 2013 was approximately 578 million and 1000 million respectively we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed we consider our offshore earnings to be permanently reinvested offshore however we could determine to repatriate some of our offshore earnings in future periods to fund stockholder dividends share repurchases acquisitions or other corporate activities we expect that a significant portion of our future cash generation will be in our foreign subsidiaries 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2014  we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

on december 11 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2014  we had repurchased 75 million shares under this 10 million share authorization for a total of 2347 million there is no expiration date associated with this program the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon market conditions interest rates and corporate considerations 

  

as of march 31 2014  we held approximately 188 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 223 billion during fiscal 2014 we paid dividends in the amount of 1417 per share for a total dividend payment of 2812 million during fiscal 2013 we paid dividends in the amount of 1406 per share for a total dividend payment of 2738 million during fiscal 2012 we paid dividends in the amount of 1390 per share for a total dividend payment of 2662 million on may 6 2014 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 03555 per share which will be paid on june 3 2014 to stockholders of record on may 21 2014 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 711 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may further borrow under our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities for cash dividends or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2014 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2014 dollars in thousands 













purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of march 31 2014  we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in may of 2014 the fasb issued accounting standard update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we are carefully evaluating our existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any contracts in the scope of the guidance will be affected by the new requirements the effects may include identifying performance obligations in existing arrangements estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation the new standard is effective beginning the first quarter of our 2018 fiscal year early adoption is not permitted the standard allows for either “full retrospective” adoption meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or “modified retrospective” adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements we are currently evaluating the transition method that will be elected 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we adopted the provisions of accounting standard update 201302 comprehensive income topic 220 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which required the disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to net income the adoption of this provision did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our investments are intended to establish a highquality portfolio that preserves principal meets liquidity needs avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities money market funds cash deposits and marketable securities that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 21435   million as of march 31 2014 compared to 18360 million as of march 31 2013 the availableforsale debt securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

  

 3 

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit often with on board nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms flash memory and various analog and interface products 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market at approximately 15 billion in calendar year 2012 microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures 4bit microcontrollers are the smallest segment of the microcontroller market and have been in decline for several years 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of highvolume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent a significant portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications 

  

our products 

  

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

  

 

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

microcontrollers 

we offer a broad family of proprietary general purpose microcontroller products marketed under the pic brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 12 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our pic products are designed for applications requiring field programmability high performance low power and cost effectiveness our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set computer referred to as risc and variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative singlebus complex instruction set computer architectures referred to as cisc we also offer specialized microcontrollers for automotive networking computing wireless communication and wireless audio with over 1000 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontroller markets 

  

digital signal controllers dsc are a subset of our 16bit microcontroller offering our dspic   dsc families integrate the control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of digital signal processors dsps along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application 

libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic dscs expand our addressable market 

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our small footprint flexible extreme low power lowcost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

  

development tools 

  

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic dsc for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

  

our family of development tools for our pic and dspic products range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation capability customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our pic and dspic development tools share the same integrated development environment 

  

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are approximately 200 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

  

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped almost 15 million development tools 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products 

  

our analog interface and mixed signal products consist of several families with over 1000 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management rf linear drivers safety and security usb ethernet wireless and other interface products 

  

we market and sell our analog interface and mixed signal products into our microcontroller customer base to customers who use microcontrollers from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

memory products 

our memory products consist of serial electrically erasable programmable readonly memory referred to as serial eeproms serial flash memories parallel flash memories and serial sram memories serial eeproms serial flash memories and serial sram have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small footprint devices we sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

  

technology licensing 

  

our technology licensing business includes license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of our superflash ®  technology and fees for engineering services we license our superflash    technology to foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products gate array rf and analog products that require embedded flash 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing increased due to our acquisition of standard microsystems corporation smsc which outsourced all of its manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 to 50 microns during fiscal 2013 in response to weak global economic conditions fab 2 operated below normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be in the range of 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies was increased during fiscal 2013 by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment as required 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 022 to 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns similar to fab 2 fab 4 was operating below normal capacity levels during fiscal 2013 a significant amount of additional clean room capacity and equipment in fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we have in recent years outsourced a larger portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities as a result of our recent acquisitions we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2013 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 33 and 38 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

  

wafer probe assembly and test 

  

we perform wafer probe product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand we also perform a limited amount of wafer probe at our chandler arizona facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 56 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facilities and approximately 84 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements during fiscal 2013 due to weak economic and semiconductor industry conditions we operated at levels below the total operating capacity of our thailand facilities 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller analog and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic analog and memory product lines we use a common process technology for our microcontroller analog and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products 

to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

at the end of fiscal 2013 we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3253 million and 1892 million in other countries including 1711 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2012 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3143 million and 2023 million in other countries including 1861 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2011 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3300 million and 2105 million in other countries including 1937 million in thailand 

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of general purpose and specialized microcontrollers digital signal controllers serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies rf products analog interface and mixed signal products development systems user interface products software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2013 our rd expenses were 2547   million compared to 1827   million in fiscal 2012 and 1706 million in fiscal 2011 rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of 222   million in fiscal 2013 147 million in fiscal 2012 and 129 million in fiscal 2011 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2013 we derived 53 of our net sales through distributors and 47 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2012 we derived 59 of our net sales through distributors and 41 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us the decrease in distributor net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to prior periods was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc which makes a larger percentage of its net sales to oem customers rather than through distributors in fiscal 2011 we derived 58 of our net sales through distributors and 42 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us our largest distributor future electronics accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were as follows dollars in thousands 



sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 83 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 82 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 80 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 

our international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however in recent periods changes in global economic and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2013 our backlog was approximately 6110 million compared to 3288 million as of april 30 2012 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

  

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china korea and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2013 and 2031 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful intellectual property protection or any commercial advantage to us pursuing violations of our intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex business area involving patent law trademark law copyright law and the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual 

property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2013 we had 8003 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative 

effect on the price of our common stock adverse global economic conditions the subsequent economic recovery and uncertainty surrounding the strength of such recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity for example in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we reduced wafer starts in both fab 2 and fab 4 to help control inventory balances in response to a slowdown in global economic conditions we continued with the reduced level of wafer starts through the first quarter of fiscal 2013 these actions had a negative impact on our gross profit we further reduced the wafer starts in our fabs in late september 2012 and again during the quarter ended december 31 2012 which continued to negatively impact our gross profit through the march 2013 quarter 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures including our acquisition of smsc 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses in this regard on august 2 2012 we completed our acquisition of smsc a publicly traded semiconductor company the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company including smsc or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we may be subject to claims by terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional stockbased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash borrowings under our credit agreement raising debt issuing shares of common stock or other mechanisms 

while the risks above may be relevant to all of our acquisitions our acquisition of smsc was a larger and more complex transaction than our other recent transactions and exposes us to greater risks and liabilities than we have encountered in the past 

further when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors or other third parties and such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and customer orders that are both received and shipped in that same quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast as a significant portion of our products are manufactured at foundries foundry lead times may affect our ability to achieve certain turns orders if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog interface and mixed signal products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog interface and mixed signal products have declined over time 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 59 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by distributors or other channel partners could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

our technology licensing business is based on our superflash technology the success of our licensing business will depend on the continued market acceptance of this technology and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technology and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our superflash technology is complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technology there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees 

and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash technology also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication needs we also use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products our reliance on third party contractors and foundries has increased as a result of our acquisition of smsc although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all or on terms favorable to us additionally these subcontractors could abandon fabrication processes that are important to us or fail to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies desired to control costs in any such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected further use of these subcontractors creates increased opportunities for potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 

certain of our superflash technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if the licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from the wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various materials and equipment that meet our standards the materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases additionally consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change the relationships that we have with our suppliers this could impair sourcing flexibility or increase costs we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts an interruption of any materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business in recent periods and changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and have made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement other intellectual property rights contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers or licensees from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to 

infringement claims made against us the customers or licensees by third parties these legal proceedings and claims even if meritless could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected end customer system issues due to the interaction with our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell our expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions certain of our contracts may not exclude such liabilities further our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or interactions with our products cause system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers but where we do we may be subject to liability 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had approximately 82000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 10 of our total revenue for fiscal 2013 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits smsc has a higher concentration of larger customers and we expect the overall percentage of revenue from our top ten customers to increase due to our acquisition of smsc 

we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale further as a result of our acquisition of smsc we inherited certain customer contracts that differ from our standard terms of sale for several of the significant markets that we sell into such as the automotive and personal computer markets our current or potential customers may possess significant leverage over us in negotiating the terms and conditions of supply as a result of their market size and position for example under certain contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for quality issues or claims of intellectual property infringement if we are unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to limit the number of contracts that we sign which contain such special provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure sometimes we may not be able to do so in order to win important designs avoid losing business to competitors maintain existing business or be permitted to bid on new business we may be forced to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringement or confidentiality such provisions expose us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products we sell under such contracts the lifetime revenues we receive from such products or various forms of potential consequential damages these significant additional risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering manufacturing and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business the loss of or any inability to attract personnel even if not key personnel if experienced in sufficient numbers could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years however our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally as described above operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could 

suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline as our licenses are based on per unit royalties 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2013 approximately 83 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 27 in china during fiscal 2012 approximately 82 of our net sales were made to foreign customers including 24 in china a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the market for integrated circuit products in china is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share increased competition in the china market may make it difficult for us to achieve our desired sales volumes in china we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize or are worse than we anticipate our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results    

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar such as past declines in the euro relative to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant disruption to our systems or networks including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues natural disasters terrorism war telecommunication failures or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches additionally as there has been 

increased legislation in the us europe and elsewhere regarding the handling of personal data including the data of employees and customers such a failure may result in regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations and litigation there is also risk that we may be found not to comply with laws or regulations regarding the collection consent handling transfer or disposal of personal data fines and other sanctions may result 

from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our it systems however such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us were future attacks successful we may be unaware of the incident its magnitude or its effects in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus measures patches log monitors routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password modifications there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attack or disruptions any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of internal systems defending litigation responding to regulatory actions or paying damages such attacks or disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold security breaches and loss of our data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we have determined that it is more cost effective to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects employment risks political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental and other regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with many federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to buy costly equipment or to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations our failure to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could impact the health of our employees and others and could impact our ability to operate such failure could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses there is a continuing expansion in environmental laws with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances and substances of high concern in electronic products and shipping materials these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture sell and ship our products in addition the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packing materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold inventory that is not saleable as a result of changes to regulations or customer requirements we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of substances of high concern in our products and energy efficiency measures these requirements may increase our own costs as well as those passed on to us by our supply chain 

customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than applicable legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incur higher costs 

some of our customers and potential customers are more frequently requiring that we implement operating practices that are more stringent than what is required by applicable laws with respect to workplace and labor requirements the type of materials we use in our products environmental matters or other items to comply with such requirements we may have to pass these same operating practices on to our suppliers our suppliers may refuse to implement these operating practices or 

may charge us more for complying with them the cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our profitability and if we choose not to implement such practices such customers may disqualify us as a supplier resulting in decreased revenue opportunities developing administering monitoring and auditing these customerrequested practices at our own sites and those in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require that we hire more personnel 

customer demands and new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in august 2012 the sec released new disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties as we implement these new requirements if it is determined that we are using other than conflictfree minerals customers may demand us to change the sourcing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products even if the costs for acceptable minerals significantly increases and availability is limited there will likely be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we may implement we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or foreign government that we have failed to comply with these or other export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2009 and later we are currently being audited by the irs for fiscal 2009 and 2010 and smsc is currently under irs audit for fiscal 2011 and 2012 we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2005 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 20 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of our future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill or longlived asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2013 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

as a result of our sale of 115 billion of principal value 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures in december 2007 we have a substantially greater amount of longterm debt than we had maintained in the past in august 2011 we entered into a 750 million revolving credit agreement we borrowed approximately 620 million under such credit agreement to help fund our acquisition of smsc in august 2012 our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our debentures or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective 

potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in recent years there have been a number of initiatives proposed by the obama administration and members of congress regarding the tax treatment of such undistributed earnings if adopted certain of these initiatives would substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the us changes in tax law such as these proposals could have a material negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

credit conditions have adversely impacted our holdings of auction rate securities ars 

at march 31 2013 338   million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars with the continuing liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets since 2008 our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions and are not liquid while we continue to earn interest on these investments based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices the estimated market value for a portion of these ars no longer approximates the original purchase value 

the fair value of the failed ars of 338 million has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions we evaluated the impairments in the value of these ars determining our intent to sell these securities prior to the recovery of our amortized cost basis which resulted in some of the securities being otherthan temporarily impaired and recognized impairment charges on these investments of 04 million in fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2012 we recognized a 03 million gain on our ars positions as a gain on redemption at par value of one ars position offset impairment charges recognized during the year if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings 

the majority of our short and longterm investments are in highly rated government agency bonds and corporate bonds other than with respect to our holdings of ars we have not experienced any liquidity or impairment issues with such investments however there can be no assurance that credit market conditions will not in the future adversely affect the liquidity or value of our nonars investments 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business 

climate change regulations could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment new permits may be required for our current operations or expansions thereof failure to timely receive permits could result in fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages higher costs for water or energy to control the temperature inside of our facilities certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions such as thailand and arizona some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can interrupt business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 34 we discuss our results of continuing operations for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

acquisition of smsc 

on august 2 2012 we closed our acquisition of smsc and smsc became a wholly owned subsidiary of microchip we financed the transaction using approximately 3127 million of our existing balance of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and borrowings of approximately 6000 million under our existing credit agreement at august 2 2012 smsc had approximately 2052 million of cash and investments on its balance sheet smsc is a leading developer of smart mixedsignal connectivity™ solutions smsc is focused on delivering connectivity solutions that enable the proliferation of data in automobiles consumer devices pcs and other applications 

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on the embedded control market which includes microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices connectivity devices interface devices serial eeproms superflash memory products our patented keeloq ®  security devices and flash ip solutions we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers we license superflash technology to foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication wafer probe and assembly and test the ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing increased due to our acquisition of smsc which outsourced all of its manufacturing 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products flaship systems new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes junior subordinated convertible debentures and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

  

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2013 we had approximately 2018 million of deferred revenue and 628 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1390 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2012 we had approximately 1591 million of deferred revenue and 504 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1087 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 701 million at march 31 2013 and 517 million at march 31 2012 on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

  

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

  

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the measurement of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets and acquired investments in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments acquired also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activity by the investees the investees capital structure and the terms of the investees issued interests 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2013 was 580 million of which 498 million was reflected in operating expenses total sharebased compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal 2013 was 82 million total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 46 million at march 31 2013 

  

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans option pricing models including the blackscholes model require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is most reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts we estimate the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after april 1 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2013 was immaterial 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 

12month demand estimates for projected 12month demand are generally based on the average shipments of the prior threemonth period which are then annualized to adjust for any potential seasonality in our business the estimated 12month demand is compared to our most recently developed sales forecast to further reconcile the 12month demand estimate management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations for example demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand alternatively demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued 

  

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs approximately 317 million and 67 million was charged directly to cost of sales in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively there were no such charges in fiscal 2011 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized at march 31 2013 the valuation allowances totaled 886 million and relate to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards capital losses foreign tax credits and state tax credits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2013 our deferred tax asset was 807 million 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and smsc is currently under irs audit for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain appropriate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

junior subordinated convertible debentures 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our junior subordinated convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion price per share which was 2678 at march 31 2013 and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are not generally determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

results of continuing operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of flash intellectual property we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of markets perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

  

our net sales of 15816   million in fiscal 2013 increased by 1984 million or 144 over fiscal 2012 and our net sales of 13832 million in fiscal 2012 decreased by 1040 million or 70 from fiscal 2011 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 was due primarily to our acquisition of smsc on august 2 2012 offset in part by adverse general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 was due primarily to weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions average selling prices for our semiconductor products were up approximately 5 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 and were essentially flat in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was up approximately 10 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 and down approximately 8 in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the increase in the number of units of our semiconductor products sold and our average selling prices in fiscal 2013 was a result of our acquisition of smsc the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were as follows dollars in thousands 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 655 of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 671 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 and 682 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 115 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and decreased approximately 84 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from our acquisition of smsc and market share gains which offset weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets that we serve including the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from changes in general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets that we serve 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products 

  

sales of our analog interface and mixed signal products accounted for approximately 194 of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 124 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 120 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 

  

net sales of our analog interface and mixed signal products increased approximately 798 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and decreased approximately 38 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc and market share gains achieved within the analog interface and mixed signal market the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions which offset market share gains achieved within the analog interface and mixed signal market 

  

analog interface and mixed signal products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than 80 of our analog interface and mixed signal product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog interface and mixed signal business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog interface and mixed signal products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog interface and mixed signal products will increase over time 

  

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 90 of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 130 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 149 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 

  

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 205 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and decreased approximately 190 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the decreases in memory product net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 were driven primarily by adverse customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets and weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

  

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with technology licensed for the use of our superflash technology and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 53 of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 63 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 48 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 

net sales related to our technology licensing decreased approximately 37 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 and increased approximately 207 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease in technology licensing net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was due primarily to adverse semiconductor industry and global economic conditions the increase in technology licensing net sales in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by the adoption of our technology by more manufacturers of semiconductors 

  

other 

  

revenue from assembly and test subcontracting services accounted for approximately 08 of our total net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 12 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 01 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 53 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 59 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 58 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 the decrease in distributor net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to prior periods was driven primarily by our acquisition of smsc which makes a larger percentage of its net sales to oem customers rather than through distributors 

  

our largest distributor future electronics accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 14 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 no other distributor accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2013 our distributors maintained 30 days of inventory of our products compared to 31 days at march 31 2012 and 40 days at march 31 2011 over the past three fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 27 days and 47 days we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

  

net sales by geography 

  

net sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were as follows dollars in thousands 



our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 83 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 82 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 80 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market as well as acquisitions such as smsc which had a significant concentration of sales in asia our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 25 in fiscal 2011 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2013 approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 8385 million in fiscal 2013 7993 million in fiscal 2012 and 8813 million in fiscal 2011 gross profit as a percent of sales was 530 in fiscal 2013 578 in fiscal 2012 and 593 in fiscal 2011 

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions when production levels are below normal capacity we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity our wafer fabrication facilities operated below normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment during fiscal 2013 and the second half of fiscal 2012 in response to weak economic conditions during fiscal 2011 and the first half of fiscal 2012 we operated at or above normal capacity levels in our wafer fabrication facilities as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs approximately 317 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2013 and approximately 67 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2012 in the 

future if production levels are below normal capacity we will charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity similar to our wafer fabs during fiscal 2013 and the second half of fiscal 2012 we operated at levels below the total operating capacity of our thailand assembly and test facility due to adverse business conditions and these actions had a negative impact on our gross margins during the first half of fiscal 2012 and all of fiscal 2011 we operated at normal levels of capacity at our thailand assembly and test facility and we selectively increased our assembly and test capacity at such facility during such time 

  

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 022 to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

our overall inventory levels were 2423 million at march 31 2013 compared to 2173 million at march 31 2012 and 1808 million at march 31 2011 we maintained 116 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2013 compared to 138 days of inventory at march 31 2012 and 108 days at march 31 2011 we expect our inventory levels in the june 2013 quarter to increase modestly from the march 2013 levels due to projected higher wafer purchases from thirdparty foundries we believe our existing level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers and allow us to keep our fiscal 2014 capital expenditures at relatively low levels 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog interface and mixed signal products memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 56 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 67 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and approximately 61 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry and our internal capacity capabilities thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 84 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities compared to approximately 95 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and approximately 88 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process smsc had historically outsourced the majority of its assembly and test activities we plan to bring some of smscs assembly and test activities into our thailand facilities over time 

  

we have in recent years outsourced a larger portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities as a result of our acquisitions of smsc in august 2012 and silicon storage technology sst in april 2010 we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2013 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 33 and 38 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2013 were 2547 million or 161 of sales compared to 1827 million or 132 of sales for fiscal 2012 and 1706 million or 115 of sales for fiscal 2011 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 721 million or 395 for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc and higher 

headcount costs rd expenses increased 121 million or 71 for fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 were an increased number of employees driving higher employee costs and higher discretionary expenses offset by lower bonus costs 

in the june 2013 quarter we expect rd expenses to be relatively flat with the march 2013 quarter and for such expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales due to operational efficiencies and continued synergies of integrating our acquisition of smsc 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 were 2615   million or 165 of sales compared to 2083 million or 151 of sales for fiscal 2012 and 2222 million or 149 of sales for fiscal 2011 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 532 million or 255 for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the primary reason for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 were additional costs from our acquisition of smsc selling general and administrative expenses decreased 139   million or 62 for fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the primary reasons for the dollar decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 were lower bonus costs 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

special charges 

  

acquisition related expenses 

  

during fiscal 2013 we incurred special charges of 322 million comprised of a 44 million net increase in the fair value of contingent consideration related to one of our acquisitions 163 million of primarily severancerelated costs in addition to office closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of smsc and legal settlement costs of approximately 115 million for certain legal matters related to sst which we acquired in april 2010 in excess of previously accrued amounts during fiscal 2012 special charges included a benefit of 07 million comprised of a 10 million favorable adjustment to contingent consideration offset by 03 million of severancerelated charges related to a prior year acquisition during fiscal 2011 we incurred 19 million of severancerelated and office closure costs associated with our acquisition of sst 

  

patent licenses 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we agreed to the terms of a patent license with an unrelated third party and signed an agreement on march 20 2012 the patent license settled alleged infringement claims the total payment made to the thirdparty in march 2012 was 28 million 15 million of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the remaining 13 million was recorded as a prepaid royalty which will be amortized over the remaining life of the patents which expire in december 2018 

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2013 decreased to 156 million from 180 million in fiscal 2012 and from 160 million in fiscal 2011 the primary reasons for the decrease in interest income for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 relates to lower yields on shortterm cash investments and lower invested cash balances the primary reasons for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 relates to the redemption of a previously written down auction rate security at par value and higher invested cash balances interest expense in fiscal 2013 was 409 million compared to 343 million in fiscal 2012 and 315 million in fiscal 2011 the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 relates to increased borrowings under our credit facility to partially finance our acquisition of smsc other expense net in fiscal 2013 was 04 million compared to other expense net of 04 million in fiscal 2012 and other income net of 19 million in fiscal 2011 the change in other expense income net during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily relates to 13 million of losses on equity securities during fiscal 2012 compared to 24 million of gains on equity securities during fiscal 2011 these losses and 

gains were a result of impairment charges due to market fluctuations in the value of certain investments in publicly traded companies as well as dividends received and losses and gains recognized on the sale of these equity securities 

provision for income taxes 

  

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 163 in fiscal 2013 113 in fiscal 2012 and 68 in fiscal 2011 excluding onetime tax events described below our effective tax rates were lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates changes in tax regulations and the rd tax credit during fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate was higher due to 272 million of onetime foreign and domestic tax implications from our acquisition of smsc which offset an 81 million benefit received from the reinstatement of the rd credit and 97 million of other nonrecurring tax events including releases of previously established tax reserves related to audit closures and expirations of statutes of limitations and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities these items increased our effective tax rate from continuing operations by 62 to an effective tax rate of 163 during fiscal 2012 we completed a project that led to additional rd tax credit claims in the amount of 41 million which reduced our effective tax rate by 11 to 113 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 includes a 244 million benefit related to various items including a settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008 tax audits the expiration of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and a charge related to a corporate restructuring this benefit reduced our effective tax rate from continuing operations by 54 percentage points to an effective tax rate of 68 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and smsc is under audit for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future and any expiration of our tax holidays in thailand are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

results of discontinued operations 

  

as a result of our acquisition of sst certain of ssts product lines were marketed for sale based on managements decision regarding them not being a strategic fit into our product portfolio the discontinued businesses include various memory product lines for financial statement purposes the net assets and results of operations for these discontinued businesses have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and assets held for sale on may 21 2010 we completed a transaction to sell one of the businesses acquired from sst to greenliant systems ltd the sale price in this transaction was determined by management to represent fair value and accordingly no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of the net assets in this sale we disposed of approximately 236 million of assets held for sale primarily comprised of inventory property plant and equipment intangible assets and nonmarketable securities consideration in the transaction was in the form of cash and notes receivable from greenliant systems ltd on july 8 2010 we granted an exclusive limited license for certain serial norflash products to professional computer technology ltd pct the license is limited to certain industry segments and geographic regions and excludes certain multinational customers pct has no license to sell these products to any other industry segment or geographic region other than as set forth in our agreement with them 

the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 was 102 million or 005 per diluted share contributing to the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 was 94 million of inventory writedowns related to discontinued operations there were no assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 or march 31 2012 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 18360 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2013 an increase of 485 million from the march 31 2012 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities being offset by dividend payments of 2738 million and cash used for our acquisitions net of proceeds received from our line of credit of 1323 million 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 4462 million for fiscal 2013 3965 million for fiscal 2012 and 5827 million for fiscal 2011 the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities and lower net income in fiscal 2012 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 9368 million for fiscal 2013 2565 million for fiscal 2012 and 1879 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to 7317 million of cash consideration net of 1809 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired used for our acquisition of smsc the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in cash related to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments which offset lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 508 million in fiscal 2013 624 million in fiscal 2012 and 1245 million in fiscal 2011 the lower capital expenditure activity in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by decreased production requirements as a result of uncertain economic conditions capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 80 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

net cash provided by financing activities was 3822 million for fiscal 2013 net cash used in financing activities was 2081   million for fiscal 2012 and 1830 million for fiscal 2011 we received cash proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement of 6200 million during fiscal 2013 which was used to partially finance our acquisition of smsc we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of 2738 million in fiscal 2013 2662 million in fiscal 2012 and 2568 million in fiscal 2011 proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were 357 million for fiscal 2013 575 million for fiscal 2012 and 719 million for fiscal 2011 

on august 12 2011 we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders the credit agreement provides for a 750 million revolving credit facility with a 100 million foreign currency sublimit a 25 million letter of credit sublimit and a 15 million swingline loan sublimit terminating on august 12 2016 the credit agreement also contains an increase option permitting us subject to certain requirements to arrange with existing lenders andor new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of 250 million in additional commitments which may be for revolving loans or term loans proceeds of loans made under the credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes at march 31 2013 6200 million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the credit agreement 

on august 2 2012 we closed our acquisition of smsc and smsc became a wholly owned subsidiary of microchip upon the closing of the acquisition each share of common stock of smsc was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive 3700 in cash without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes we financed the transaction using approximately 3127 million of our existing balance of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and borrowings of approximately 6000 million under our existing credit agreement at august 2 2012 smsc had approximately 2052 million of cash cash equivalents and longterm investments on its balance sheet 

our total cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was 17820 million at march 31 2013  and 13811 million at march 31 2012 under current tax laws and regulations if accumulated earnings and profits held by our foreign subsidiaries that us taxes had not previously been provided for were to be distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes and 

foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and longterm investments available for our us operations as of march 31 2013  and march 31 2012 was approximately 1000 million and 4065 million respectively we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies with the objective of having our worldwide cash available in the locations in which it is needed we believe our offshore earnings are permanently reinvested offshore however there can be no assurance that we will not determine to repatriate some of our offshore earnings in future periods to fund stockholder dividends share repurchases acquisitions or other corporate activities in the future we expect that a significant portion of our future cash generation will be in our foreign subsidiaries 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2013 we had 60 million in notional amount of foreign currencyforward contracts outstanding 

on december 11 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2013 we had repurchased 75 million shares under this 10 million share authorization for a total of 2347 million there is no expiration date associated with this program the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon market conditions interest rates and corporate considerations 

  

as of march 31 2013 we held approximately 223 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 195 billion during fiscal 2013 we paid dividends in the amount of 1406 per share for a total dividend payment of 2738 million during fiscal 2012 we paid dividends in the amount of 1390 per share for a total dividend payment of 2662 million during fiscal 2011 we paid dividends in the amount of 1374 per share for a total dividend payment of 2568 million on may 2 2013 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 03535 per share which will be paid on june 4 2013 to stockholders of record on may 21 2013 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 696 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may further borrow under our credit agreement expand our credit agreement or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to increase our level of domestic cash to fund dividends share repurchases or acquisitions or to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including our level of dividend payments changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2013 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2013 dollars in thousands 













purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services with the exception of commitments to our wafer foundries are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of march 31 2013 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in february 2013 the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance to clarify the reclassification requirements from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income this amendment requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount is reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to 

the related note on the face of the financial statements for additional information these amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2012 which for us is the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 these changes are required to be applied prospectively we do not anticipate that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our investments are intended to establish a highquality portfolio that preserves principal meets liquidity needs avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities money market funds cash deposits and marketable securities that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 18360   million as of march 31 2013 compared to 17876 million as of march 31 2012 the availableforsale debt securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 



at march 31 2013 338 million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars with the continuing liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions and are not liquid while we continue to earn interest on these investments based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices the estimated market value for a portion of these ars no longer approximates the original purchase value 

the fair value of the failed ars of 338 million has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions we evaluated the impairments in the value of these ars determining our intent to sell these securities prior to the recovery of our amortized cost basis which resulted in some of the securities being otherthantemporarily impaired and recognized impairment charges on these investments of 04 million in fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2012 we recognized a 03 million gain on our ars positions as a gain on redemption at par value of one ars position offset impairment charges recognized during the year if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

  

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms flash memory and various analog and interface products 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market at approximately 15 billion in calendar year 2011 microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures 4bit microcontrollers are the smallest segment of the microcontroller market and have been in decline for several years 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of highvolume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent a significant portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications 

  

our products 

  

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

  

 

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power wide voltage range operation mixed signal integration and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

  

microcontrollers 

  

we offer a broad family of proprietary microcontroller products marketed under the pic brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 10 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our pic products are designed for applications requiring field programmability high performance low power and cost effectiveness our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set computer referred to as risc and variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative singlebus complex instruction set computer architectures referred to as cisc with close to 900 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontroller markets 

  

digital signal controllers dsc are a subset of our 16bit microcontroller offering our dspic   dsc families integrate the control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of digital signal processors dsps along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic dscs expand our addressable market 

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our small footprint flexible extreme low power lowcost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

  

development tools 

  

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic dsc for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

  

our family of development tools for pic and dspic products range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation capability customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our pic and dspic development tools share the same integrated development environment 

  

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are approximately 200 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

  

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped almost 13 million development tools 

  

analog and interface products 

  

our analog and interface products consist of several families with approximately 800 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management rf linear drivers safety and security and interface products at the end of fiscal 2012 our mixedsignal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 18500 end customers 

  

we market and sell our analog and interface products into our microcontroller customer base to customers who use microcontrollers from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

  

memory products 

  

our memory products consist of serial electrically erasable programmable readonly memory referred to as serial eeproms serial flash memories parallel flash memories and serial sram memories serial eeproms serial flash memories and serial sram have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small footprint devices we sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

  

technology licensing 

  

our technology licensing business includes license fees and royalties associated with technology licenses for the use of our superflash technology and fees for engineering services we license our superflash ®  technology to foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products gate array rf and analog products that require embedded flash 

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

 

wafer fabrication 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 to 50 microns during the first half of fiscal 2012 fab 2 operated at or above normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be in the range of 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment during the second half of fiscal 2012 due to weak economic and semiconductor industry conditions fab 2 operated slightly below normal capacity levels fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies was increased during fiscal 2012 by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment as required 

  

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 022 to 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns similar to fab 2 fab 4 was operating at or above normal capacity levels during the first half of fiscal 2012 and slightly below normal capacity levels during the second half of fiscal 2012 the capacity of fab 4 increased during fiscal 2012 to support our most advanced technology and support new technology development the capacity increase was completed by starting up more of the tools we acquired when we purchased fab 4 in fiscal 2003 and installing new tools a significant amount of additional clean room capacity and equipment acquired with fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we have in recent years outsourced a portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities as a result of our acquisition of sst in fiscal 2011 we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2012 approximately 20 of our sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries 

  

wafer probe assembly and test 

  

we perform wafer probe product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand we also perform a limited amount of wafer probe at our chandler arizona facility as of march 31 2012 approximately 67 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facilities as of march 31 2012 approximately 95 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facilities we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements during the first half of fiscal 2012 we operated at normal capacity levels and selectively increased our probe assembly and test capacity at our thailand facilities during the second half of fiscal 2012 due to weak economic and semiconductor industry conditions we operated at levels below the total operating capacity of our thailand facilities 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller analog and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic analog and memory product lines we use a common process technology for our microcontroller analog and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

  

at the end of fiscal 2012 we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3143 million and 2023 million in other countries including 1861 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2011 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the us with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3300 million and 2105 million in other countries including 1937 million in thailand 

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of microcontrollers digital signal controllers serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies rf products analog and interface products development systems user interface products software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2012 our rd expenses were 1827   million compared to 1706   million in fiscal 2011 and 1208 million in fiscal 2010 rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of 147   million in fiscal 2012 129 million in fiscal 2011 and 122 million in fiscal 2010 

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

  

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize us for our products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

in fiscal 2012 we derived 59 of our net sales through distributors and 41 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2011 we derived 58 of our net sales through distributors and 42 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us in fiscal 2010 we derived 61 of our net sales through distributors and 39 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by us our largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were as follows dollars in thousands 



sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 82 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 80 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 77 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 

our  international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our  revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however in recent periods changes in global economic and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2012 our backlog was approximately 3288 million compared to 5449 million as of april 30 2011 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

  

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china korea and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2012 and 2030 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful intellectual 

property protection or any commercial advantage to us pursuing violations of our intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex business area involving patent law trademark law copyright law and the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

  

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use discharge and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the storage or use of or to adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of march 31 2012 we had 6923 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

  

our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 11 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock adverse global economic conditions the subsequent economic recovery and recent economic uncertainty have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 we reduced wafer starts in both fab 2 and fab 4 implemented rotating unpaid time off and had multiple planned shutdowns in our thailand facility to help control inventory levels in response to adverse economic conditions this lower capacity utilization resulted in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins from the march 2010 quarter through the september 2011 quarter we were running at more optimal levels of capacity utilization however in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we reduced wafer starts to control inventory balances in response to a slowdown in global economic conditions we continued with the reduced level of wafer starts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 these recent actions had a negative impact on our gross margins 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will likely suffer 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our memory and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory and nonproprietary analog products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 59 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 58 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 our largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

any future adverse conditions in the us or global economies or in the us or global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry or economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

in connection with our acquisition of sst in april 2010 we acquired ssts intellectual property licensing business which is based on its superflash technology the success of our licensing business will depend on the continued market acceptance of this technology and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technology and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

because our superflash technology is complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technology there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

we are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our superflash technology also rely on foundries and other contractors 

we use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operational or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption further procurement of required products and services from third parties is done by purchase order and contracts if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products 

in a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs or a decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

certain of our superflash technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if the licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from the wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business is subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business in recent periods and changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and have made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers or licensees from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against us or the customers or licensees by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected end customer system issues due to the interaction with our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 15 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell our expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or interactions with our products cause the system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had approximately 74000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 8 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 

further as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale for example under these contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for claims of intellectual property infringement if we agree to special supply terms and we become unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityrelated issues if we agree to special warranty or indemnification provisions we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to limit the number of contracts that we sign which contain such special provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure such provisions do expose us to significant additional risks and could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

business interruptions to our operations or the operations of our key vendors subcontractors licensees or customers whether due to natural disasters or other events could harm our business 

operations at any of our facilities at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors or at any of our significant vendors or customers may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control these reasons may include work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure radioactive contamination fire earthquake floods volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

in particular thailand has experienced periods of severe flooding in recent years however our facilities in thailand have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers although we maintain business interruption insurance such insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

additionally as described above operations at our customers and licensees may be disrupted for a number of reasons in the event of customer disruptions sales of our products may decline and our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer likewise if our licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption our royalty revenue may decline as our licenses are based on per unit royalties 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2012 approximately 82 of our net sales were made to foreign customers during fiscal 2011 approximately 80 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past from time to time thailand has also experienced periods of severe flooding however our facilities have continued to operate normally there can be no assurance that any future flooding in thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations we use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our operating results    

we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar 

transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar such as past declines in the euro relative to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches facility issues or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results such network disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or partner customer or employee personal data any loss of such information could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches from time to time we have experienced verifiable attacks on our data by unauthorized parties however such attacks have not resulted in any material damage to us in recent years we have implemented improvements to our protective measures which are not limited to the following firewalls antivirus patches log monitors routine backups with offsite retention of storage media system audits data partitioning and routine password 

modifications there can be no assurance that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber attack or disruptions and any such attack or disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results 

thirdparty service providers such as foundries assembly and test contractors distributors credit card processors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data in the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard our data that they hold security breaches and loss of our data could result any such loss of data by our thirdparty service providers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we have determined that it is more cost effective to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses over the past several years there has been an expansion in environmental laws focusing on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products the european union and countries such as the us china korea and brazil have enacted or may enact such laws or regulations these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture and sell our products in addition over the last several years the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packaging materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold inventory that is not saleable as a result of changes to regulations we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of hazardous substances in our products and energy efficiency measures 

customer demands and new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requires the sec to establish new disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties when these new requirements are implemented they could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products and there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we may implement we may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it cannot be sold 

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business 

new climate change regulations could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment it is possible that new permits will be required for our current or any expansion of our operations failure to receive timely permits could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or cessation of operations at one or more facilities in addition new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages or higher costs for water or energy to control the temperature inside of our facilities also certain of our operations are located in tropical regions such as thailand some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms severe floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or local government that we have failed to comply with these or other export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and earnings further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2009 and later we are currently being audited by the irs for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2005 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures including our recently announced agreement to acquire smsc 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses in this regard in may 2012 we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire smsc a publicly traded semiconductor company the integration process for our acquisitions including our acquisition of smsc may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and it may be difficult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies we may be subject to claims by terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional stockbased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash raising debt issuing shares of common stock or other mechanisms 

while the risks above may be relevant to all of our acquisitions our recently announced acquisition of smsc when completed will be a larger and more complex transaction than our other recent transactions and exposes us to greater risks and liabilities than we have encountered in the past 

further when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors or other third parties and such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions 

based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill or longlived asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2012 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our current or future debt 

as a result of our sale of 115 billion of principal value 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures in december 2007 we have a substantially greater amount of longterm debt than we have maintained in the past in august 2011 we entered into a 750 million revolving credit agreement although we have not yet borrowed under such credit agreement we expect to borrow a significant amount under such agreement in connection with the closing of our acquisition of smsc later this year our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our debentures or any other future indebtedness and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective 

potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in recent years there have been a number of initiatives proposed by the obama administration and members of congress regarding the tax treatment of such undistributed earnings if adopted 

certain of these initiatives would substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the us changes in tax law such as these proposals could have a material negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

the value of our investments in marketable equity investments could change materially 

our investments in availableforsale marketable securities at march 31 2012 consist of shares of public company common stock the value of which is determined by the closing price of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of our balance sheet date the market value of these investments was approximately 53 million at march 31 2012 the stock prices of these securities could materially decrease due to company performance or marketrelated activity negatively affecting the value of these investments if we wanted to liquidate these investments at a time in which the stock prices had decreased from current levels our realized return would be materially and adversely affected depending on the number of shares we desire to sell relative to the daily trading volume in the shares in the event we desire to sell our marketable securities it may take several weeks or months to dispose of our position and our efforts to sell could drive down the price of the shares we are selling 

we may not realize a return on our nonmarketable equity investments 

at march 31 2012 we had investments of 77 million in several privately held companies including those that we acquired as a result of our acquisition of sst these companies range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue and business models many factors are critical to the success of these companies including product and technology development market acceptance of their products and technology and achievement of financial and operational efficiencies if any of these private companies are unsuccessful as a result of these or other factors we could lose all or part of our investment in that company also if we determine that an otherthantemporary impairment to fair value exists in any of our nonmarketable equity investments we will need to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related impairment charge 

additionally we may desire to dispose of one or more of these nonmarketable equity investments from time to time however our investments in these private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of the investments to our advantage or even at all also for investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting the income or loss we are required to share from the investees income or loss could affect our earnings gains or losses from equity securities could vary from our expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities gains or losses from equity method investments and impairment charges 

credit conditions have adversely impacted our holdings of auction rate securities 

at march 31 2012 102   million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars historically the carrying value of ars approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates with the continuing liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions as a result we will not be able to access such funds until a future auction on these investments is successful 

our ars have experienced multiple rating downgrades by the major rating agencies the fair value of these ars has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions based on the estimated values we concluded these investments were other than temporarily impaired and have recognized impairment charges on these investments in prior periods in fiscal 2012 we recognized a 03 million gain on our ars positions as a gain on redemption at par value of one ars position offset impairment charges recognized during the year we recognized impairment charges of 16 million in fiscal 2011 if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings 

the majority of our short and longterm investments are in highly rated government agency bonds and corporate bonds other than with respect to our holdings of ars we have not experienced any liquidity or impairment issues with such investments however there can be no assurance that credit market conditions will not in the future adversely affect the liquidity or value of our investments in government agency bonds or corporate bonds

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 –  business item 6 –  selected financial data and item 8 –  financial statements and supplementary data 

  

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of our overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 34 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

strategy 

  

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices interface devices serial eeproms and our patented keeloq ®  security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers with our acquisition of sst in april 2010 we added flaship solutions and superflash memory products to our strategic focus we license superflash technology to foundries integrated device manufacturers and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products 

  

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to 

achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin we do outsource a portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products flaship systems new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes junior subordinated convertible debentures and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling 

price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

  

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2012 we had approximately 1591 million of deferred revenue and 504 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1087 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2011 we had approximately 2081 million of deferred revenue and 681 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1400 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

  

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 517 million at march 31 2012 and 719 million at march 31 2011 on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be canceled by us at any time 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

  

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on 

shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

  

business combinations 

  

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the measurement of fair value of assets accrued and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets and acquired investments in privately held companies in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments acquired also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activity by the investees the investees capital structure and the terms of the investees issued interests 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2012 was 383 million of which 327 million was reflected in operating expenses total sharebased compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal 2012 was 56 million total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 46 million at march 31 2012 

  

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans option pricing models including the blackscholes model require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is most reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts we estimate the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after april 1 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2012 was immaterial 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are 

less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later 

suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

  

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs approximately 67 million and 223 million was charged directly to cost of sales in fiscal 2012 and 2010 respectively there were no such charges in fiscal 2011 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized at march 31 2012 the valuation allowances totaled 785 million and consists of state net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and state tax credits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2012 our gross deferred tax asset was 912 million 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years 2009 and 2010 fiscal years 2011 and 2012 are open for examination by tax authorities we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain appropriate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

junior subordinated convertible debentures 

  

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our junior subordinated convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income additionally certain embedded features of the debentures qualify as derivatives and are bundled as a compound embedded derivative that is measured at fair value lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion price per share which was 2794 at march 31 2012 and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are not generally determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

results of continuing operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 



net sales 

  

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of flash intellectual property we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be typically provided by letters of credit 

  

our net sales of 13832   million in fiscal 2012 decreased by 1040 million or 70 over fiscal 2011 and our net sales of 14872 million in fiscal 2011 increased by 5395 million or 569 over fiscal 2010 the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 was due primarily to weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the increase in net sales in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 was due primarily to improving semiconductor industry conditions market share gains in our microcontroller and analog product lines and an increase in net sales due to our acquisition of sst average selling prices for our semiconductor products were essentially flat in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 and were down approximately 1 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was down approximately 8 in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 and up approximately 54 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows dollars in thousands 



microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 671 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 682 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 and 810 of our total net sales in fiscal 2010 the primary reason for the decrease in our microcontroller net sales as a percentage of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was our acquisition of sst which resulted in an increase in our memory product and technology licensing sales 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products decreased approximately 84 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and increased approximately 321 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and the increase in net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from changes in general economic and semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets that we serve including the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets as well as market share gains 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 130 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 149 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 85 of our total net sales in fiscal 2010 the primary reason for the increase in our memory product net sales as a percentage of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year was our acquisition of sst’s superflash memory products 

  

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 190 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and increased approximately 176 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 excluding our sst memory product sales our memory product sales increased approximately 200 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in memory product net sales in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by adverse customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets and weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions the increase in memory product net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was driven primarily by increased revenue due to our acquisition of sst improving semiconductor industry conditions and by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets 

  

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

analog and interface products 

  

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 124 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 120 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 105 of our total net sales in fiscal 2010 

  

net sales of our analog and interface products decreased approximately 38 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and increased approximately 783 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven primarily by weak general economic and semiconductor industry conditions which offset market share gains achieved within the analog and interface market the increase in net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was driven primarily by improving semiconductor industry conditions market share gains achieved within the analog and interface market and increased revenue due to our acquisition of sst 

  

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than 70 of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing 

stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products will increase over time 

  

technology licensing 

  

technology licensing revenue includes a combination of royalties associated with technology licensed for the use of our superflash technology and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 63 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 48 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 technology licensing revenue is the result of our acquisition of sst in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 

net sales related to our technology licensing increased approximately 207 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 driven primarily by the adoption of our technology by more manufacturers of semiconductors 

  

revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time due to general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 

  

other 

  

revenue from assembly and test subcontracting services accounted for approximately 12 of our total net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 01 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 our assembly and test subcontractors services are a result of our acquisition of millennium microtech thailand mmt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for approximately 59 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 58 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 61 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 

  

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 and approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 and approximately 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2012 our distributors maintained 31 days of inventory of our products compared to 40 days at march 31 2011 and 41 days at march 31 2010 over the past three fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 31 days and 46 days we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows dollars in thousands 



our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 82 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 80 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 77 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 25 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2011 and 2010 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal 2012 approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 7924 million in fiscal 2012 8744 million in fiscal 2011 and 5342 million in fiscal 2010 gross profit as a percent of sales was 573 in fiscal 2012 588 in fiscal 2011 and 564 in fiscal 2010 

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were 

  

 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

 

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions our wafer fabrication facilities operated at or above normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment during the second half of fiscal 2010 through the first half of fiscal 2012 however during the first half of fiscal 2010 and the second half of fiscal 2012 we operated below normal capacity levels in our wafer fabrication facilities in response to weaker economic conditions as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs approximately 67 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2012 and approximately 223 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2010 there were no such charges in fiscal 2011 in the future if production levels are below normal capacity we will charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity during the first half of fiscal 2010 and the second half of fiscal 2012 we operated at levels below the total operating capacity of our thailand facility due to adverse business conditions and these actions had a negative impact on our gross margins during the second half of fiscal 2010 through the first half of fiscal 2012 we operated at normal levels of capacity at our thailand facility and we selectively increased our assembly and test capacity at such facility 

  

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 022 to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

our overall inventory levels were 2173 million at march 31 2012 compared to 1808 million at march 31 2011 and 1166 million at march 31 2010 we maintained 137 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2011 compared to 107 days of inventory at march 31 2011 and 97 days at march 31 2010 we expect our inventory levels in the june 2012 quarter to be about flat to the levels at march 31 2012 we believe this level of inventory will allow us to maintain competitive lead times and provide strong delivery performance to our customers and allow us to keep our fiscal 2013 capital expenditures at low levels 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

  

at march 31 2012 approximately 67 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 61 at march 31 2011 and approximately 65 at march 31 2010 the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry and our internal capacity capabilities thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations at march 31 2012 approximately 95 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 88 in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2010 substantially all of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process the primary reason for the decrease in the portion of assembly and test operations performed in our thailand facility in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to our acquisition of sst which had outsourced 100 of its assembly and test operations prior to being acquired by microchip we plan to continue to bring a portion of ssts assembly and test volume into our thailand facilities over time 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements as a result of our acquisition of sst in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we have become more reliant on outside foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2012 approximately 20   of our total net sales related to products which were purchased from outside wafer foundries 

  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2012 were 1827 million or 132 of sales compared to 1706 million or 115 of sales for fiscal 2011 and 1208 million or 128 of sales for fiscal 2010 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 121 million or 71 for fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 were an increased number of employees driving higher employee costs and higher discretionary expenses offset by lower bonus costs rd expenses increased 498 million or 412 for fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 were higher salary and bonus costs and additional costs from our acquisition of sst 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 were 2124   million or 153 of sales compared to 2278 million or 153 of sales for fiscal 2011 and 1672 million or 177 of sales for fiscal 2010 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 154   million or 68 for fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the primary reasons for the dollar decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 were 

lower bonus costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 606   million or 362 for fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 were higher salary and bonus costs and additional costs from our acquisition of sst 

  

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

special charges 

  

acquisition related expenses 

  

during fiscal 2012 special charges included a benefit of 07 million comprised of a 10 million favorable adjustment to contingent consideration offset by 03 million of severancerelated charges related to a prior year acquisition during fiscal 2011 we incurred 19 million of severancerelated and office closure costs associated with our acquisition of sst 

  

patent licenses 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we agreed to the terms of a patent license with an unrelated third party and signed an agreement on march 20 2012 the patent license settled alleged infringement claims the total payment made to the thirdparty in march 2012 was 28 million 15 million of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and the remaining 13 million was recorded as a prepaid royalty which will be amortized over the remaining life of the patents which expire in december 2018 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we agreed to the terms of a patent license with an unrelated third party and signed an agreement on july 9 2009 the patent license settled alleged infringement claims the total payment made to the thirdparty in july 2009 was 14 million 12 million of which was expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the remaining 02 million was recorded as a prepaid royalty that was amortized over the remaining life of the patents which expired in june 2010 

  

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2012 increased to 180 million from 160 million in fiscal 2011 and from 153 million in fiscal 2010 the primary reasons for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 relates to the redemption of a previously written down auction rate security at par value and higher invested cash balances the primary reason for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 was a higher rate of return realized on certain of our investments interest expense in fiscal 2012 was 343 million compared to 315 million in fiscal 2011 and 312 million in fiscal 2010 the primary reasons for the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 were 17 million related to our credit facility and 07 million of additional noncash interest expense on our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures other expense net in fiscal 2012 was 04 million compared to other income net of 19 million in fiscal 2011 and other income net of 87 million in fiscal 2010 the change in other expense income net during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily relates to 13 million of losses on equity securities during fiscal 2012 compared to 24 million of gains on equity securities during fiscal 2011 these losses and gains were a result of impairment charges due to market fluctuations in the value of certain investments in publicly traded companies as well as dividends received and losses and gains recognized on the sale of these equity securities the decrease in other income net during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily relates to 75 million of gains on trading securities during fiscal 2010 these gains were a result of market fluctuations in the value of certain strategic investments in publicly traded companies which we classified as trading securities 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 113 in fiscal 2012 68 in fiscal 2011 and 88 in fiscal 2010 excluding onetime tax events described below our effective tax rate is lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates changes in tax regulations and the rd tax credit during fiscal 2012 we completed a project that led to additional rd tax credit claims in the amount of 41 million which reduced our effective tax rate by 11 to 113 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 includes a 244 million benefit related to various items including a settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008 tax audits the expiration of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and a charge related to a corporate restructuring this benefit reduced our effective tax rate from continuing operations by 54 percentage points to an effective tax rate of 68 our effective tax rate in 

fiscal 2010 includes a 85 million us tax benefit related to our settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004 tax audits this benefit reduced our effective tax rate by 36 percentage points to an effective tax rate of 88 

  

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years 2009 and 2010 fiscal years 2011 and 2012 are open for examination by tax authorities we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future and any expiration of our tax holidays in thailand are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

results of discontinued operations 

  

as a result of our acquisition of sst certain of ssts product lines were marketed for sale based on managements decision regarding them not being a strategic fit into our product portfolio the discontinued businesses include various memory product lines for financial statement purposes the net assets and results of operations for these discontinued businesses have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and assets held for sale on may 21 2010 we completed a transaction to sell one of the businesses acquired from sst to greenliant systems ltd the sale price in this transaction was determined by management to represent fair value and accordingly no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of the net assets in this sale we disposed of approximately 236 million of assets held for sale primarily comprised of inventory property plant and equipment intangible assets and nonmarketable securities consideration in the transaction was in the form of cash and notes receivable from greenliant systems ltd on july 8 2010 we granted an exclusive limited license for certain serial norflash products to professional computer technology ltd pct the license is limited to certain industry segments and geographic regions and excludes certain multinational customers pct has no license to sell these products to any other industry segment or geographic region other than as set forth in our agreement with them 

the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 was 102 million or 005 per diluted share contributing to the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 was 94 million of inventory writedowns related to discontinued operations there were no assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 or march 31 2011 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 17876 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2012 an increase of 793 million from the march 31 2011 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities being offset by dividend payments of 2662 million during fiscal 2012 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 3965 million for fiscal 2012 5827 million for fiscal 2011 and 4520 million for fiscal 2010 the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities and lower net income in fiscal 2012 the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher net income in fiscal 2011 partially offset by fiscal 2010 proceeds of 870 million of trading securities which were sold during that year 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 2565 million for fiscal 2012 1879 million for fiscal 2011 and 1953 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in cash related to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments which offset lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in cash related to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments being partially offset by cash used to acquire sst and higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 624 million in fiscal 2012 1245 million in fiscal 2011 and 476 million in fiscal 2010 the lower capital expenditure activity in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by decreased production requirements as a result of economic conditions capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 70 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

net cash used in financing activities was 2081 million for fiscal 2012 1830   million for fiscal 2011 and 2110 million for fiscal 2010 proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were 575 million for fiscal 2012 719 million for fiscal 2011 and 365 million for fiscal 2010 we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of 2662 million in fiscal 2012 2568 million in fiscal 2011 and 2496 million in fiscal 2010 

on august 12 2011 we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders the credit agreement provides for a 750 million revolving credit facility with a 100 million foreign currency sublimit a 25 million letter of credit sublimit and a 15 million swingline loan sublimit terminating on august 12 2016 the credit agreement also contains an increase option permitting us subject to certain requirements to arrange with existing lenders andor new lenders for them to provide up to an aggregate of 250 million in additional commitments which may be for revolving loans or term loans proceeds of loans made under the credit agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes no loans were made nor letters of credit issued under the credit agreement at closing and no amounts were outstanding and no letters of credit were issued at march 31 2012 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the credit agreement 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2012 we had no foreign currencyforward contracts outstanding 

on december 11 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2012 we had repurchased 75 million shares under this 10 million share authorization for a total of 2347 million there is no expiration date associated with this program the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon market conditions interest rates and corporate considerations 

  

as of march 31 2012 we held approximately 256 million shares as treasury shares 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 167 billion during fiscal 2012 we paid dividends in the amount of 1390 per share for a total dividend payment of 2662 million during fiscal 2011 we paid dividends in the amount of 1374 per share for a total dividend payment of 2568 million during fiscal 2010 we paid dividends in the amount of 1359 per share for a total dividend payment of 2496 million on may 1 2012 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 035 per share which will be paid on may 31 2012 to stockholders of record on may 17 2012 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 678 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

on may 2 2012 we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire smsc for 3700 per share in cash which represents a total equity value of about 939 million and a total enterprise value of about 766 million after excluding smscs cash and investments on its balance sheet of approximately 173 million the acquisition has been approved by our board of directors and by the smsc board of directors and is expected to close in the third quarter of calendar 2012 subject 

to approval by smsc stockholders regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions we plan to fund the acquisition purchase price using a portion of our existing balance of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and borrowings under our credit agreement 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2012 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2012 dollars in thousands 











purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of march 31 2012 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

goodwill  in september 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment the amended guidance allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is morelikelythannot that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we early adopted this pronouncement effective for our march 31 2012 impairment assessment 

comprehensive income in june 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income under the amended guidance entities have the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements entities no longer have the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of changes in stockholders equity this amendment is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 which for us is the first quarter in fiscal 2013 the adoption of this amendment will result in a change to the current presentation of comprehensive income but will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

  

fair value measurement  in may 2011 the fasb issued amendments to the existing guidance on fair value measurement the amendments are intended to create consistency between us generally accepted accounting standards and international financial reporting standards on measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including i the application of the highest and best use valuation premise concepts ii measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entitys stockholders equity and iii quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 in addition the amendments require additional disclosure for level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs these amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 which for us is our fiscal year 2013 these changes are required to be applied prospectively we do not anticipate that the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our investments are intended to establish a highquality portfolio that preserves principal meets liquidity needs avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities money market funds cash deposits and marketable securities that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 17876   million as of march 31 2012 compared to 17083 million as of march 31 2011 the availableforsale debt securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 



at march 31 2012 102 million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars historically the carrying value of ars approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates if an auction fails for amounts we have invested our investment will not be liquid with the continuing liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions while we continue to earn interest on these investments 

based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices the estimated market value for a portion of these ars no longer approximates the original purchase value 

  

the fair value of the failed ars of 102 million has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions we evaluated the impairments in the value of these ars determining our intent to sell these securities prior to the recovery of our amortized cost basis resulted in the securities being otherthantemporarily impaired in fiscal 2012 we recognized a 03 million gain on our ars positions as a gain on redemption at par value of one ars position offset impairment charges recognized during the year we recognized impairment charges of 16 million on our ars in fiscal 2011 if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings 

  

investments in marketable equity investments 

  

our availableforsale marketable equity investments at march 31 2012 consist of shares of public company common stock the value of which is determined by the closing price of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of the balance sheet date these investments are classified as marketable securities and accounted for under the provisions of asc 320 investments  debt and equity securities  the market value of these investments was approximately 53 million at march 31 2012 compared to our cost basis of approximately 59 million the value of our investments in these securities would be materially impacted if there was a significant change in the market price of the shares a hypothetical 30 favorable or unfavorable change in the stock prices compared to the stock prices at march 31 2012 would have affected the value of our investments in marketable equity securities by approximately 16 million see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our investments in these marketable securities 

  

investments in nonmarketable equity investments 

  

we have nonmarketable equity investments in several companies including those that we acquired as a result of our acquisition of sst these companies range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue and business models these companies are dependent upon successful execution of their product and technology development objectives acceptance of their products and technology in the markets they serve and achievement of financial and operational efficiencies if any of these private companies are unsuccessful in these and other related initiatives or if there are factors beyond their control in the markets which they serve their performance could be affected materially and adversely resulting in a loss of some or all of their value which would in turn require us to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment to fair value exists in such private equity or debt investments if an otherthantemporary impairment of fair value exists we will need to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related impairment charge to our income statement our nonmarketable equity investments excluding those accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 56 million as of march 31 2012 as of march 31 2012 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 21 million

industry background 

 

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms flash memory and various analog and interface products 

 

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market at approximately 15 billion in calendar year 2010 microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures 4bit microcontrollers are the smallest segment of the microcontroller market and have been in decline for several years 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of highvolume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications 

 

our products 

 

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance extreme low power low voltage operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

 

microcontrollers 

 

we offer a broad family of proprietary microcontroller products marketed under the pic brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 9 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our pic products are designed for applications requiring field programmability high performance low power and cost effectiveness they feature a variety of memory technology configurations low voltage extreme low power small footprint and ease of use our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set computer referred to as risc and variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative singlebus complex instruction set computer architectures referred to as cisc with over 790 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontroller markets 

 

digital signal controllers dsc are a subset of our 16bit microcontroller offering our dspic   dsc families integrate the control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of digital signal processors dsps along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic dscs expand our addressable market 

 

  

  

  

  

  

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced lowcost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

 

development tools 

 

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic dsc for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

 

our family of development tools for pic and dspic products range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation capability customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our pic and dspic development tools share the same integrated development environment 

 

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are approximately 200 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

 

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped more than 1000000 development tools 

 

analog and interface products 

 

our analog and interface products consist of several families with approximately 730 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management rf linear drivers safety and security and interface products at the end of fiscal 2011 our mixedsignal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 17500 end customers 

 

we market and sell our analog and interface products into our microcontroller customer base to customers who use microcontrollers from other suppliers and to customers who use other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

 

memory products 

 

our memory products consist of serial electrically erasable programmable readonly memory referred to as serial eeproms serial flash memories parallel flash memories and serial sram memories serial eeproms serial flash memories and serial sram have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small footprint devices we sell our memory products primarily into the embedded control market complementing our microcontroller offerings 

 

technology licensing 

 

our technology licensing business from our acquisition of sst includes license fees and royalties associated with ssts technology licenses for the use of superflash technology and fees for engineering services we license the superflash ® technology to foundries idms and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products 

 

manufacturing 

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

 

 

  

  

  

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

 

 

 

 

 

  

wafer fabrication 

 

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 to 50 microns during fiscal 2011 fab 2 operated at or above normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be in the range of 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment fab 2s capacity to support more advanced technologies was increased during fiscal 2011 by making process improvements upgrading existing equipment and adding equipment as required 

 

fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 022 to 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns similar to fab 2 during fiscal 2011 fab 4 was operating at or above normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be in the range of 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment the capacity of fab 4 to support our most advanced technology and support new technology development was increased during fiscal 2011 by starting up more of the tools we acquired when we purchased fab 4 in fiscal 2003 and installing new tools a significant amount of additional clean room capacity and equipment acquired with fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we have in recent years outsourced a portion of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities as a result of our acquisition of sst in fiscal 2011 we have become more reliant on outside wafer foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements than we have in past periods in fiscal 2011 approximately 20 percent of our sales came from product that was produced at outside wafer foundries 

  

assembly and test 

 

we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand as of march 31 2011 approximately 61 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2011 approximately 88 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements during fiscal 2011 consistent with favorable business conditions we operated at normal capacity levels and selectively increased our probe assembly and test capacity at our thailand facility 

 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller analog and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic analog and memory product lines we use a common process technology for our microcontroller analog and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

 

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

 

 

  

  

  

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we have historically maintained a significant workinprocess and finished goods inventory 

 

at the end of fiscal 2011 we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the united states with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3300 million and 2105 million in other countries including 1937 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2010 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the united states with a carrying value net of accumulated depreciation of 3330 million and 1600 million in other countries including 1477 million in thailand 

 

research and development rd 

 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the development of microcontrollers digital signal controllers serial eeprom memory nor flash memory embedded flash technologies rf products analog and interface products development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing design and process technologies to enable products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

 

in fiscal 2011 our rd expenses were 1706   million compared to 1208   million in fiscal 2010 and 1155 million in fiscal 2009 rd expenses included sharebased compensation expense of 129   million in fiscal 2011 122 million in fiscal 2010 and 109 million in fiscal 2009 

 

sales and distribution 

 

general 

 

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

 

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

 

our licensing division has dedicated sales technology design product test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees 

 

distribution 

 

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

 

in fiscal 2011 we derived 58 of our net sales through distributors and 42 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip in fiscal 2010 we derived 61 of our net sales through distributors and 39 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip in fiscal 2009 we derived 64 of our net sales through distributors and 36 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip our largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

 

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

 

  

  

 

sales by geography 

 

sales by geography for fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 80 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 77 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 75 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products the primary reason our sales to customers in asia increased in fiscal 2011 compared to prior periods was due to our acquisition of sst whose sales were more heavily weighted to asian customers compared to the rest of our business americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 23 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

 

our international sales are substantially all us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in recent periods global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

 

backlog 

 

as of april 30 2011 our backlog was approximately 5449 million compared to 5276 million as of april 30 2010 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a relatively short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

 

competition 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we also compete with a number of companies that we believe have copied cloned pirated or reverse engineered our proprietary product lines in such countries as china korea and taiwan we are continuing to take actions to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 

 

 

  

  

 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2011 and 2029 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful intellectual property protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition pursuing violations of our intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis is a complex business area involving patent law trademark law copyright law and the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

 

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

 

environmental regulation 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 

 

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from recently adopted environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of or to adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

 

employees 

 

as of march 31 2011 we had 6970 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend 

 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

 

our operating results were adversely impacted by global economic conditions in the second half of fiscal 2009 and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock adverse global economic conditions and the subsequent economic recovery have caused our operating results to fluctuate significantly and make comparability between periods less meaningful 

 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 we reduced wafer starts in both fab 2 and fab 4 implemented rotating unpaid time off and had multiple planned shutdowns in our thailand facility to help control inventory levels in response to adverse economic conditions this lower capacity utilization resulted in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins in the quarter ended december 31 2009 we increased our production output in our factories and did not have any shutdowns in our thailand operation and reduced the amount of rotating unpaid time off in fab 2 and fab 4 since the march 2010 quarter we have been running at more optimal levels of capacity utilization 

 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results may suffer 

 

 

  

  

 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 

 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 58 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 61 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 our largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

 

any future adverse conditions in the us and global economies or in the us and global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry andor economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

 

our recently acquired technology licensing business exposes us to various risks  

 

in connection with our acquisition of sst we acquired ssts intellectual property licensing business which is based on its superflash technology the success of our licensing business will depend on the continued market acceptance of this technology and on our ability to further develop and enhance such technology and to introduce new technologies in the future to be successful any such technology must be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees provide satisfactory yield rates address licensee and customer requirements and perform competitively the success of our technology licensing business depends on various other factors including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

because our superflash technology is complex there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technology there can be no assurance that our existing or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance our licensees may experience disruptions in production or lower than expected production levels which would adversely affect the revenue that we receive from them our technology license agreements generally include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the licensee against liability and damages including legal defense costs arising from intellectual property matters we could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related to intellectual property matters or indemnification claims any claim with our without merit could result in significant legal fees and require significant attention from our management any of the foregoing issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing business and adversely affect our future operating results 

  

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

  

we are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us and our licensees of our flash technology also rely on foundries and other contractors 

  

we use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption further procurement of required products and services from third parties is done by purchase order and contracts if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

 

  

  

 

certain of our superflash technology licensees also rely on outside wafer foundries for wafer fabrication services if the licensees were to experience any disruption in supply from the wafer foundries this would reduce the revenue we receive in our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results 

 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacement parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

 

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad fluctuations in our overall business in recent periods semiconductor industry conditions and global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and have made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers or licensees from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against ourselves or the customers or licensees by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim settle a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture performance or use of our products these claims may be due to injuries or environmental exposures related to manufacturing a products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes or unexpected end customer system issues due to the interaction with our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell our expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

 

 

  

  

 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or interactions with our products cause the system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing and new patents trademarks and copyrights that issue may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office patent offices of a foreign country or us or foreign courts which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us although we continue to vigorously and aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our endeavors 

  

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers 

 

we regularly review the financial performance of our licensees customers distributors and suppliers however any downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our licensees customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large licensee customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in us not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances higher reserves for doubtful accounts writeoffs for accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 

 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers 

 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we had over 68000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 9 of our total revenue for the year ended march 31 2011 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits 

 

further as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale for example under these contracts we may commit to supply specific quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates or agree to extend our obligations for certain liabilities such as warranties or indemnification for claims of intellectual property infringement if we agree to special supply terms and we become unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or qualityr elated issues if we agree to special warranty or indemnification provisions we may be liable for the customers costs expenses and damages associated with their claims and we may be obligated to defend the customer against claims of intellectual property infringement and pay the associated legal fees while we try to limit the number of contracts that we sign which contain such special provisions manage the risks underlying such liabilities and set caps on our liability exposure such provisions do expose us to significant additional risks and could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

 

 

  

  

 

business interruptions could harm our business 

  

operations at any of our facilities or at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure fire earthquake floods or other natural disasters we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur however we cannot be certain that our actions will be effective to avoid a significant impact on our business in the event of a disaster or other business interruption 

  

if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis and we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment if we experienced business interruptions we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers while the earthquake off the coast of japan in march 2011 did not directly impact any of our facilities or have a shortterm impact on our supply of materials the longerterm impact on our supply of materials and subcontractors and the economic impact that this event may have had on our customers and licensees is not yet fully known in addition business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2011 approximately 80 of our net sales were made to foreign customers during fiscal 2010 approximately 77 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political instability in the past and experienced some instability in bangkok in may 2010 though the situation in 2010 did not noticeably affect the area in which our facilities are located we also use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our operating results we use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of our nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in particular in periods when a foreign currency significantly declines in value in relation to the us dollar such as past declines in the euro relative to the us dollar customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products and customers transacting in that foreign currency may find it more difficult to fulfill their previously committed contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations to make payments or purchase products in periods when the us dollar is significantly declining in relation to the british pound euro and thai baht the operational costs in our european and thailand subsidiaries are adversely affected 

 

 

  

  

 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results we have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions but such disruptions could still occur and negatively impact our operations and financial results in addition we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we have determined that it is more cost effective to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the high premium costs the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects political risks and intellectual property matters should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous substances used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production cessation of operations or future liabilities such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could also restrict our ability to ship certain products to certain countries require us to modify our operations logistics or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses over the past several years there has been an expansion in environmental laws focusing on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products the european union and countries such as the us china korea and brazil have enacted or may enact such laws or regulations these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture and sell our products in addition over the last several years the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packaging materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold inventory that is not saleable as a result of changes to regulations we expect these risks and trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of hazardous substances in our products and energy efficiency measures 

 

customer demands and new regulations related to conflictfree minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act requires disclosure of use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals in the semiconductor industry these minerals are most commonly found in metals as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also since our supply chain is complex and some suppliers will not share their confidential supplier information we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are “conflict free” some customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it becomes unsaleable as a result of these evolving regulations 

 

 

  

  

  

climate change regulations and sustained adverse climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business 

 

new climate change regulations could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions fund offset projects or undertake other costly activities these regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment it is possible that new permits will be required for our current or expanded operations failure to receive timely permits could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or cessation of operations in addition new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and utility companies passing down carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs and renewable portfolio standards the cost of complying or of failing to comply with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

 

further any sustained adverse change in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us such as water and power shortages higher costs for water or energy to control the temperature inside of our facilities also certain of our operations are located in tropical regions such as thailand some environmental experts predict that these regions may become vulnerable to storms floods and droughts due to climate change while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be certain that our plans will protect us from all such disasters or events 

 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act export administration regulations ear and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us or local government that we have failed to comply with these or other export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges fines civil or criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business including our ability to meet our sales and earnings targets further a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries customers distributors or other third parties any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2009 and later we are currently being audited by the irs for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we are subject to certain income tax examinations in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal 2004 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

in addition the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock some or all of the foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our convertible debentures to decline or fluctuate substantially 

 

we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures 

 

we have acquired and expect in the future to acquire additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses the integration process for our acquisitions such as our acquisition of sst may be complex costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues expenses and liabilities we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards procedures and policies and we may be unable to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration there may be increased risk due to integrating financial reporting and internal control systems we may have difficulty in developing manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company or in growing the business at the rate we anticipate following an acquisition we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition we may suffer loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies we may be subject to claims by terminated employees shareholders of acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction acquisitions may also result in onetime charges such as acquisitionrelated expenses writeoffs restructuring charges or future impairment of goodwill contingent liabilities adverse tax consequences additional stockbased compensation expense and other charges that adversely affect our operating results additionally we may fund acquisitions of new businesses or strategic alliances by utilizing cash raising debt issuing shares of common stock or other mechanisms 

 

while the risks above may be relevant to all of our acquisitions our april 2010 acquisition of sst was a larger and more complex transaction than our other recent transactions and exposes us to greater risks and liabilities than we have encountered in the past 

 

further when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to a business that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated even following a divestiture we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers vendors or other third parties and such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

 

in addition to acquisitions we have in the past and expect in the future to enter into joint development agreements or other business or strategic relationships with other companies these transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected benefits of any such transaction to successfully market and sell any products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions 

 

we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or longlived assets 

 

we review our longlived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance because we operate in highly competitive environments projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from our actual results no goodwill or longlived asset impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

  

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our convertible debt 

 

as a result of our sale of 115 billion of principal value 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures in december 2007 we have a substantially greater amount of longterm debt than we have maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our debentures or any other future indebtedness that we incur on or before the maturity of the debentures there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

 

 

  

  

 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the one thousand dollars principal amount ie the conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices 

 

we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the fasb and the sec new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and may occur in the future new accounting pronouncements or a change in the interpretation of existing accounting standards or practices may have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is announced or effective 

 

potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 

 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries in fiscal 2009 president obamas administration announced initiatives that would substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the us changes in tax law such as these proposals could have a material negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 

 

the value of our investments in marketable equity investments could change materially 

 

our investments in availableforsale marketable securities at march 31 2011 consist of shares of public company common stock the value of which is determined by the closing price of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of our balance sheet date the market value of these investments was approximately 269 million at march 31 2011 the stock prices of these securities could materially decrease due to company performance andor marketrelated activity negatively affecting the value of these investments if we wanted to liquidate these investments at a time in which the stock prices had decreased from current levels our realized return would be materially and adversely affected depending on the number of shares we desire to sell relative to the daily trading volume in the shares in the event we desire to sell our marketable securities it may take several weeks or months to dispose of our position and our efforts to sell could drive down the price of the shares we are selling   

 

we may not realize a return on our nonmarketable equity investments 

 

at march 31 2011 we had investments of 77 million in several privately held companies including those that we acquired as a result of our sst acquisition that sst had purchased to support its strategic initiatives these companies range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue and business models many factors are critical to the success of these companies including product and technology development market acceptance of their products and technology and efficiency of operations if any of these private companies are unsuccessful as a result of these or other factors we could lose all or part of our investment in that company also if we determine that an otherthantemporary impairment to fair value exists in any of our nonmarketable equity investments we will need to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related impairment charge 

 

 

  

  

 

additionally we may desire to dispose of one or more of these nonmarketable equity investments however our investments in these private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of the investments to our advantage or even at all also for investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting the income or loss we are required to share from the investees income or loss could affect our earnings gains or losses from equity securities could vary from our expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities gains or losses from equity method investments and impairment charges 

 

credit conditions have adversely impacted our holdings of auction rate securities 

 

at march 31 2011 125   million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars historically the carrying value of ars approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates with the continuing liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions as a result we will not be able to access such funds until a future auction on these investments is successful 

 

our ars have experienced multiple rating downgrades by the major rating agencies the fair value of these ars has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions based on the estimated values we concluded these investments were other than temporarily impaired and recognized an impairment charge on these investments of 16 million during fiscal 2011 47 million during fiscal 2010 and 36 million during fiscal 2009 if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings 

 

the majority of our short and longterm investments are in highly rated government agency bonds and corporate bonds other than with respect to our holdings of ars we have not experienced any liquidity or impairment issues with such investments however there can be no assurance that credit markets conditions will not in the future adversely affect the liquidity or value of our investments in government agency bonds or corporate bonds

our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in item 1a – risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10k although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forwardlooking statement 

 

introduction 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 – business item 6 – selected financial data and item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

 

we begin our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of microchips overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 33  we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

strategy 

 

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices interface devices serial eeproms and our patented k ee l oq ® security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers with our acquisition of sst we have added flaship solutions and superflash memory products to our strategic focus we license superflash technology to foundries idms and design partners throughout the world for use in the manufacture of their advanced microcontroller products 

 

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets 

 

 

  

  

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and the assembly and test profit margin 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products flaship systems new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition business combinations sharebased compensation inventories income taxes junior subordinated convertible debentures and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

 

 

  

  

 

revenue recognition – distributors 

 

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

 

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance represents the amount of distributors original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2011 we had approximately 2081 million of deferred revenue and 681 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 1400 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2010 we had approximately 1484 million of deferred revenue and 495 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 989 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 719 million at march 31 2011 and 575 million at march 31 2010 on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing products from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributors working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be cancelled by us at any time 

 

 

  

  

 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance 

 

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

 

business combinations 

 

all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method of accounting i acquisitionrelated costs except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities will be expensed in the period incurred ii noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date iii inprocess research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility iv restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and v changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense or directly in contributed capital the measurement of fair value of assets accrued and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment the valuation of intangible assets and acquired investments in privately held companies in particular requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments acquired also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activity by the investees the investees capital structure and the terms of the investees issued interests 

 

we acquired sst on april 8 2010 in a business combination that is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting we finalized our purchase price allocation of sst in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill refer to note 2 for a summary of the april 8 2010 purchase price allocation 

  

sharebased compensation 

 

we measure at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2011 was 368 million of which 300 million was reflected in operating expenses total sharebased compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal 2011 was 68 million total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 35 million at march 31 2011 

 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans option pricing models including the blackscholes model require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is most reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts we estimate the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after april 1 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2011 was immaterial 

 

 

  

  

 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

 

inventories 

 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity such as in the second half of fiscal 2009 and the first half of fiscal 2010 the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales approximately 186 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2009 and approximately 223 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2010 as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs there were no such charges in fiscal 2011 

 

income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such assets will not be realized at march 31 2011 the valuation allowances totaled 504 million and consists of state net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and state tax credits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2011 our gross deferred tax asset was 888 million 

 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years 2009 and 2010 fiscal year 2011 is open for examination by tax authorities we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain appropriate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

 

junior subordinated convertible debentures 

 

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our junior subordinated convertible debentures in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations additionally certain embedded features of the debentures qualify as derivatives and are bundled as a compound embedded derivative that is measured at fair value lastly we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and current ability to settle the principal amount of the junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion price per share which was 2904 at march 31 2011 and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

 

 

  

  

 

contingencies 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcomes of these actions are not generally determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

 

acquisition of silicon storage technology inc sst 

 

on april 8 2010 we acquired sst a public company based in sunnyvale california in a merger transaction for 305 per share or a total of 3538 million which included 2954 million of cash consideration for the outstanding shares of sst common stock and 584 million of sst shares acquired by us on march 8 2010 the fair value of the sst shares held by us on april 8 2010 was equal to the fair value at march 8 2010 the date the shares were acquired and we did not recognize any gain or loss on such shares the sst business acquired included a variety of different business units including a licensing business focused on opportunities in the embedded control market a microcontroller business a variety of memory businesses and a wifi power amplifier business our primary reason for this acquisition was to gain access to ssts superflash technology and extensive patent portfolio which we believe are critical building blocks for advanced microcontrollers see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our sst acquisition 

 

the amount of continuing sst revenue included in our consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2011 was 2283 million the operations of sst were fully integrated into our operations as of october 1 2010 and as such cost of sales and operating expenses were no longer segregated in the third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2011 the amount of continuing sst revenue and earnings included in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the period april 9 2010 to september 30 2010 was 1149 million and 174 million respectively 

 

results of continuing operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 

 

net sales 

 

we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of flash intellectual property we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be provided primarily by letters of credit 

 

our net sales of 14872   million in fiscal 2011 increased by 5395 million or 569 over fiscal 2010 and our net sales of 9477 million in fiscal 2010 increased by 444 million or 49 over fiscal 2009 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 was due primarily to improving semiconductor industry conditions market share gains in our microcontroller and analog product lines and an increase in net sales due to the acquisition of sst the increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 was due primarily to improving semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains in our microcontroller and analog product lines average selling prices for our semiconductor products were down approximately 1 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 and were down approximately 7 in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 the number of units of our semiconductor products sold was up approximately 54 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 and up approximately 12 in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

microcontrollers 

 

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 682 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 810 of our total net sales in each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 the primary reason for the decrease in our microcontroller net sales as a percentage of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to prior fiscal years is our acquisition of sst which resulted in an increase in our memory product and technology licensing sales 

 

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 321 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and increased approximately 49 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from improving semiconductor industry conditions in the end markets that we serve including the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets as well as market share gains 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

memory products 

 

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 149 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 85 of our total net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 99 of our total net sales in fiscal 2009 the primary reason for the increase in our memory product net sales as a percentage of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to prior fiscal years is our acquisition of sst’s superflash memory products 

 

net sales of our memory products increased approximately 176 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and decreased approximately 103 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 excluding the sst memory product sales our memory product sales increased approximately 20 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was driven primarily by increased revenue due to our acquisition of sst improving semiconductor industry conditions and by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom and flash memory markets the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was driven primarily by global economic conditions and by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market 

 

memory product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our memory products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our memory products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

 

  

  

 

analog and interface products 

 

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 120 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 105 of our total net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 91 of our total net sales in fiscal 2009 

 

net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 783 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and increased approximately 213 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was driven primarily by improving semiconductor industry conditions market share gains achieved within the analog and interface market and increased revenue due to our acquisition of sst the increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was driven primarily by improving semiconductor industry conditions and market share gains achieved within the analog and interface market 

 

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than 70 of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products will increase over time 

 

technology licensing 

 

technology licensing revenue from our acquisition of sst includes a combination of license fees and royalties associated with ssts technology licensed for the use of superflash technology and fees for engineering services technology licensing accounted for approximately 48 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 

 

revenue from technology licensing can fluctuate over time due to semiconductor industry and general economic conditions 

 

other 

 

on february 16 2011 we acquired millennium microtech thailand mmt a provider of assembly and test services for semiconductor manufacturers this acquisition was done to provide us with assembly and test expansion capabilities revenue from assembly and test subcontracting services performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 accounted for approximately 01 of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 

  

distribution 

 

distributors accounted for 58 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 61 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 

 

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and 19 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 

 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

at march 31 2011 our distributors maintained 40 days of inventory of our products compared to 41 days at march 31 2010 and 38 days at march 31 2009 over the past three fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 31 days and 42 days we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

 

sales by geography 

 

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 80 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 approximately 77 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 75 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated the primary reason our sales to customers in asia increased in fiscal 2011 compared to prior periods was due to our acquisition of sst whose sales are more heavily weighted to asian customers compared to the rest of our business further sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2011 and 2010 and approximately 23 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2011 and approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2010 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 8744 million in fiscal 2011 5342 million in fiscal 2010 and 5165 million in fiscal 2009 gross profit as a percent of sales was 588 in fiscal 2011 564 in fiscal 2010 and 572 in fiscal 2009 

  

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were 

  

 

 

 

  

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

 

 

 

  

we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industryrelated conditions our wafer fabrication facilities operated at or above normal capacity levels which we typically consider to be 90 to 95 of the actual capacity of the installed equipment during the first half of fiscal 2009 the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and all of fiscal 2011 however during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 we reduced wafer starts at both fab 2 and fab 4 and implemented rotating unpaid time off at both fabrication facilities the reduction in wafer starts and rotating unpaid time off were implemented to help control inventory levels due to adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve reduced levels of production continued into the third quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of decreased production in our wafer fabs approximately 223 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2010 and approximately 186 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2009 there were no such charges in fiscal 2011 in the future if production levels are below normal capacity we will charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity during the first half of fiscal 2010 we operated at levels below the total operating capacity of our thailand facility due to adverse business conditions during the second half of fiscal 2010 and all of fiscal 2011 as business conditions improved we operated at normal levels of capacity at our thailand facility and we selectively increased our assembly and test capacity at such facility 

 

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 022 to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

 

 

  

  

 

our overall inventory levels were 1808 million at march 31 2011 compared to 1166 million at march 31 2010 and 1315 million at march 31 2009 we maintained 107 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2011 compared to 97 days of inventory at march 31 2010 and 134 days at march 31 2009 our inventory levels at march 31 2011 were at the lower end of the range we have experienced over the past three years we expect to grow inventory levels in the june 2011 quarter to allow us to maintain short lead times and support our customers delivery requirements 

 

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by capacity utilization levels the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface memory products and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

 

at march 31 2011 approximately 61 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 65 at march 31 2010 and approximately 77 at march 31 2009 the percentage of our assembly work that is performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry and our internal capacity capabilities thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations at march 31 2011 approximately 88 of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to substantially all of our test requirements being performed in our thailand facility in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process the primary reason for the decrease in the portion of assembly and test operations performed in our thailand facility in fiscal 2011 compared to each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was due to our acquisition of sst which had outsourced 100 of its assembly and test operations prior to being acquired by microchip we are bringing a portion of ssts assembly and test volume into our thailand facilities over time 

 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements as a result of our acquisition of sst we have become more reliant on outside foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements in fiscal 2011 approximately 20   of our total net sales related to products which were purchased from outside wafer foundries 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

 

research and development rd 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2011 were 1706 million or 115 of sales compared to 1208 million or 128 of sales for fiscal 2010 and 1155 million or 128 of sales for fiscal 2009 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

 

rd expenses increased 498 million or 412 for fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 were higher salary and bonus costs and additional costs from our acquisition of sst rd expenses increased 53 million or 46 for fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 were higher salary and bonus costs related to restoring previous reductions in compensation programs due to improving business conditions 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 were 2278   million or 153 of sales compared to 1672 million or 177 of sales for fiscal 2010 and 1612 million or 179 of sales for fiscal 2009 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

 

 

  

  

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 606   million or 362 for fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 were higher salary and bonus costs and additional costs from our acquisition of sst selling general and administrative expenses increased 60 million or 37 for fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 were higher salary and bonus costs related to restoring previous reductions in compensation programs due to improving business conditions 

 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

 

special charges 

 

sst acquisition 

 

during fiscal 2011 we incurred 19 million of severancerelated and office closure costs associated with our acquisition of sst 

 

patent licenses 

 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we agreed to the terms of a patent license with an unrelated third party and signed an agreement on july 9 2009 the patent license settled alleged infringement claims the total payment made to the thirdparty in july 2009 was 14 million 12 million of which was expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the remaining 02 million was recorded as a prepaid royalty that was amortized over the remaining life of the patent which expired in june 2010 

 

we entered into a patent portfolio license effective march 31 2009 with an unrelated thirdparty that covered both issued patents and patent applications and settled alleged infringement claims the total payment made to the thirdparty was 825 million 40 million of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and the remaining 425 million of which was recorded as a prepaid royalty that will be amortized over the life of the patents we entered into another agreement with the same unrelated third party in march 2011 and 275 million was paid covering patent applications for future technology to be licensed the 275 million was recorded as a prepaid royalty that will be amortized over the life of the patents 

 

expenses associated with the abandonment of the atmel acquisition 

 

on october 2 2008 we and on semiconductor corporation announced that we had sent a proposal to the board of directors of atmel corporation to acquire atmel for 500 per share in cash or a total of approximately 23 billion on october 29 2008 atmel announced that its board of directors had determined that the unsolicited proposal was inadequate on february 10 2009 we announced our termination of our consideration of a potential transaction with atmel in light of the economic uncertainty and the lack of visibility with respect to atmels business not allowing us to put a value on atmel in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we expensed 16 million of various costs associated with the terminated proposal 

 

inprocess research and development 

 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we completed our acquisition of hampshire company a leader in the large format touch screen controller market as a result of the acquisition we incurred a 05 million inprocess research and development charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we completed the acquisition of hitech software a provider of software development tools and compilers as a result of the acquisition we incurred a 02 million inprocess research and development charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we completed our acquisition of re international a leader in developing innovative integrated circuits for smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and other lifesafety systems as a result of the acquisition we incurred a 02 million inprocess research and development charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

 

  

  

 

other income expense 

 

interest income in fiscal 2011 increased to 160 million from 153 million in fiscal 2010 interest income in fiscal 2010 decreased to 153 million from 325 million in fiscal 2009 the primary reason for the increase in interest income in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 was a higher rate of return realized on certain of our investments the primary reason for the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 was lower interest rates on our shortterm investments interest expense related to our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures in fiscal 2011 was 315 million compared to 312 million in fiscal 2010 and 294 million in fiscal 2009 other income  net in fiscal 2011 was 19 million compared to other income net of 87 million in fiscal 2010 and other expense net of 44 million in fiscal 2009 the decrease in other income net during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily relates to 75 million of gains on trading securities during fiscal 2010 the increase in other income net in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily relates to 75 million of gains on trading securities during fiscal 2010 compared to 73 million of losses on trading securities during fiscal 2009 these gains and losses were a result of market fluctuations in the value of certain strategic investments in publicly traded companies which we classified as trading securities there were no such gains or losses in fiscal 2011 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 68 in fiscal 2011 our effective tax rate was 88 in fiscal 2010 and our effective tax benefit was 58 in fiscal 2009 excluding onetime tax events our effective tax rate is lower than statutory rates in the us primarily due to our mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates changes in tax regulations and the reinstatement of the rd tax credit in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 includes a 244 million benefit related to various items including a settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008 tax audits the expiration of the statute of limitations on various tax reserves and a charge related to a corporate restructuring this benefit reduced our effective tax rate from continuing operations by 54 percentage points to an effective tax rate of 68 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 includes a 85 million us tax benefit related to our settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004 tax audits this benefit reduced our effective tax rate by 36 percentage points to an effective tax rate of 88 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 includes a 169 million us tax benefit related to our settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2005 tax audit and a 330 million tax reserve release associated with a favorable clarification of tax regulations which had an ongoing benefit on our effective tax rate combined these tax benefits reduced our effective tax rate by 215 percentage points to an effective tax benefit of 58 

 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years 2009 and 2010 fiscal year 2011 is open for examination by tax authorities we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

 

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future and any expiration of our tax holidays in thailand are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

 

results of discontinued operations 

 

as a result of our acquisition of sst certain of ssts product lines were marketed for sale based on managements decision regarding them not being a strategic fit into our product portfolio the discontinued businesses include various memory product lines for financial statement purposes the net assets and results of operations for these discontinued businesses have been segregated from those of the continuing operations and are presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and assets held for sale on may 21 2010 we completed a transaction to sell one of the businesses acquired from sst to greenliant systems ltd the sale price in this transaction was determined by management to represent fair value and accordingly no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of the net assets in this sale we disposed of approximately 236 million of assets held for sale primarily comprised of inventory property plant and equipment intangible assets and nonmarketable securities consideration in the transaction was in the form of cash and notes receivable from greenliant systems ltd on july 8 2010 we granted an exclusive limited license for certain serial norflash products to professional computer technology ltd pct the license is limited to certain industry segments and geographic regions and excludes certain multinational customers pct has no license to sell these products to any other industry segment or geographic region other than as set forth in our agreement with them 

 

 

  

  

 

the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 was 102 million or 005 per diluted share contributing to the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 was 94 million of inventory writedowns related to discontinued operations as of march 31 2011 there were no assets held for sale remaining on our consolidated balance sheet 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we had 17083 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2011 an increase of 1768 million from the march 31 2010 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities being offset by dividend payments of 2568 million during fiscal year 2011 and cash of 1127 million used to acquire sst net of cash received in that acquisition 

 

net cash provided from operating activities was 5827 million for fiscal 2011 4520 million for fiscal 2010 and 3087 million for fiscal 2009 the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher net income in fiscal 2011 partially offset by fiscal 2010 proceeds of 870 million of trading securities which were sold during that year the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to net sales of trading securities in fiscal 2010 of 870 million compared to net purchases of trading securities of 735 million in fiscal 2009 the lower net income in fiscal 2010 was also offset by changes in working capital 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 1879 million for fiscal 2011 1953 million for fiscal 2010 and 198 million in fiscal 2009 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in cash related to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments being partially offset by cash used to acquire sst and higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments offset by lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 and 584 million used on an investment in the common stock of sst at 305 per share 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 1830 million for fiscal 2011 2110   million for fiscal 2010 and 3302 million for fiscal 2009 proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were 719 million for fiscal 2011 365 million for fiscal 2010 and 336 million for fiscal 2009 we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of 2568 million in fiscal 2011 2496 million in fiscal 2010 and 2467 million in fiscal 2009 cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 1239 million in fiscal 2009 no amounts were expended in fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 for the repurchase of our common stock 

 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 1245 million in fiscal 2011 476 million in fiscal 2010 and 1024 million in fiscal 2009 the higher capital expenditure activity in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior fiscal years was primarily driven by increased production requirements to support increases in revenue   capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 125 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

 

we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2011 we had no foreign currencyforward contracts outstanding 

 

on december 11 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions   as of march 31 2011 we had repurchased 75 million shares under this 10 million share authorization for a total of 2347 million there is no expiration date associated with this program the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon market conditions interest rates and corporate considerations 

 

as of march 31 2011 we held approximately 292 million shares as treasury shares 

 

 

  

  

 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 41 million to date our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately 14074 million during fiscal 2011 we paid dividends in the amount of 1374 per share for a total dividend payment of 2568 million during fiscal 2010 we paid dividends in the amount of 1359 per share for a total dividend payment of 2496 million during fiscal 2009 we paid dividends in the amount of 1346 per share for a total dividend payment of 2467 million on may 5 2011 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0346 per share which will be paid on june 2 2011 to stockholders of record on may 19 2011 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 657 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2011 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of march 31 2011 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multipleelement arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting additionally these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration these new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we do not expect these new standards to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements these new standards amend the scope of preexisting software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance nonsoftware components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products these new standards are required to be adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we do not expect these new standards to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in april 2010 the fasb issued amended accounting guidance for vendors who apply the milestone method of revenue recognition to research and development arrangements the amended guidance applies to arrangements with payments that are contingent at inception upon achieving substantively uncertain future events or circumstances the amended guidance is effective on a prospective basis for us for milestones achieved on or after april 1 2011 we do not expect these new standards to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our investments are intended to establish a highquality portfolio that preserves principal meets liquidity needs avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to our investment guidelines and market conditions our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities money market funds cash deposits and marketable securities that we hold on an availableforsale basis was  17083   million as of march 31 2011 compared to 15066 million as of march 31 2010 and we had no trading securities balance as of march 31 2011 compared to 249 million in trading securities as of march 31 2010 the availableforsale debt securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

  

  

 

at march 31 2011 125 million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars historically the carrying value of ars approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates if an auction fails for amounts we have invested our investment will not be liquid with the continuing liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions while we continue to earn interest on these investments based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices the estimated market value for a portion of these ars no longer approximates the original purchase value 

 

the fair value of the failed ars of 125 million has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions we evaluated the impairments in the value of these ars determining our intent to sell these securities prior to the recovery of our amortized cost basis resulted in the securities being otherthantemporarily impaired and recognized impairment charges on these investments of 16   million in fiscal 2011 and 47 million in fiscal 2010 if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings 

 

investments in marketable equity investments 

 

our availableforsale marketable equity investments at march 31 2011 consist of shares of public company common stock the value of which is determined by the closing price of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of the balance sheet date these investments are classified as marketable securities and accounted for under the provisions of asc 320 investments  debt and equity securities  the market value of these investments was approximately 269 million at march 31 2011 compared to our cost basis of approximately 262 million the value of our investments in these securities would be materially impacted if there was a significant change in the market price of the shares a hypothetical 30 favorable or unfavorable change in the stock prices compared to the stock prices at march 31 2011 would have affected the value of our investments in marketable equity securities by approximately 80 million see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our investments in these marketable securities 

 

investments in nonmarketable equity investments 

 

we have investments in several privately held companies including those that we acquired as a result of our sst acquisition that sst had purchased to support its strategic initiatives these companies range from earlystage companies to more mature companies with established revenue and business models these companies are dependent upon successful execution of their product and technology development acceptance of their products and technology in the markets they serve and financial and operational efficiency if any of these private companies are unsuccessful in these and other related initiatives or if there are factors beyond their control in the markets which they serve their performance could be affected materially resulting in a loss of some or all of their value which would in turn require us to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment to fair value exists in such investments if an otherthantemporary impairment of fair value exists we will need to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related impairment charge to our income statement our nonmarketable equity investments excluding those accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 56 million as of march 31 2011 as of march 31 2011 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 21 million

the board of directors and stockholders of 

microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries 

  

we have audited microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2011 based on the coso criteria  

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the march 31 2011 consolidated financial statements of microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries and our report dated may 31 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

industry background 

 

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and various analog and interface products 

 

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market at approximately 14 billion in calendar year 2008 microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures 4bit microcontrollers are the smallest segment of the microcontroller market and have been in decline for several years 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of high volume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications 

 

our products 

 

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

 

microcontrollers 

 

we offer a broad family of microcontroller products featuring our unique proprietary architecture marketed under the pic brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 7 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our pic products are designed for applications requiring field programmability high performance low power and cost effectiveness they feature a variety of memory technology configurations low voltage and power small footprint and ease of use our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set computer referred to as risc and variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative singlebus complex instruction set computer architectures referred to as cisc with approximately 600 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontroller markets 

 

digital signal controllers dsc are a subset of our 16bit microcontroller offering our dspic   digital signal controller families integrate the control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of digital signal processors dsps along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic digital signal controllers enlarge our addressable market 

 

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced lowcost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

 

 

 

development tools 

 

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic digital signal controllers for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

 

our family of development tools for pic and dspic devices operates in the standard windows ® environment on standard pc hardware these tools range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation hardware customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our pic and dspic development tools share the same integrated development environment 

 

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are approximately 200 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

 

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped more than 750000 development tools 

 

analog and interface products 

 

our analog and interface products consist of several families with over 550 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management and interface products at the end of fiscal 2009 our mixedsignal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 13100 end customers 

 

we continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy as well as to new customers in addition to our “attach” strategy we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

 

memory products 

 

our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable readonly memory referred to as serial eeproms we sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide serial eeprom products are used for nonvolatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods serial eeproms have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small devices 

 

manufacturing 

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wafer fabrication 

 

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 to 50 microns during fiscal 2008 and the first half of fiscal 2009 fab 2 operated at approximately 99 of its capacity in response to lower demand in the second half of fiscal 2009 we reduced the production levels of fab 2 to about 60 of capacity operating at lower percentages of capacity has a negative impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing 

 

 

 

we acquired fab 4 in august 2002 and began production in october 2003 fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 022 to 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns similar to fab 2 fab 4 was operating at about 100 of its active capacity during the first half of fiscal 2009 we reduced the production levels of fab 4 in the second half of fiscal 2009 to about 60 of its active capacity a significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment acquired with fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand over the next several years with modest incremental capital expenditures 

 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

 

we outsource a small percentage of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities 

 

assembly and test 

 

we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand as of march 31 2009 approximately 77 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2009 our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

 

during fiscal 2009 we completed certain projects to increase capacity at our assembly and test operation in thailand due to lower demand in the second half of fiscal 2009 we are currently operating at levels significantly below the total operating capacity of our thailand facility 

 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

 

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

 

historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules in order to respond to such requirements we must maintain a significant work in process and finished goods inventory 

 

at the end of fiscal 2009 we owned identifiable longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the united states amounting to 3681 million and 1636 million in other countries including 1524 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2008 we owned identifiable longlived assets in the united states amounting to 4006 million and 1217 million in other countries including 1131 million in thailand 

 

research and development rd 

 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers serial eeprom memory analog and interface products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

 

 

 

in fiscal 2009 our rd expenses were 1155   million compared to 1209   million in fiscal 2008 and 1137 million in fiscal 2007 rd expenses included 109 million in fiscal 2009 107 million in fiscal 2008 and 96 million in fiscal 2007 of sharebased compensation as a result of the adoption of fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas no 123r

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

 

distribution 

 

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

 

in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 we derived 64 of our net sales through distributors and 36 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip in fiscal 2007 we derived 65 of our net sales through distributors and 35 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 a second distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

 

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

sales by geography 

 

sales by geography for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 23 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 20 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 in each of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

 

 

 

our international sales are predominately us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in recent periods adverse global economic conditions and weakness in the housing market have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

 

backlog 

 

as of april 30 2009 our backlog was approximately 1355 million compared to 2257 million as of april 30 2008 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

 

competition 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products furthermore recent adverse economic conditions have resulted in a current over capacity in the semiconductor industry and excess capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect market pricing and our competitive position 

 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

we maintain a portfolio of us and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2009 and 2027 we also have numerous additional us and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 

 

 

 

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

 

environmental regulation 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 

 

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of or to adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

 

employees 

 

as of march 31 2009 we had 4895 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend 

 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

 

our operating results have been adversely impacted by global economic conditions and may fluctuate due to a number of other factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

 

our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock the recent downturn in global economic conditions has adversely impacted our operating results and makes comparability between periods less meaningful 

 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity in the quarter ended march 31 2009 we reduced wafer starts in both fab 2 and fab 4 implemented rotating unpaid time off and had and continue to have multiple planned shutdowns in our thailand facility these actions were implemented to help control inventory levels in response to current and expected adverse economic conditions this lower capacity utilization resulted in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins we are unable to predict when we will be able to return to more optimal levels of capacity utilization 

 

 

 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results may suffer for example in the quarter ended december 31 2008 we and the semiconductor industry in general did not achieve the level of turns orders required to meet our targets which adversely impacted our revenue and results of operations for the december quarter 

 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 

 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog products we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 64 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and approximately 65 of net sales in fiscal 2007 our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

 

continued adverse conditions in the us and global economies and in the us and global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation in addition during an industry andor economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough of our products by our distributors which could reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

 

 

recent credit and equity market conditions have adversely impacted our holdings of auction rate securities investments and trading securities which has had a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

 

at march 31 2009 468 million of the fair value of our investment portfolio was invested in auction rate securities ars historically the carrying value of ars approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates with the continuing liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions as a result we will not be able to access such funds until a future auction on these investments is successful in november 2008 we executed an ars rights agreement the rights with the broker through which we purchased 319 million of our ars that provides 1 us with the right to put these ars back to the broker at par anytime during the period from june 30 2010 through july 2 2012 and 2 the broker with the right to purchase or sell the ars at par on our behalf anytime through july 2 2012 we accounted for the acceptance of the rights as the receipt of a put option for no consideration and recognized a gain with a corresponding recognition as a longterm investment we elected to measure the rights under the fair value option of sfas no 159 and will record changes in the fair value of the rights in earnings we simultaneously recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss of 55 million as we no longer intend to hold the ars to a time where the fair value recovers which was recorded in other comprehensive loss in prior quarters we have reclassified the ars from availableforsale to trading securities and future changes in fair value will be recorded in earnings we expect any future changes in the fair value of the ars to be largely offset by changes in the fair value of the related rights without any significant net impact to our income statement we will continue to measure the ars and the rights at fair value utilizing level 3 inputs until the earlier of their maturity or exercise 

 

the fair value of our failed ars has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions based on the estimated values we concluded these investments were other than temporarily impaired and recognized an impairment charge on these investments of 24 million during fiscal 2008 and 36 million during fiscal 2009 if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings 

 

the substantial majority of our short and longterm investments are in highly rated government agency bonds and municipal bonds other than with respect to our holdings of ars we have not experienced any liquidity or impairment issues with such investments however the credit markets have continued to be highly volatile and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not in the future adversely affect the liquidity or value of our investments in government agency bonds or municipal bonds 

 

our investment in marketable equity securities at march 31 2009 consisted of shares of common stock the value of which is determined by the closing prices of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of the balance sheet date these investments are classified as trading securities and accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the market value of these investments was approximately 795 million at march 31 2009 compared to our cost basis of approximately 855 million the value of our investments in marketable equity securities would be materially impacted if there were a significant change in the market price of the shares additionally we have sold put options on some of our trading securities which are recorded as accrued liabilities and are marked to market value a decline in the stock price of the underlying security prior to the expiration date of the puts would cause an increase to the liability which would result in a charge to our results of operations and could result in the put being exercised by the holder if the put is exercised by the holder we could be required to pay up to 110 million for additional shares of the common stock at a price potentially in excess of the then fair market value of the common stock which would result in a charge to our results of operations as a result any fluctuations in the value of our marketable securities could result in unexpected fluctuations in our financial results 

 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel can be intense 

 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel can be intense 

 

we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

 

we are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us 

 

we use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption further procurement of required products and services from third parties is done by purchase order and contracts if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

 

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however fluctuations in our overall business in certain recent periods semiconductor industry conditions and adverse global economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions in particular our business and operating results have been adversely impacted by continuing adverse global economic conditions 

  

  

 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in the value of our inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the performance or use of our products these claims may be due to products’ nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes and unexpected end customer system issues due to the interaction with our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including costs related to writing off the value of inventory of nonconforming products recalling nonconforming products providing support services product replacements or modification to products the defense of such claims diversion of resources from other projects lost revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders and unpaid receivables customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements and a requirement to pay damages 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell these expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have liability insurance which covers damages arising out of product defects but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to claims if our products or interactions with our products cause the system failures we will face increased exposure to claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products 

 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us 

 

our operating results may be adversely impacted if economic conditions impact the financial viability of our customers distributors or suppliers 

 

we regularly review the financial performance of our customers distributors and suppliers however global economic conditions may adversely impact the financial viability of our customers distributors or suppliers the financial failure of a large customer or distributor an important supplier or a group thereof could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in us not being able to collect our accounts receivable balances 

 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers 

 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we have approximately 63000 customers and our ten largest direct customers made up approximately 9 of our total revenue for the year ended march 31 2009 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits 

 

 

 

further as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale under these contracts we commit to supply quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates if we become unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or quality related issues under these contracts we may be liable for the costs the customer has incurred while we try to limit such liabilities if they should arise there may be a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

 

business interruptions could harm our business 

 

operations at any of our facilities or at any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure fire earthquake floods or other natural disasters if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis if this occurs we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers in addition business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 approximately 75 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political uncertainty in the past we also use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease andor our operating results could suffer 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency could impact our operating results we use forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the value of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption including but not limited to new system implementations computer viruses security breaches or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results we have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions but such disruptions could still occur and negatively impact our operations and financial results in addition we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

  

  

 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some potentially significant risks and obligations in these circumstances we have determined that it is more cost effective to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the increased premium costs in place since the disruption in the insurance market after the events of september 11 2001 the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects political risks and patent infringement should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition result of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our products and manufacturing processes our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or a cessation of operations such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities 

 

over the past few years there has been an expansion in environmental laws focusing on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products for example the eu rohs directive provided that beginning on july 1 2006 electronic products sold into europe were required to meet stringent chemical restrictions including the absence of lead other countries such as the us china and korea have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to those of the eu these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture and sell our products over the last several years the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packaging materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant products to meet customers’ needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold inventory that is not saleable as a result of changes to regulations we expect these trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to the reduction or elimination of hazardous substances in our products and energy efficiency measures 

 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions’ export regulations our usmanufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to export administration regulations ear when exported and reexported to and from international jurisdictions licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain countries noncompliance with ear or other export regulations can result in penalties including denial of export privileges fines criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business including our ability to meet our net sales and earnings targets 

 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for fiscal 2002 and later other than fiscal 2005 we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our common stock 

 

 

 

in the event we make acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits 

 

we may consider strategic acquisitions if such opportunities arise any transactions that we consider may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business for those transactions that we complete or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process in addition we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies which may lead to operational inefficiencies 

 

we have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

 

as a result of our sale of 115 billion of 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures in december 2007 we have a substantially greater amount of longterm debt than we have maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our debentures or any other future indebtedness that we incur on or before the maturity of the debentures there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock upon conversion we intend to satisfy the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value of the debentures in cash if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of one thousand dollars principal amount conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

 

there will likely be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 

 

there will likely be new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations for example in may 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 141  that alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt that allows for either mandatory or optional cash settlements including our outstanding debentures fsp apb 141 requires the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost further fsp apb 141 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component as equity and then accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to result in the “economic interest cost” being reflected in the consolidated statements of income in issuing fsp apb 141 the fasb emphasized that fsp apb 141 will be applied to the terms of the instruments as they existed for the time periods presented therefore the application of fsp apb 141 would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented fsp apb 141 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will require retrospective application we will be required to implement the proposed standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 which begins on april 1 2009 although fsp apb 141 will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows it will require us to record a significant amount of noncash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized in addition if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity any unamortized debt discount would result in a loss on extinguishment as a result there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and earnings per share these impacts could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of our debentures 

 

 

 

recently proposed us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially impact our business and financial results 

 

currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our assets including employees are located outside the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries president obama’s administration has recently announced initiatives that would substantially reduce our ability to defer us taxes including repealing the deferral of us taxation of foreign earnings eliminating utilization of or substantially reducing our ability to claim foreign tax credits and eliminating various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the us if any of these proposals are constituted into legislation they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations

 item 3     legal proceedings 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them we also periodically receive notification from various third parties alleging infringement of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to these pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcome of these actions is not presently determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future 

 

on april 18 2008 lsi logic and its wholly owned subsidiary agere filed both an action with the international trade commission and a complaint in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging patent infringement by microchip and 22 other semiconductor and foundry companies these actions seek monetary damages and injunctive relief against the allegedly infringing products the outcome of these actions is not presently determinable and therefore we can make no assessment of their materiality the target date for completion of the international trade commission investigation is september 21 2009 the us district court action is stayed pending resolution of the itc matter microchip intends to vigorously defend its rights in these matters

introduction 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 1 – business” “item 6 – selected financial data” and “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

we begin our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of microchip’s overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 30 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements” 

 

strategy 

 

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices interface devices serial eeproms and our patented keeloq ® security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

 

 

 

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets over the last two quarters of fiscal 2009 the downturn in the us and global economies has adversely impacted our key markets resulting in adverse fluctuations in our business in response to these adverse economic conditions we have significantly reduced our operating expenses and are operating our manufacturing facilities at lower production levels we are unable to predict how long such adverse business conditions will continue 

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit margin 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products 

 

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition sharebased compensation inventories investments income taxes property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment junior subordinated convertible debentures and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

  

  

 

revenue recognition – distributors 

 

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

 

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors’ resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors’ outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the “deferred income on shipments to distributors” balance represents the amount of distributors’ original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2009 we had approximately 1182 million of deferred revenue and 343 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 839 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2008 we had approximately 1304 million of deferred revenue and 350 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 954 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

 

distributor advances reflected as a reduction of deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets totaled 376 million at march 31 2009 and 364 million at march 31 2008 on sales to distributors our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us for an amount in excess of their ultimate cost the sales price to our distributors may be higher than the amount that the distributors will ultimately owe us because distributors often negotiate price reductions after purchasing the product from us and such reductions are often significant it is our practice to apply these negotiated price discounts to future purchases requiring the distributor to settle receivable balances on a current basis generally within 30 days for amounts originally invoiced this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors as such we have entered into agreements with certain distributors whereby we advance cash to the distributors to reduce the distributor’s working capital requirements these advances are reconciled at least on a quarterly basis and are estimated based on the amount of ending inventory as reported by the distributor multiplied by a negotiated percentage such advances have no impact on our revenue recognition or our consolidated statements of income we process discounts taken by distributors against our deferred income on shipments to distributors’ balance and trueup the advanced amounts generally after the end of each completed fiscal quarter the terms of these advances are set forth in binding legal agreements and are unsecured bear no interest on unsettled balances and are due upon demand the agreements governing these advances can be cancelled by us at any time 

 

 

 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors’ balance 

 

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are recorded at their approximate carrying value 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we adopted sfas no 123r which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2009 was 334 million of which 266 million was reflected in operating expenses total sharebased compensation included in cost of sales in fiscal 2009 was 58 million total sharebased compensation included in our inventory balance was 47 million at march 31 2009 

 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plans consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholes model also require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after april 1 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2009 was immaterial 

 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

 

inventories 

 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

 

in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity such as in the second half of fiscal 2009 the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales 

 

 

 

investments 

 

we classify our investments as trading securities or availableforsale securities based upon management’s intent with regard to the investments and the nature of the underlying securities 

 

our trading securities consist of strategic investments in shares of publicly traded common stock restricted cash representing cash collateral for put options we have sold on some of our trading securities and ars that we intend to dispose of through the exercise of a put option see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the ars put option our investments in trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other income expense 

 

our availableforsale investments consist of government agency bonds municipal bonds ars and corporate bonds our investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity to the extent any unrelated losses are determined to be temporary premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related availableforsale security dividend and interest income are recognized when earned the cost of securities sold is calculated using the specific identification method 

 

we include within our shortterm investments our trading securities as well as our income yielding availableforsale securities that can be readily converted to cash and include within longterm investments those income yielding availableforsale securities with maturities of over one year that have unrealized losses attributable to them or those that cannot be readily liquidated we have the ability to hold our longterm investments with temporary impairments until such time as these assets are no longer impaired such recovery of unrealized losses is not expected to occur within the next year 

 

due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on certain of our investment portfolio of ars we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values including assessments of counterparty credit quality default risk underlying the security discount rates and overall capital market liquidity the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict factors that may impact our ars valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities rates of default of the underlying assets underlying collateral value discount rates counterparty risk the ongoing strength and quality of the credit markets and market liquidity 

 

the credit markets experienced significant deterioration and uncertainty beginning in the second half of fiscal 2008 if these conditions continue or we experience any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in our portfolio including our ars we may incur additional impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

 

income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2009 our gross deferred tax asset was 696 million 

 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 2004 2006 2007 and 2008 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

 

 

 

property plant  equipment 

 

property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred at march 31 2009 the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled 5317 million which represents 22 of our total assets this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 5 to 7 years on manufacturing equipment from 10 to 15 years on leasehold improvements and approximately 30 years on buildings 

 

we began production activities at fab 4 on october 31 2003 we began to depreciate the fab 4 assets as they were placed in service for production purposes as of march 31 2009 all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service all manufacturing equipment that was not being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management believes there will be no change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into productive service the lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets 

 

the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations could result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

 

impairment of property plant and equipment 

 

we assess whether indicators of impairment of longlived assets are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value if less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset we may incur impairment losses or additional losses on already impaired assets in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 

 

junior subordinated convertible debentures 

 

we account for our junior subordinated convertible debentures and related provisions in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force issue eitf no 985 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 0027 application of issue no 985 to certain convertible instruments eitf no 0019 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock eitf no 016 the meaning of “indexed to a company’s own stock” and eitf no 0408 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share we also evaluate the instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments and measurement of fair value for accounting purposes eitf no 0408 requires us to include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and current ability to settle the principal amount of the junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion price per share which was 3206 at march 31 2009 and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

litigation 

 

our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can reasonably estimate the amount and range of loss recorded reserves were immaterial at march 31 2009 

 

because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on our pending litigation we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 

 

net sales 

 

we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customer’s financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be provided primarily by letters of credit 

 

our net sales of 9033   million in fiscal 2009 decreased by 1324 million or 128 over fiscal 2008 and our net sales of 10357 million in fiscal 2008 decreased by 39 million or 04 over fiscal 2007 the decreases in net sales in these periods resulted primarily from adverse changes in global economic and end market conditions across all of our product lines average selling prices for our products were down approximately 4 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and were down approximately 3 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the number of units of our products sold was down approximately 9 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and up approximately 3 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years key factors impacting the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

microcontrollers 

 

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 81 of our total net sales in fiscal 2009 approximately 804 of our total net sales in fiscal 2008 and approximately 802 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 

 

net sales of our microcontroller products decreased approximately 122 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and decreased approximately 02 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 resulted primarily from deteriorating global economic conditions in the markets we serve and those factors described above the end markets we serve include consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing markets the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve particularly the housing and consumer markets 

 

 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

memory products 

 

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 99 of our total net sales in fiscal 2009 approximately 116 of our total net sales in fiscal 2008 and approximately 118 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 

 

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 257 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and decreased approximately 20 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 these sales decreases were driven primarily by global economic conditions and by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales 

 

serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

analog and interface products 

 

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 91 of our total net sales in fiscal 2009 approximately 80 of our total net sales in fiscal 2008 and approximately 80 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 

 

net sales of our analog and interface products were essentially flat in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and were essentially flat in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 net sales of our analog and interface products in these periods were driven primarily by deteriorating global economic conditions market share gains and supply and demand conditions within the analog and interface market 

 

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than half of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products will increase over time 

 

distribution 

 

distributors accounted for 64 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 

 

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 19 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and approximately 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 

 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationship with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

at march 31 2009 our distributors maintained 38 days of inventory of our products compared to 33 days at march 31 2008 and 32 days at march 31 2007 over the past three fiscal years the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 31 days and 42 days thus inventory levels at our distributors are at the higher end of the range we have experienced over the last three years we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

 

 

 

sales by geography 

 

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the us canada central america and south america 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated sales to customers in asia have generally increased over time due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 23 of our net sales in fiscal 2009 approximately 20 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and approximately 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

 

gross profit 

 

our gross profit was 5165 million in fiscal 2009 6249 million in fiscal 2008 and 6248 million in fiscal 2007 gross profit as a percent of sales was 572 in fiscal 2009 603 in fiscal 2008 and 601 in fiscal 2007 

 

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report were 

 

 

 

 

other factors that impacted gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

 

 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2009 we operated at approximately 84 of our combined fab 2 and fab 4 installed capacity during each of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 we operated at approximately 99 of our combined fab 2 and fab 4 installed capacity during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 we reduced wafer starts at both fab 2 and fab 4 and implemented rotating unpaid time off at both fabrication facilities the reduction in wafer starts and rotating unpaid time off were implemented to help control inventory levels due to current and expected adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect our wafer fabs to continue to operate at levels which are significantly lower than peak levels 

 

the process technologies utilized in our wafer fabs impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes fab 4 predominantly utilizes our 022 to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

 

our overall inventory levels were 1315 million at march 31 2009 compared to 1245 million at march 31 2008 and 1210 million at march 31 2007 we maintained 134 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2009 compared to 112 days of inventory at march 31 2008 and 107 days at march 31 2007 during the latter part of fiscal 2009 the demand for our products was adversely impacted by the downturn in global economic conditions we were not able to reduce production levels during that time frame to the extent needed to prevent inventory from rising 

 

 

 

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption capacity utilization levels and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve 

 

at march 31 2009 approximately 77 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 67 at march 31 2008 and approximately 72 at march 31 2007 thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility over the last three fiscal years we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process we are planning multiple plant shutdowns of our thailand facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to help control inventory levels due to current and expected adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve 

 

as a result of significant reductions in demand and decreased production in our wafer fabs and assembly and test operations approximately 214 million was charged to cost of sales in fiscal 2009 as our production levels for the period were below the range of normal capacity there were no such charges in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 if production levels stay below our normal capacity we will continue to charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed manufacturing costs also charged to cost of sales during fiscal 2009 was 73 million of obsolescence reserve compared to 19 million in fiscal 2008 and 23 million fiscal 2007 the increase in the obsolescence reserve charge was primarily due to decreased demand for our products related to the adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve 

 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication requirements 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

 

research and development rd 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2009 were 1155 million or 128 of sales compared to 1209 million or 117 of sales for fiscal 2008 and 1137 million or 109 of sales for fiscal 2007 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

 

rd expenses decreased 53 million or 44 for fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 the primary reasons for the dollar decrease in rd costs in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 were costcutting actions taken in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 including salary reductions elimination of bonuses and reductions in travel costs rd expenses increased 72 million or 63 for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal rd headcount and 11 million of additional sharebased compensation expense 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 were 1612   million or 179 of sales compared to 1756 million or 169 of sales for fiscal 2008 and 1632 million or 157 of sales for fiscal 2007 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 144   million or 82 for fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 the primary reasons for the dollar decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 were costcutting actions taken in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 including salary reductions elimination of bonuses and reduction in travel costs selling general and administrative expenses increased 124 million or 76 for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources in the technical aspects of selling our products and 15 million of additional sharebased compensation expense 

 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

 

 

 

special charges 

 

patent portfolio license 

 

we entered into a patent portfolio license effective march 31 2009 with an unrelated thirdparty that covers both issued patents and patent applications and settled alleged infringement claims the total payment made to the thirdparty was 825 million 40 million of which was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and the remaining 425 million of which was recorded as a prepaid royalty that will be amortized over the life of the patents 

 

expenses associated with the abandonment of the atmel acquisition 

 

on october 2 2008 we and on semiconductor corporation announced that we had sent a proposal to the board of directors of atmel corporation to acquire atmel for 500 per share in cash or a total of approximately 23 billion on october 29 2008 atmel announced that its board of directors had determined that the unsolicited proposal was inadequate on december 15 2008 we delivered a written notification to atmel regarding a proposed alternate slate of directors to be elected at atmel’s 2009 annual meeting on february 10 2009 we announced our termination of our consideration of a potential transaction with atmel in light of the economic uncertainty and the lack of visibility with respect to atmel’s business not allowing us to put a value on atmel in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we expensed 16 million of various costs associated with the terminated proposal 

 

inprocess research and development 

 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we completed our acquisition of hampshire company a leader in the large format touch screen controller market as a result of the acquisition we incurred a 05 million inprocess research and development charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we completed the acquisition of hitech software a provider of software development tools and compilers as a result of the acquisition we incurred a 02 million inprocess research and development charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we completed our acquisition of re international a leader in developing innovative integrated circuits for smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and other lifesafety systems as a result of the acquisition we incurred a 02 million inprocess research and development charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

loss on sale of fab 3 

 

we received an unsolicited offer on our fab 3 facility in september 2007 we assessed our available capacity in our current facilities along with our capacity available from outside foundries and determined the capacity of fab 3 would not be required in the near term as a result of this assessment we accepted the offer on september 21 2007 and the transaction closed on october 19 2007 we received 275 million in cash net of expenses associated with the sale and recognized an impairment charge in fiscal 2008 of 268 million on the sale of fab 3 representing the difference between the carrying value of the assets at september 30 2007 and the amounts realized subsequent to september 30 2007 

 

other income expense 

 

interest income in fiscal 2009 decreased to 325 million from 549 million in fiscal 2008 interest income in fiscal 2008 decreased to 549 million from 584 million in fiscal 2007 the primary reason for the reductions in interest income in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was lower interest rates on our cash and investment balances interest expense in fiscal 2009 increased to 243 million from 80 million in fiscal 2008 interest expense increased to 80 million in fiscal 2008 from 54 million in fiscal 2007 the primary reason for the increases in interest expense in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was due to the 115 billion in 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures we issued in december 2007 other expenses net in fiscal 2009 was 44 million compared to other income net of 24 million in fiscal 2008 the increase in other expenses net was primarily related to a 73 million loss on trading securities in fiscal 2009 as a result of market fluctuations in our trading securities and put options as described in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements other income net was 24 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 03 million in fiscal 2007 the increase in other income net was primarily related to gains on sales of fixed assets and gains related to currency rate fluctuations 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax benefit was 49 in fiscal 2009 and our effective tax rate was 152 in fiscal 2008 and 110 in fiscal 2007 and is lower than statutory rates in the us due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations rd tax credits and export sales incentives our effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 reflects a 169 million us tax benefit related to our settlement with the irs for our fiscal 2005 tax audit and a 330 million tax reserve release associated with a favorable clarification of tax regulations combined these tax benefits reduced our effective tax rate by 21 percentage points to an effective tax benefit of 49 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 reflects a 103 million us tax benefit associated with the sale of fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 a 57 million tax benefit related to the release of tax reserves associated with a foreign tax matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 a 45 million tax benefit related to the release of tax reserves for certain international tax exposures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and approximately 08 million related to accrued interest and other reserve matters combined these tax benefits decreased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 by approximately 44 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 reflects a 522 million benefit related to a tax settlement for our fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2001 tax years that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which decreased our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 by 13 

 

 

 

various taxing authorities in the us and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 2004 2006 2007 and 2008 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the us and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

 

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future one of our thailand tax holidays expired in september 2006 and the expiration did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate any expiration of our tax holidays in thailand are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we had 14408 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2009 a decrease of 783 million from the march 31 2008 balance the decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities being offset by dividends and stock repurchase activity during the twelve months ended march 31 2009 

 

net cash provided from operating activities was 3087 million for fiscal 2009 4473 million for fiscal 2008 and 4298 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower net income in fiscal 2009 an increase in the purchases of trading securities and changes in accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 198 million for fiscal 2009 net cash provided by investing activities was 557 million for fiscal 2008 and net cash used in investing activities was 4422 million in fiscal 2007 the decrease in cash in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and investments in other assets the increase in cash in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments and cash proceeds from the sale of fab 3 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 3302 million for fiscal 2009 1827   million for fiscal 2008 and 3853 million for fiscal 2007 proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plans were 336 million for fiscal 2009 591 million for fiscal 2008 and 687 million for fiscal 2007 we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of 2467 million in fiscal 2009 2520 million in fiscal 2008 and 2079 million in fiscal 2007 excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements were 68 million in fiscal 2009 212 million in fiscal 2008 and 228 million in fiscal 2007 during the year ended march 31 2008 we received net proceeds of 11270 million from the issuance of our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 1239 million in fiscal 2009 and 11380 million in fiscal 2008 no amounts were expended in fiscal 2007 for the repurchase of our common stock during fiscal 2007 we paid down 2690 million in shortterm borrowings to complete the repatriation of 500 million in fiscal 2006 we initiated the 2690 million in borrowings which were collateralized against investments that were held in foreign locations allowing the investments to reach their normal maturity date 

 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 1024 million in fiscal 2009 698 million in fiscal 2008 and 600 million in fiscal 2007 capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 150 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

 

we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

  

 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2009 we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

 

on october 23 2006 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2009 no shares related to this authorization remained available for purchase under this program on december 11 2007 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2009 2460002 shares related to this authorization remained available for purchase 

 

our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 21500000 shares of our common stock concurrent with our junior subordinated convertible debentures transaction described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and no further shares are available to be repurchased under this authorization 

 

as of march 31 2009 approximately 360 million shares of our common stock remained as treasury shares with the balance of the repurchased shares being used to fund share issuance requirements under our equity incentive plans the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon market conditions interest rates and corporate considerations 

 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock during fiscal 2007 we paid dividends in the amount of 0965 per share for a total dividend payment of 2079 million during fiscal 2008 we paid dividends in the amount of 1205 per share for a total dividend payment of 2520 million during fiscal 2009 we paid dividends in the amount of 1346 per share for a total dividend payment of 2467 million on may 7 2009 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0339 per share which will be paid on june 4 2009 to stockholders of record on may 21 2009 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be approximately 620 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for acquisitions or other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2009 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on microchip and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51 sfas no 160 sfas no 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas no 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 160 will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of fasb statement no 133 sfas no 161 the standard requires additional quantitative disclosures provided in tabular form and qualitative disclosures for derivative instruments the required disclosures include how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows relative volume of derivative activity the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments the accounting treatment for those derivative instruments formally designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge relationship and the existence and nature of creditrelated contingent features for derivatives sfas no 161 was effective for us beginning january 1 2009 sfas no 161 did not change the accounting treatment for derivative instruments and as such the adoption of sfas no 161 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in may 2008 the fasb released fsp apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 141 that alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements fsp apb 141 will impact the accounting associated with our 115 billion junior subordinated convertible debentures fsp apb 141 specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods and will require us to recognize additional noncash interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature furthermore fsp apb 141 would require us to recognize interest expense in prior periods pursuant to retrospective accounting treatment fsp apb 141 will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and was adopted by us on april 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the magnitude of the impact of adoption of fsp apb 141 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in june 2008 the eitf issued eitf 0705 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entitys own stock eitf no 0705 eitf no 0705 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entitys own stock which would qualify as a scope exception under sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities eitf no 0705 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of eitf no 0705 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in november 2008 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 087 accounting for defensive intangible assets eitf no 087 eitf no 087 applies to defensive intangible assets which are acquired intangible assets that the acquirer does not intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them as these assets are separately identifiable eitf no 087 requires an acquiring entity to account for defensive intangible assets as a separate unit of accounting defensive intangible assets must be recognized at fair value in accordance with sfas no 141r and sfas no 157 eitf no 087 is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2010 because eitf no 087 is applicable to future transactions we do not believe the adoption of eitf no 087 will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242  this fsp changes existing guidance for determining whether an impairment of debt securities is other than temporary the fsp requires otherthantemporary impairments to be separated into the amount representing the decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from a security referred to as credit losses which is recognized in earnings and the amount related to other factors which is recognized in other comprehensive income this noncredit loss component of the impairment may only be classified in other comprehensive income if the holder of the security concludes that it does not intend to sell and it will not more likely than not be required to sell the security before it recovers its value if these conditions are not met the noncredit loss must also be recognized in earnings when adopting the fsp an entity is required to record a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized otherthantemporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june 15 2009 our management is currently evaluating the requirements of the fsp and has not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp fas 1574 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp fas 1574 this fsp provides additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability the fsp also provides additional guidance on circumstances that may indicate that a transaction is not orderly fsp fas 1574 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june 15 2009 we do not believe the adoption of this fsp will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 interim disclosure about fair value of financial instruments fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 amends sfas no 107 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements the fsp also amends apb opinion no 28 interim financial reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 we are currently evaluating the potential impact if any of the adoption of fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 on our consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities and money market funds that we hold on an availableforsale basis totaled 13183 million and our trading securities totaled 1225 million as of march 31 2009 and 14894 million and 296 million respectively as of march 31 2008 the availableforsale securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 

 

 

at march 31 2009 568 million of original purchase value of our investment portfolio was invested in ars historically the carrying value of ars approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates if an auction fails for amounts we have invested our investment will not be liquid with the continuing liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions in september 2007 and february 2008 auctions for 249 million and 348 million respectively of the original purchase value of our investments in ars had failed while we continue to earn interest on these investments based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices the estimated market value for a portion of these ars no longer approximates the original purchase value 

 

at march 31 2009 the 249 million of ars that failed during september 2007 carried ratings between a and b by standard  poors compared to ratings between aaa and aa at march 31 2008 all but 25 million of the securities possess credit enhancement in the form of insurance for principal and interest the underlying characteristics of 224 million of these ars relate to servicing statutory requirements in the life insurance industry and 25 million relate to a specialty finance company whose counterparty rating was downgraded to baa1 by moody’s during december 2008 moody’s also downgraded the 25 million specialty finance company issue we own to caa3 during december 2008 additionally moody’s downgraded 75 million of the 224 million of ars related to servicing statutory requirements in the life insurance industry from aa3 to baa1 during the quarter ending december 31 2008 during the first week of january 2009 moody’s downgraded other securities from the same issuer of the 75 million ars which we do not own to d and simultaneously cited their expectation that the series owned by us would have interest payment shortfalls but that any shortfalls would be paid by the insurer and the ratings on the notes would then become based on the rating of the insurer the issuer announced a default as expected in early january 2009 and interest has continuously been paid by the insurer and posted to our account since that time all rating change actions have been factored into our fair value estimates for the period ending march 31 2009 

 

the 249 million in failed auctions have continued to fail through the filing date of this report as a result we will not be able to access such funds until a future auction on these investments is successful the fair value of the failed ars has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions based on the estimated values we concluded these investments were other than temporarily impaired and recognized impairment charges on these investments of 24 million during fiscal 2008 and 36 million during fiscal 2009 if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate further we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an additional impairment charge to earnings 

 

 

 

the 348 million of ars that failed during february 2008 are investments in student loanbacked ars approximately 02 million 17 million and 10 million of these ars were redeemed at par by the issuers during the first second and third quarters of fiscal 2009 respectively reducing our overall position to 319 million based upon our evaluation of available information we believe these investments are of high credit quality as all of the investments carry aaa credit ratings by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are largely backed by the federal government federal family education loan program the fair value of the failed ars has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions however if the issuers are not able to successfully close future auctions or over time are not able to obtain more favorable financing options for their debt issuance needs including refinancing these obligations into lower rate securities the market value of these investments could be negatively impacted 

 

in november 2008 we executed an ars rights agreement the rights with the broker through which we purchased the 319 million in ars that provides 1 us with the right to put these ars back to the broker at par anytime during the period from june 30 2010 through july 2 2012 and 2 the broker with the right to purchase or sell the ars at par on our behalf anytime through july 2 2012 we accounted for the acceptance of the rights as the receipt of a put option for no consideration and recognized a gain with a corresponding recognition as a longterm investment we elected to measure the rights under the fair value option of sfas no 159 and will record changes in the fair value of the rights in earnings we simultaneously recognized an otherthantemporary impairment loss of 55 million as we no longer intend to hold these ars until the fair value recovers which was recorded in other comprehensive loss in prior quarters we reclassified the ars from availableforsale to trading securities and future changes in fair value are being recorded in earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we estimated the fair value of the ars increased by 15 million offset by a change in the fair value of the related rights of 15 million with no net impact to our income statement we expect any future changes in the fair value of the ars to continue to be largely offset by changes in the fair value of the related rights without any significant net impact to our income statement we will continue to measure the ars and the rights at fair value utilizing level 3 fair value inputs until the earlier of its maturity or exercise 

 

we continue to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of our investments if the market conditions deteriorate further we may be required to record additional impairment charges we intend and have the ability to hold these ars until the market recovers or as it relates to the 319 million of par value of these ars until june 30 2010 when we have the right to sell the securities at par to the broker we do not anticipate having to sell these securities to fund the operation of our business we believe that based on our current unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or ability to fund our operations 

 

our investment in marketable equity securities at march 31 2009 consists of shares of common stock the value of which is determined by the closing price of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of the balance sheet date these investments are classified as trading securities and accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the market value of these investments was approximately 795 million at march 31 2009 compared to our cost basis of approximately 855 million the value of our investment in marketable equity securities would be materially impacted if there were a significant change in the market price of the shares a hypothetical 30 favorable or unfavorable change in the stock prices compared to the stock prices at march 31 2009 would have affected the value of our investments in marketable equity securities by approximately 239 million additionally we have sold put options on some of our trading securities which are recorded as accrued liabilities and are marked to market value a decline in the stock price of the underlying security prior to the expiration date of the puts would cause an increase to the liability which would result in a charge to our results of operations and could result in the put being exercised by the holder if the put is exercised by the holder we could be required to pay up to 110 million for additional shares of common stock at a price potentially in excess of the then fair market value of the common stock a hypothetical 30 unfavorable change in the stock price of the trading security on which we have sold the puts compared to the stock price at march 31 2009 could potentially result in the puts being exercised and would result in our paying 110 million to acquire the shares of common stock the stock would then be marked to market value affecting the value of our investment by approximately 21 million see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our investments in marketable equity securities 

 

we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been material to our operating results approximately 99 of our sales are denominated in us dollars we maintain hedges related to the net of our asset and liability foreign currency exposure as needed as of march 31 2009 there were no foreign currency derivatives outstanding compared to 24 million of foreign currency derivatives outstanding as of march 31 2008 if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates at march 31 2009 the effect on our financial position and results of operation would be immaterial 

 

 

 

during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to interest rate movements foreign currency fluctuations and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future the recent decline in general economic conditions and fluctuations in the global credit and equity markets may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders of 

microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries 

 

we have audited microchip technology incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria microchip technology incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board us those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion microchip technology incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2009 based on the coso criteria  

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board us the march 31 2009 consolidated financial statements of microchip technology incorporated and our report dated may 28  2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

industry background 

 

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and various analog and interface products 

 

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market at approximately 14 billion in calendar year 2007 microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures 4bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive but they generally lack the minimum functionality required in most applications and are typically used in relatively simple applications 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of high volume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications 

 

many of the microcontrollers shipped today are rombased and must be programmed by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing resulting in long lead times based on market conditions for delivery of such microcontrollers in addition to delayed product introduction these long lead times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required to address these issues we offer programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the customer’s manufacturing line thus significantly reducing lead time and inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur while these microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to rombased microcontrollers manufacturing technology has evolved over time to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over rombased microcontrollers thus providing significant value to microcontroller customers as a result reprogrammable microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller market 

 

our products 

 

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

 

microcontrollers 

 

we offer a broad family of microcontroller products featuring our unique proprietary architecture marketed under the pic ® brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 6 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our pic products are designed for applications requiring fieldprogrammability high performance low power and cost effectiveness they feature a variety of memory technology configurations low voltage and power small footprint and ease of use our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set computer referred to as risc and variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative singlebus complex instruction set computer architectures referred to as cisc with over 550 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit 16bit and 32bit microcontroller markets 

 

digital signal controllers dsc are a subset of our 16bit microcontroller offering our dspic ®   digital signal controller families integrate the control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of digital signal processors dsps along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic digital signal controllers enlarge our addressable market 

 

 

 

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced low cost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

 

development tools 

 

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic digital signal controllers for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

 

our family of development tools operates in the standard windows ® environment on standard pc hardware these tools range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation hardware customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our systems share the same integrated development environment 

 

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are more than 190 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

 

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped more than 600000 development tools 

 

analog and interface products 

 

our analog and interface products consist of several families with over 500 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management and interface products at the end of fiscal 2008 our mixedsignal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 13400 end customers 

 

we continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy as well as to new customers in addition to our “attach” strategy we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

 

memory products 

 

our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory referred to as serial eeproms we sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide serial eeprom products are used for nonvolatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods serial eeproms have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small devices 

 

manufacturing 

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wafer fabrication 

 

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 to 50 microns during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 fab 2 operated at approximately 99 of its capacity operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing 

 

we acquired fab 4 in august 2002 and began production on october 31 2003 fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 035 to 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns a significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment acquired with fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand 

 

in september 2007 we received an unsolicited offer on our fab 3 facility located in puyallup washington we assessed our available capacity in our current facilities along with our capacity available from outside foundries and determined the capacity of fab 3 would not be required in the near term as a result of this assessment we accepted the purchase offer to sell fab 3 on september 21 2007 and the transaction closed on october 19 2007 we received 275 million in cash net of expenses associated with the sale and recognized an impairment charge of 268 million on the sale of fab 3 representing the difference between the carrying value of the assets at september 30 2007 and the amounts realized subsequent to september 30 2007 

 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

 

we outsource a small percentage of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities 

 

assembly and test 

 

we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand as of march 31 2008 approximately 67 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2008 our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

 

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

 

at the end of fiscal 2008 we owned longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment in the united states amounting to 4006 million and 1217 million in other countries including 1131 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2007 we owned longlived assets in the united states amounting to 4887 million and 1170 million in other countries including 1146 million in thailand 

  

  

 

research and development rd 

 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers serial eeprom memory analog and interface products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

 

in fiscal 2008 our rd expenses were 1209   million compared to 1137   million in fiscal 2007 and 949 million in fiscal 2006 rd expenses included 107 million in fiscal 2008 and 96 million in fiscal 2007 of sharebased compensation as a result of the adoption of fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas no 123r 

 

sales and distribution 

 

general 

 

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

 

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

 

distribution 

 

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

 

in fiscal 2008 we derived 64 of our net sales through distributors and 36 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip in fiscal 2007 and 2006 we derived 65 of our net sales through distributors and 35 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip our largest distributor accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 our second largest distributor accounted for approximately 7 of our net sales in fiscal 2008   10 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 in february 2008 we terminated our relationship with arrow electronics in north america and europe arrow electronics in australia and new zealand remain as our only arrow electronics franchised distributor locations worldwide in february 2008 we also entered into a new demand creation relationship with avnetmemec in north america avnetsilica in europe and an expanded demand creation relationship with future electronics worldwide 

 

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

sales by geography 

 

sales by geography for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 in each of fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

our international sales are predominately us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in recent periods weakness in the us housing market and general economic conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

 

backlog 

 

as of april 30 2008 our backlog was approximately 2257 million compared to 1854 million as of april 30 2007 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

 

competition 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products furthermore capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position 

 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

we maintain a portfolio of united states and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2008 and 2026 we also have numerous additional united states and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

 

 

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

 

environmental regulation 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 

 

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of or to adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

 

employees 

 

as of march 31 2008 we had 4811 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend 

 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability 

 

our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

  

  

 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins 

 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results may suffer 

 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 

 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog products 

 

we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

  

  

 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

 

sales through distributors accounted for approximately 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and 65 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2007 and 2006 our largest distributor accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 our two largest distributors accounted for approximately 19 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advance notice 

 

on february 4 2008 we terminated our distributor arrow electronics and announced that we had partnered with avnet electronics marketing and future electronics to provide our global distribution services we believe that these two global distributors combined with our regional and specialty distributor partners will have a positive longterm impact in supporting the technical and commercial support needs of our customers our net sales of product sold by arrow electronics in the year ended march 31 2008 represented approximately 7 of our net sales although we do not believe the termination of arrow electronics will have a material adverse impact on our net sales there can be no assurance as to what the longterm or shortterm impact on us will be as a result of these recent actions 

 

during fiscal 2006 we reduced the gross margin that certain of our distributors earn when they sell our products we reduced these distributors’ gross margins because we believed these distributors did not have sufficient technical sales resources to properly address the marketplace for our products since fiscal 2006 we have added over 150 technical sales employees and added new regional distributors throughout our worldwide sales organization to address the support requirements for both our oem and distribution customers although these actions have not had a material adverse impact on the overall effectiveness of our distribution channel there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse impact in the future 

 

during an industry andor economic downturn it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sellthrough by our distributors the decline in sellthrough of our products by loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given period and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 

 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel is intense 

 

we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team as a result of the anticipated impact that the adoption of sfas no 123r in our first fiscal quarter of 2007 would have on our results of operations we changed our equity compensation program during fiscal 2006 we now grant fewer equitybased shares per employee and the type of equity instrument is generally restricted stock units rather than stock options this change in our equity compensation program may make it more difficult for us to attract or retain qualified management and engineering personnel which could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

 

 

we are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us 

 

we use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption further procurement of required products and services from third parties is done by purchase order and contracts if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

 

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however fluctuations in our overall business in certain recent periods and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclically by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

 

  we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our product line or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in value of inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the performance or use of our products these claims may be due to products nonconformance to our specifications or specifications agreed upon with the customer changes in our manufacturing processes and unexpected end customer system issues due to the interaction with our products or insufficient design or testing by our customers we could incur significant expenses related to such matters including costs related to writing off the value of inventory of defective products recalling defective products providing support services product replacements or modification to products the defense of such claims diversion of resources from other projects lost revenue or delay in recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders and unpaid receivables customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements and a requirement to pay damages 

 

 

 

because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell these expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have product liability insurance but we do not expect that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of their systems could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to customer claims if our products or interactions with our products cause the system failures we will face increased exposure to customer claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures caused by our products 

 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us 

 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers 

 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we have approximately 60000 end customers and our ten largest customers made up approximately 9 of our total revenue for the year ended march 31 2008 cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits 

 

further as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale under these contracts we commit to supply quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates if we become unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or quality related issues under these contracts we may be liable for the costs the customer has incurred while we try to limit such liabilities if they should arise there may be a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

 

business interruptions could harm our business 

 

operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure fire earthquake floods or other natural disasters if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis if this occurs we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers in addition business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2008 approximately 75 of our net sales were made to foreign customers during fiscal 2007 approximately 74 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand which has experienced periods of political uncertainty in the past we also use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency could impact our operating results we use forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease andor our operating results could suffer 

 

a portion of our shortterm investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities recent auctions for these securities have failed and our investment in these securities is not liquid if the issuer is unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit rating deteriorates we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of our investment through an impairment charge to earnings 

 

at march 31 2008 597 million of our investment portfolio was invested in auction rate securities historically the carrying value of auction rate securities approximated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates if an auction fails for amounts we have invested our investment will not be liquid with the recent liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets our auction rate securities have experienced multiple failed auctions in september 2007 and february 2008 auctions for 249 million and 348 million respectively of the original purchase value of our investments in auction rate securities had failed while we earn interest on these investments based on a predetermined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes the estimated market value for a portion of these auction rate securities no longer approximates the original purchase value 

 

the 249 million in failed auctions during september 2007 are all either aa or aaa rated by standard  poors and all but 25 million of the securities possesses credit enhancement in the form of insurance for principal and interest the underlying characteristics of 224 million of these auction rate securities relate to servicing statutory requirements in the life insurance industry and 25 million relate to a specialty finance company that has a aaa rating from standard  poors and the issue we own has a aa rating from standard  poors the 249 million in failed auctions have continued to fail through may 23 2008 as a result we will not be able to access such funds until a future auction on these investments is successful the fair value of the failed auction rate securities has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions based on the estimated values we concluded these investments were other than temporarily impaired and recognized an impairment charge on these investments of 24 million during fiscal 2008 if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or if their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the investments through an impairment charge to earnings 

 

the 348 million in failed auctions during february 2008 are investments in student loanbacked municipal bond auction rate securities based upon our evaluation of available information we believe these investments are of high credit quality as all of the investments carry at least two aaa credit ratings and are largely backed by the federal government federal family education loan program the fair value of the failed auction rate securities has been estimated based on market information and estimates determined by management and could change significantly based on market conditions 

 

we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of our investments if the market conditions deteriorate further we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges we intend and have the ability to hold these auction rate securities until the market recovers as we do not anticipate having to sell these securities to fund the operations of our business we believe that based on our current unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities balances the current lack of liquidity in the markets for auction rate securities will not have a material impact on our liquidity cash flow or our ability to fund our operations 

  

  

interruptions in information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption including but not limited to computer viruses security breaches or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results we have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions but such disruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial results in addition we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some risks and obligations in these circumstances we have determined that it is more cost effective to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the increased premium costs in place since the disruption in the insurance market after the events of september 11 2001 the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects political risks and patent infringement should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition result of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our products and manufacturing process our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or a cessation of operations such environmental regulations have required us in the past and could require us in the future to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities 

 

over the past few years there has been an expansion in environmental laws focusing on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products for example the eu rohs directive provided that beginning july 1 2006 electronic products sold into europe were required to meet stringent chemical restrictions including the absence of lead other countries such as the united states china and korea have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to those of the eu these and other future environmental regulations could require us to reengineer certain of our existing products and may make it more expensive for us to manufacture and sell our products over the last several years the number and complexity of laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories the recycling of electronic products and the reduction in quantity and the recycling of packaging materials have expanded significantly it may be difficult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant materials to meet customers’ needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability we may also have to write off inventory in the event that we hold inventory that is not saleable as a result of changes to regulations we expect these trends to continue in addition we anticipate increased customer requirements to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of hazardous substances in our products and energy efficiency measures 

 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states through exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions’ export regulations our us manufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to export administration regulations “ear” when exported and reexported to and from all international jurisdictions licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain countries noncompliance with the ear or other export regulations can result in penalties including denial of export privileges fines criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business including our ability to meet our net sales and earnings targets 

 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities for fiscal year 2002 and later we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

  

  

 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our common stock 

 

in the event we make acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits 

 

while acquisitions do not represent a major part of our growth strategy from time to time we may consider strategic acquisitions if such opportunities arise any transactions that we complete may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired business or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process in addition we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies 

 

we have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 

 

as a result of our sale of 115 billion of 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures in december 2007 we have a substantially greater amount of longterm debt than we have maintained in the past our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may need or desire to refinance all or a portion of our debentures or any other future indebtedness that we incur on or before the maturity of the debentures there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

 

conversion of our debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders including holders who had previously converted their debentures 

 

the conversion of some or all of our outstanding debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the debentures upon conversion we may satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash shares of common stock or any combination at our option if upon conversion we elect to deliver cash for the lesser of the conversion value and principal amount of the debentures we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock if the conversion value of a debenture exceeds the principal amount of the debenture we may also elect to deliver in cash in lieu of common stock for the conversion value in excess of one thousand dollars principal amount conversion spread there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash the conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the debentures into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

there will likely be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 

 

there will likely be potential new accounting pronouncements of regulatory rulings which may have an adverse impact on our future financial condition and results of operations for example in may 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 141  that alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt that allows for either mandatory or optional cash settlements including our outstanding debentures the fsp requires the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost 

 

  

  

further the fsp will require bifurcation of a component of the debt classification of that component as equity and then accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to result in the “economic interest cost” being reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in issuing this fsp the fasb emphasized that the fsp will be applied to the terms of the instruments as they exited for the time periods existed therefore the application of the fsp would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will require retrospective application we will be required to implement the proposed standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 which begins on april 1 2009 although fsp apb 141 will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows it would require us to record a significant amount of noncash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized in addition if our convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity any unamortized debt discount would result in a loss on extinguishment as a result there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and earnings per share these impacts could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of our debentures

we own a 67174 square foot building in bangalore india which is used for research and development marketing support and other administrative functions 

 

in addition to the facilities we own we lease several research and development facilities and sales offices in north america europe and asia our aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately 05 million 

 

we currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our production requirements for the next 12 months 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them on april 18 2008 lsi logic and its wholly owned subsidiary agere filed both an action with the international trade commission and a complaint in the eastern district of texas alleging patent infringement by microchip and 17 other semiconductor and foundry companies these actions seek monetary damages and injunctive relief against the allegedly infringing products due to the very early stage of these proceedings the outcome of these actions is not presently determinable and therefore we can make no assessment of their 

  

  

 

materiality microchip intends to vigorously defend its rights in these matters we periodically receive notification from various third parties alleging patent infringment of patents intellectual property rights or other matters with respect to these and other pending legal actions to which we are a party although the outcome of these actions is not presently determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future

introduction 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 1 – business” “item 6 – selected financial data” and “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

 

 

we begin our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of microchip’s overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 30 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements” 

 

strategy 

 

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices interface devices serial eeproms and our patented k ee l oq   security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

 

we sell our products to a broad base of domestic and international customers across a variety of industries the principal markets that we serve include consumer automotive industrial office automation and telecommunications our business is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions within these markets the recent weakness in the us housing market and general economic conditions have adversely impacted our net sales to customers in the markets we serve 

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit margin 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

 

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

our discussion and analysis of microchip’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition sharebased compensation inventories investments income taxes property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment junior subordinated convertible debentures and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

 

revenue recognition  distributors 

 

our distributors worldwide generally have broad price protection and product return rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customer revenue is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an enduser at which time the sales price becomes fixed or determinable revenue is not recognized upon shipment to our distributors since due to discounts from list price as well as price protection rights the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time   at the time of shipment to these distributors we record a trade receivable for the selling price as there is a legally enforceable right to payment relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and record the gross margin in deferred income on shipments to distributors on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

deferred income on shipments to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor however the amount of gross margin that we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of credits granted to distributors on specifically identified products and customers to allow the distributors to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers and price protection concessions related to market pricing conditions 

 

we sell the majority of the items in our product catalog to our distributors worldwide at a uniform list price however distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points the majority of our distributors’ resales require a reduction from the original list price paid often under these circumstances we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed in the form of a credit against the distributors’ outstanding accounts receivable balance the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information to us regarding the sale to their end customer the price reductions vary significantly based on the customer product quantity ordered geographic location and other factors and discounts to a price less than our cost have historically been rare the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers thus a portion of the “deferred income on shipments to distributors” balance represents the amount of distributors’ original purchase price that will be credited back to the distributor in the future the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred income on shipments to distributors account that will be credited back to the distributors therefore we do not reduce deferred income on shipments to distributors or accounts receivable by anticipated future concessions rather price concessions are typically recorded against deferred income on shipments to distributors and accounts receivable when incurred which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product at march 31 2008 we had approximately 1304 million of deferred revenue and 350 million in deferred cost of sales recognized as 954 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors at march 31 2007 we had approximately 1264 million of deferred revenue and 350 million of deferred cost of sales recognized as 914 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors the deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our income statement will be lower than the amount reflected on the balance sheet due to additional price credits to be granted to the distributors when the product is sold to their customers these additional price credits historically have resulted in the deferred income approximating the overall gross margins that we recognize in the distribution channel of our business 

 

 

 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no immediate revenue impact from the price protection as it is reflected as a reduction of the deferred income on shipments to distributors’ balance 

 

products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to our consolidated results of operations we routinely evaluate the risk of impairment of the deferred cost of sales component of the deferred income on shipments to distributors account because of the historically immaterial amounts of inventory that have been scrapped and historically rare instances where discounts given to a distributor result in a price less than our cost we believe the deferred costs are approximately recorded at their carrying value 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we adopted sfas no 123r which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2008 was 334 million of which 267 million was reflected in operating expenses and 62 million was reflected in cost of goods sold total sharebased compensation which was included in inventory at march 31 2008 was 38 million 

 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholes model also require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after april 1 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2008 was immaterial 

 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions had we adopted sfas no 123r in prior periods the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of sfas no 123 assuming the application of the blackscholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

inventories 

 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

 

 

 

investments 

 

we classify our investments as trading securities or availableforsale securities based upon management’s intent with regard to the investments and the nature of the underlying securities 

 

our trading securities consist of strategic investments in shares of publicly traded common stock and restricted cash representing cash collateral for put options we have sold on one of our trading securities our investments in trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other income net 

 

our availableforsale investments consist of government agency bonds municipal bonds auction rate securities ars and corporate bonds our investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related availableforsale security dividend and interest income are recognized when earned the cost of securities sold is calculated using the specific identification method 

 

we include within our shortterm investments our trading securities as well as our income yielding availableforsale securities that can be readily converted to cash and includes within longterm investments those income yielding availableforsale securities with maturities of over one year that have unrealized losses attributable to them we have the ability to hold our longterm investments until such time as these assets are no longer impaired such recovery is not expected to occur within the next year 

 

due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on certain of the our investment portfolio of ars we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values including assessments of counterparty credit quality default risk underlying the security discount rates and overall capital market liquidity the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict factors that may impact our ars valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities rates of default of the underlying assets underlying collateral value discount rates counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 

 

the credit markets continued to deteriorate in the second half of fiscal 2008 if uncertainties in these markets continue these markets deteriorate further or we experiences any additional ratings downgrades on any investments in our portfolio including our ars we may incur additional impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively affect our financial condition cash flow and reported earnings 

 

income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2008 our gross deferred tax asset was 633 million 

 

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the united states internal revenue service “irs” for our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

  

 

property plant  equipment 

 

property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred at march 31 2008 the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled 5223 million which represents 208 of our total assets this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30 years on buildings 

 

we began production activities at fab 4 on october 31 2003 we began to depreciate the fab 4 assets as they were placed in service for production purposes as of march 31 2008 all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service all manufacturing equipment that was not being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management believes there will be no change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into productive service the lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets 

 

the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations could result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

 

impairment of property plant and equipment 

 

we assess whether indicators of impairment of longlived assets are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value if less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset we may incur impairment losses or additional losses on already impaired assets in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 

 

junior subordinated convertible debentures 

 

we account for our junior subordinated convertible debentures and related provisions in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force issue eitf no 985 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 0027 application of issue no 985 to certain convertible instruments eitf no 0019 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock eitf no 016 the meaning of “indexed to a company’s own stock” and eitf no 0408 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earn we also evaluate the instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments and measurement of fair value of accounting purposes eitf no 0408 requires us to include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding junior subordinated convertible debentures in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent conversion feature has been met we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and current ability to settle the principal amount of the junior subordinated convertible debentures in cash this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion price per share which was 3381 at march 31 2008 and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future 

litigation 

 

our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss recorded reserves were immaterial at march 31 2008 

 

because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on our pending litigation we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially affect our results of operation and financial position 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 

 

net sales 

 

we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral in certain circumstances a customers financial condition may require collateral and in such cases the collateral would be provided primarily by letters of credit 

 

our net sales of 10357 million in fiscal 2008 decreased by 39 million or 04 over fiscal 2007 and net sales of 10397 million in fiscal 2007 increased by 1118 million or 120 over fiscal 2006 the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve particularly the housing and consumer markets the increase in net sales in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from increased demand predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller and analog products average selling prices for our products were down approximately 3 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and were flat in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the number of units of our products sold was up approximately 3 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and up approximately 12 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years key factors in achieving the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

  

  

microcontrollers 

 

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 804 of our total net sales in fiscal 2008 approximately 802 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 and approximately 793 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 

 

net sales of our microcontroller products decreased approximately 02 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and increased approximately 133 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 resulted primarily from adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve particularly the housing and consumer markets the increase in net sales in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets driven principally by market share gains and those factors described above under “net sales” at page 30 the end markets that we serve include the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing control markets 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

memory products 

 

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 116 of our total net sales in fiscal 2008 approximately 118 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 and approximately 135 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 

 

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 20 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased approximately 21 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales 

 

serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

analog and interface products 

 

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 80 of our total net sales in fiscal 2008 approximately 80 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 and approximately 72 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 

 

net sales of our analog and interface products were essentially flat in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and increased approximately 245 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 the changes in net sales of our analog and interface products in these periods were driven primarily by economic conditions market share gains and supply and demand conditions within the analog and interface market 

 

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than half of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products will increase over time 

 

distribution 

 

distributors accounted for 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 and 65 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2007 and 2006 

 

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 our two largest distributors together accounted for 19 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 

  

  

 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and either party may terminate the relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

at march 31 2008 distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 18 months of inventory of our products calculated based on the prior three months of their sellthrough activity over the past three fiscal years the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 18 months and 25 months thus inventory levels at our distributors are at the low end of the range we have experienced over the last three years we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sellthrough for all of our distributors 

 

sales by geography 

 

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales in fiscal 2008 approximately 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and approximately 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

 

gross profit 

 

our gross profit was 6249 million in fiscal 2008 6248 million in fiscal 2007 and 5509 million in fiscal 2006 gross profit as a percent of sales was 603 in fiscal 2008 601 in fiscal 2007 and 594 in fiscal 2006 

 

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit over the past three fiscal years were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 we operated at approximately 99 of our fab 2 capacity during fiscal 2006 we operated at approximately 98 of our fab 2 capacity our utilization of fab 4’s total capacity is at relatively low levels although we are utilizing all of the installed equipment base we expect to maintain the current level of capacity utilization at fab 2 during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and to modestly increase the current level of capacity utilization at fab 4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 

  

  

 

the process technologies utilized impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes at march 31 2008 fab 4 predominantly utilized our 035 to 05 micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

 

our overall inventory levels were 1245 million at march 31 2008 compared to 1210 million at march 31 2007 and 1150 million at march 31 2006 we maintained 112 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2008 compared to 107 days of inventory at march 31 2007 and 106 days at march 31 2006 

 

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption capacity utilization levels particularly those at fab 4 and competitive and economic conditions 

 

at march 31 2008 approximately 67 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 72 as of march 31 2007 and approximately 66 at march 31 2006 contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility over the last three fiscal years we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication requirements 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our third party contractors our future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

 

research and development rd 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2008 were 1209 million or 117 of sales compared to 1137 million or 109 of sales for fiscal 2007 and 949 million or 102 of sales for fiscal 2006 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position rd costs are expensed as incurred assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

 

rd expenses increased 72 million or 63 for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal rd headcount and 11 million of additional sharebased compensation expense rd expenses increased 188 million or 198 for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 were higher labor and recruitment costs as a result of expanding our technical resources and 96 million of sharebased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 were 1756   million or 169 of sales compared to 1632 million or 157 of sales for fiscal 2007 and 1296 million or 140 of sales for fiscal 2006 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 124   million or 76 for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources involved in the technical aspects of selling our products and 15 million of additional sharebased compensation expense selling general and administrative expenses increased 337 million or 260 for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources in the technical aspects of selling our products and 145 million of sharebased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

 

 

 

special charge  loss on sale of fab 3 

 

in august 2002 we acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in gresham oregon referred to as fab 4 after the acquisition of fab 4 was completed we undertook an analysis of the potential production capacity at fab 4 the results of the production capacity analysis led us to determine that fab 3’s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we committed to a plan to sell fab 3 accordingly fab 3 was classified as an asset heldforsale as of december 31 2002 and we maintained that classification until march 31 2005 

 

on march 31 2005 we changed the classification of fab 3 from an asset heldforsale to an asset heldforfutureuse and began to depreciate the asset fab 3 had been on the market for over two years and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility over that period of time our business had increased significantly and we thought that over the next several years we would need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of fab 4’s clean room capacity was utilized we determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing the fab 3 facility and hold it for future use as a result of this change in classification we had to assess the fair value of the fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification from heldforsale to heldforfutureuse under sfas no 144 we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the asset the discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of the fab 3 asset at march 31 2005 was not in excess of its fair value no indicators of impairment for the fab 3 asset arose between march 31 2005 and september 30 2007 

 

we received an unsolicited offer on the fab 3 facility in september 2007 we assessed our available capacity in our current facilities along with our capacity available from outside foundries and determined the capacity of fab 3 would not be required in the near term as a result of this assessment we accepted the offer to sell fab 3 on september 21 2007 and the transaction closed on october 19 2007 we received 275 million in cash net of expenses associated with the sale and recognized an impairment charge of 268 million on the sale of fab 3 representing the difference between the carrying value of the assets at september 30 2007 and the amounts realized subsequent to september 30 2007 

 

there were no special charges in fiscal 2007 or 2006 

 

other income expense 

 

interest income in fiscal 2008 decreased to 549 million from 584 million in fiscal 2007 as the average interest rates on our invested cash balances were at lower levels during fiscal 2008 interest income in fiscal 2007 increased to 584 million from 328 million in fiscal 2006 as our average invested balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and we earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances interest expense in fiscal 2008 increased to 80 million from 54 million in fiscal 2007 due to the 115 billion in 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures we issued in december 2007 interest expense in fiscal 2007 increased to 54 million from 20 million in fiscal 2006 due to the shortterm debt balances that were outstanding

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate was 152 in fiscal 2008 110 in fiscal 2007 and 325 in fiscal 2006 and is lower than statutory rates in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations rd tax credits and export sales incentives our effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 reflects a 103 million us tax benefit associated with the sale of fab 3 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 a 57 million tax benefit related to the release of tax reserves associated with a foreign tax matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 a 45 million tax benefit related to the release of tax reserves for certain international tax exposures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and approximately 08 million related to accrued interest and other reserve matters combined these tax benefits decreased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 by approximately 44 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 reflects a 522 million benefit related to a tax settlement for our fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2001 tax years that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which decreased our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 by 13 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 reflects a 306 million tax expense related to the repatriation of 500 million of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act the “jobs act” that was effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 by 85 we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be approximately 182 

 

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

 

 

 

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future one of our thailand tax holidays expired in september 2006 and the expiration did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate any expiration of our tax holidays in thailand are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we had 15191 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2008 an increase of 2407 million from the march 31 2007 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to cash generated by operating activities and cash received from the issuance of our junior subordinated convertible debentures being offset in part by dividends and stock repurchase activity during the twelve months ended march 31 2008 

 

net cash provided from operating activities was 4473 million for fiscal 2008 4298 million for fiscal 2007 and 4373 million for fiscal 2006 the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to changes in accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities 

 

net cash provided by investing activities was 557 million for fiscal 2008 net cash used in investing activities was 4422 million for fiscal 2007 and 1366 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of investments and cash proceeds from the sale of fab 3 the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm and longterm investments 

 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 698 million in fiscal 2008 600 million in fiscal 2007 and 763 million in fiscal 2006 the primary reason for the dollar differences in capital expenditures in the periods covered by this report related to requirements for funding capital expansion activities in our manufacturing operations we currently intend to spend approximately 100 million during the next twelve months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs including approximately 30 million to expand our building footprint in thailand 

 

we expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 1827 million for fiscal 2008 and 3853   million for fiscal 2007 net cash used in financing activities was 1958 million for fiscal 2006 proceeds from the sale of stock the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were 591 million for fiscal 2008 687 million for fiscal 2007 and 958 million for fiscal 2006 during the twelve months ended march 31 2008 we received net proceeds of 11270 million from the issuance of our 2125 junior subordinated convertible debentures cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 11380 million in fiscal 2008 and 33 million in fiscal 2006 no amounts were expended in fiscal 2007 for the repurchase of common stock during fiscal 2007 we paid down 2690 million in shortterm borrowings during fiscal 2006 we paid down 455 million in shortterm borrowings and initiated new borrowings of 2690 million to complete the repatriation of 500 million in fiscal 2006 we initiated the 2690 million in borrowings which were collateralized against investments that were held in foreign locations allowing the investments to reach their normal maturity date effective with the adoption of sfas no 123r on april 1 2006 we began reporting the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements as a cash flow from financing activities rather than a cash flow from operating activities the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements was 212 million in fiscal 2008 and 228 million in fiscal 2007 

 

on october 23 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2008 no shares related to this authorization remained available for purchase under this program on december 11 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2008 6492234 shares related to this authorization remained available for purchase under this authorization 

 

 

 

our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 21500000 shares of our common stock concurrent with the junior subordinated convertible debenture transaction described in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and no further shares are available to be repurchased under this authorization 

 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 40 million we have continued to pay quarterly dividends and have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular basis during fiscal 2006 we paid dividends in the amount of 057 per share for a total dividend payment of 1201 million during fiscal 2007 we paid dividends in the amount of 0965 per share for a total dividend payment of 2079 million during fiscal 2008 we paid dividends in the amount of 1205 per share for a total dividend payment of 2520 million on april 28 2008 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 033 per share which will be paid on may 27 2008 to stockholders of record on may 12 2008 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be 609 million our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

 

we enter into derivative transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future at march 31 2008 we had foreign currency forward contracts of 24 million outstanding 

 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix and competitive factors there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2008 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on microchip and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of march 31 2008 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities and money market funds that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 10017 million as of march 31 2008 and 12784 million as of march 31 2007 these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 

 

 

we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been material to our operating results approximately 99 of our sales are denominated in us dollars we maintain hedges related to our foreign currency exposure of our net investment in a foreign operation as needed as of march 31 2008 there were 24 million of foreign currency hedges outstanding there were no hedges outstanding as of march 31 2007 and the amount of the hedges outstanding as of march 31 2006 was immaterial if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates at march 31 2008 and 2007 the effect on our financial position and results of operation would be immaterial 

 

our investment in marketable equity securities at march 31 2008 consists of shares of common stock the value of which is determined by the closing price of such shares on the respective markets on which the shares are traded as of the 

 

  

  

 

balance sheet date these investments are classified as trading securities and accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the market value of these investments was approximately 124 million at march 31 2008 compared to our adjusted cost basis of approximately 122 million the value of our investment in marketable equity securities would be materially impacted if there were a significant change in the market price of the shares a hypothetical 30 favorable or unfavorable change in the stock price compared to the stock price at march 31 2008 would have affected the value of our investment in marketable equity securities by less than 4 million additionally we have sold put options on one of the trading securities which are recorded as an accrued liability and are marked to market value a decline in the stock price of the underlying security prior to the expiration date of the puts would cause an increase to the liability which would result in a charge to our results of operations and could result in the put being exercised by the holder if the put is exercised by the holder we could be required to pay up to 173 million for additional shares of the common stock at a price potentially in excess of the then fair market value of the common stock a hypothetical 30 unfavorable change in the stock price of the trading security on which we have sold the puts compared to the stock price at march 31 2008 could potentially result in the puts being exercised and would result in our paying 173 million to acquire the shares of common stock the stock would then be marked to market value reducing the value of our investment by an additional 34 million see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 15a1 for additional information about our investments in marketable equity securities 

 

during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discuss in this item 7a and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders of 

microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries 

 

we have audited microchip technology incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria microchip technology incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion microchip technology incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2008 based on the coso criteria  

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the march 31 2008 consolidated financial statements of microchip technology incorporated and our report dated may 23 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

  industry background 

 

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and various analog and interface products 

 

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures 4bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive but they generally lack the minimum functionality required in most applications and are typically used in relatively simple applications 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of high volume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications 

 

many of the microcontrollers shipped today are rombased and must be programmed by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing resulting in long lead times based on market conditions for delivery of such microcontrollers in addition to delayed product introduction these long lead times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required to address these issues some suppliers offer programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the customer’s manufacturing line thus significantly reducing lead time and inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur while these microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to rombased microcontrollers manufacturing technology has evolved over time to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over rombased microcontrollers thus providing significant value to microcontroller customers as a result reprogrammable microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller market 

our products 

 

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

microcontrollers 

 

we offer a broad family of microcontroller products featuring our unique proprietary architecture marketed under the pic ® brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 5 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our pic products are designed for applications requiring fieldprogrammability high performance low power and cost effectiveness they feature a variety of memory technology configurations low voltage and power small footprint and ease of use our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set computer referred to as risc and variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative singlebus complex instruction set computer architectures referred to as cisc with over 400 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit and 16bit microcontroller markets additionally our scalable product architecture allows us to successfully target both the entrylevel of the 32bit microcontroller market as well as the 4bit microcontroller marketplace significantly enlarging our addressable market 

 

digital signal controllers dsc are a subset of our 16bit microcontroller offering our dspic ®   digital signal controller families integrate the control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of digital signal processors dsps along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic digital signal controllers enlarge our addressable market 

 

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced low cost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

development tools 

 

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic digital signal controllers for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

 

our family of development tools operates in the standard windows ® environment on standard pc hardware these tools range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation hardware customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our systems share the same integrated development environment 

 

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are more than 150 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

 

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped more than 500000 development tools 

analog and interface products 

 

our analog and interface products now consist of several families with over 500 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management and interface products at the end of fiscal 2007 our mixedsignal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 12100 end customers 

 

we continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy as well as to new customers in addition to our “attach” strategy we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

memory products 

 

our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory referred to as serial eeproms we sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide serial eeprom products are used for nonvolatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods serial eeproms have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small devices 

 

manufacturing 

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical techniques statistical process control 

 

designed experiments and wafer level monitoring we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

 

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wafer fabrication 

 

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 to 50 microns during fiscal 2007 fab 2 operated at approximately 99 of its capacity compared to approximately 98 during fiscal 2006 operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing 

 

fab 3 is currently nonoperational and being heldforfutureuse see “item 6 – selected financial data – fiscal 2003 – fab 3 impairment charge” below at page 20 for a discussion of the status of fab 3 

 

we acquired fab 4 in august 2002 and began production on october 31 2003 fab 4 currently produces 8inch wafers using predominantly 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns a significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment acquired with fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 3 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand 

 

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

 

we outsource a small percentage of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities 

assembly and test 

 

we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand at march 31 2007 approximately 72 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2007 our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

 

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and our effective use of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in 

 

the materials used and the performance of our manufacturing personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

 

at the end of fiscal 2007 we owned longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment intangibles and goodwill in the united states amounting to 5250 million and 1211 million in other countries including 1146 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2006 we owned longlived assets in the united states amounting to 5769 million and 1245 million in other countries including 1180 million in thailand 

research and development rd 

 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers serial eeprom memory analog and interface products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to enable new products and innovative features as well as achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

 

in fiscal 2007 our rd expenses were 1137   million compared to 949   million in fiscal 2006 and 930 million in fiscal 2005 rd expenses in fiscal 2007 included 96 million of sharebased compensation as a result of the adoption of fasb statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123r revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” 

sales and distribution 

general 

 

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

 

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

distribution 

 

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors can provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

 

in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we derived 65 of our net sales from sales through distributors and 35 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip our largest distributor accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 2005 our second largest distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2007   11 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 2006 or 2005 

 

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on our revenue 

 

we also grant certain credits to our distributors the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

 

we also provide these distributors with price protection by reducing product pricing based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against their outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory they have on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protection activity 

 

we do not offer material incentive programs to our distributors 

 

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

sales by geography 

sales by geography for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 73 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 2005 in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2007 2006 or 2005 

 

our international sales are predominately us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties to date as a result of export restrictions 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad strength in our overall business in recent periods has had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

backlog 

 

as of april 30 2007 our backlog was approximately 1854 million compared to 2312 million as of april 30 2006 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

 

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

 

competition 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue 

 

engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products furthermore capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position 

 

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

patents licenses and trademarks 

 

we maintain a portfolio of united states and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2007 and 2024 we also have numerous additional united states and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

 

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

environmental regulation 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 

 

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of or to adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

 

employees 

 

as of march 31 2007 we had 4582 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

 

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability  

 

our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

 

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines 

 

our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins 

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

 

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have proven our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results may suffer 

 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

 

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

 

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 

 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog products 

 

we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

 

sales through distributors accounted for 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and both we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

 

during fiscal 2006 we reduced the gross margin that certain of our distributors earn when they sell our products we reduced these distributors’ gross margins because we believed these distributors did not have sufficient technical sales resources to properly address the marketplace for our products since fiscal 2006 we have added a significant number of technical sales employees throughout our worldwide sales organization to address the support requirements for both our oem and distribution customers although these actions have not had a material adverse impact on the overall effectiveness of our distribution channel there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse impact in the future 

 

the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given period and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

 

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 

 

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel is intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team as a result of the anticipated impact that the adoption of sfas no 123r in our first quarter of 2007 would have on our results of operations we changed our equity compensation program during fiscal 2006 we now grant fewer equity based shares per employee and the type of equity instrument is generally restricted stock units rather than stock options this change in our equity compensation program may make it more difficult for us to attract or retain qualified management and engineering personnel which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us 

 

we use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption further procurement from third parties is done by purchase order and contracts if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in particular quarters of our fiscal year however broad strength in our overall business in recent periods and semiconductor industry conditions have had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a 

 

geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters we were involved in patent infringement litigation with philips corporation which was settled in fiscal 2005 as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our product line or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in value of inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

 

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses related to the defense of such claims diversion of resources increased costs associated with the replacement of affected products lost revenue or delay in recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders and unpaid receivables customer imposed fines or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements and a requirement to pay damages claims because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell these expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits we received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have product liability insurance but there is no certainty that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

 

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of their systems could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause the system failures based on our historical experience we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low however we will face increased exposure to product liability claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures caused by our devices 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

 

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us 

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers  

 

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we have over 56000 end customers and our ten largest customers make up approximately 10 of our total revenue cancellation of longterm and shortterm customer contracts could have an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits 

 

further as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale under these contracts we commit to supply quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates if we become unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or quality related issues under these contracts we may be liable for the costs the customer has incurred while we try to limit such liabilities if they should arise there may be a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

business interruptions could harm our business 

 

operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure fire earthquake floods or other natural disasters if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis if this occurs we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers in addition business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

 

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

 

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2007 and 2006 approximately 74 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand we also use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

interruptions in information technology systems could affect our business 

 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption including but not limited to computer viruses security breaches or energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results we have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions but such disruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial results in addition we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may affect our profitability and liquidity 

 

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some risks and obligations in these circumstances we have determined that it is more cost effective to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the increased premium costs in place since the disruption in the insurance market after the events of september 11 2001 the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to certain property product defects political risks and patent infringement should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition result of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

 

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our products and manufacturing process although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations our failure to 

 

comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or a cessation of operations any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities 

 

over the past few years there has been an expansion in environmental laws focusing on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products for example the eu rohs directive provided that beginning july 1 2006 electronic products sold into europe were required to meet stringent chemical restrictions including the absence of lead china is adopting similar requirements the first phase of the china legislation requires labeling and chemical content disclosure for all electronic products sold into or within china after february 28 2007 while at this time our semiconductor products do not directly fall under the china legislation we have complied with it in order to support our customers compliance efforts as the law is further implemented we may need to take additional compliance activities these laws impact our products and may make it more expensive to manufacture and sell our products it may be difficult to timely comply with these laws and we may not have sufficient quantities of compliant materials to meet customers’ needs thereby adversely impacting our sales and profitability 

regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship our products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 

 

a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the united states through exporting and reexporting of products in addition to local jurisdictions’ export regulations our us manufactured products or products based on us technology are subject to export administration regulations “ear” when exported and reexported to and from all international jurisdictions licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain countries noncompliance with the ear or other export regulations can result in penalties including denial of export privileges fines criminal penalties and seizure of products such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business including our ability to meet our net sales and earnings targets 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our common stock 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 

in the event we make acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits 

 

while acquisitions do not represent a major part of our growth strategy from time to time we may consider financially attractive and strategic acquisitions if such opportunities arise any transactions that we complete may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired business or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process in addition we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies

   2 located in the alphatechnopolis industrial park near bangkok on land to which we expect to acquire title in accordance with our agreement with the   landowner progress towards obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due to a bankruptcy relating to the seller of the land we are currently working with the creditors in an attempt to reach resolution on this matter at this time it is not possible to estimate when or if full title transfer will be completed we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land 

 

in addition to the facilities we own we lease several research and development facilities and sales offices in north america europe and asia our aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately 04 million 

  we currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our production requirements for the next 12 months

introduction 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 1 – business” “item 6 – selected financial data” and “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data” 

 

we begin our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of microchip’s overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 27 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements” 

strategy 

 

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices interface devices serial eeproms and our patented k ee l oq   security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

 

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit margin 

 

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

 

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

 

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars for our customers in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

 

our discussion and analysis of microchip’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition sharebased compensation inventories income taxes property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

revenue recognition – distributors 

 

our distributors worldwide have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue impact to us from the price protections we also grant certain credits to our distributors the credits are granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide documentation of the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers upon our shipment to distributors amounts billed are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved and the sale and the gross margin are deferred and are reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their customers 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we adopted sfas no 123r which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including grants of employee stock options rsus and employee stock purchase rights to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values total sharebased compensation in fiscal 2007 was 307 million of which 241 million was reflected in operating expenses 33 million was reflected in cost of goods sold and 33 million was capitalized to inventory 

 

  determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant requires judgment the fair value of our rsus is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholes model also require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future the riskfree interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after april 1 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate 

then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements if forfeiture adjustments are made they would affect our gross margin research and development expenses and selling general administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2007 was immaterial 

 

we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis if factors change and we employ different assumptions sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unearned sharebased compensation expense future sharebased compensation expense and unearned sharebased compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions had we adopted sfas no 123r in prior periods the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of sfas no 123 assuming the application of the blackscholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our inventory obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and record impairment charges for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

income taxes 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2007 our gross deferred tax asset was 620 million 

 

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the united states internal revenue service “irs” for our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

property plant  equipment 

 

property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred at march 31 2007 the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled 6057 million which represents 267 of our total assets this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30 years on buildings 

 

we began production activities at fab 4 on october 31 2003 we began to depreciate the fab 4 assets as they were placed in service for production purposes as of march 31 2007 all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service all manufacturing equipment that was not being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management believes there will be no change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into productive service the lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets 

 

on march 31 2005 we changed the classification of fab 3 from an asset heldforsale to an asset heldforfutureuse fab 3 had been on the market for over two years and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility over that period of time our business had increased significantly and over the next several years we will need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of fab 4’s clean room capacity is utilized we determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing the fab 3 facility and hold it for our future use as a result of this change in classification we had to assess the fair value of the fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification from “heldforsale” to “heldforfutureuse” under sfas no 144 we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the asset the discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of the fab 3 asset at march 31 2005 was not in excess of its fair value if indicators of impairment for the fab 3 assets arise in the future we will determine if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value if less we would recognize an impairment loss on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values we began to depreciate the fab 3 asset in april 2005 

 

the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations could result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

 

we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility resides the land is subject to a bankruptcy relating to the seller of the land we are currently working with the creditors in attempts to reach resolution on this matter we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land however timing of the resolution is difficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change 

impairment of property plant and equipment 

 

we assess whether indicators of impairment of longlived assets are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value if less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset we may incur impairment losses or additional losses on already impaired assets in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 

litigation 

 

our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss recorded reserves were immaterial at march 31 2007 

 

because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on our pending litigation we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 

 

net sales 

 

we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 

 

our net sales of 10397 million in fiscal 2007 increased by 1118 million or 108 over fiscal 2006 and net sales of 9279 million in fiscal 2006 increased by 810 million or 96 over fiscal 2005 the increases in net sales in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from increased demand predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller and analog products average selling prices for our products were flat in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 and down approximately 4 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 the number of units of our products sold was up approximately 12 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 and approximately 14 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years key factors in achieving the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems under our shipping terms legal title generally passes to the customer upon shipment from microchip we have no post shipment obligations distributors worldwide generally have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributors sell the product to their customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors are included in accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributors to their customers 

 

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

microcontrollers 

 

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 802 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 approximately 793 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 797 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 

 

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 133 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and increased approximately 91 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the increases in net sales were primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets driven principally by market share gains and those factors described above under “net sales” at page 27 the end markets that we serve include the consumer automotive industrial control communications and computing control markets 

 

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

memory products 

 

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 118 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 approximately 135 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 136 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 

 

net sales of our memory products decreased approximately 21 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and increased approximately 89 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales 

 

serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

analog and interface products 

 

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 80 of our total net sales in fiscal 2007 72 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 67 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 

 

net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 245 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and increased approximately 166 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in net sales of our analog and interface products in these periods were driven primarily by market share gains and supply and demand conditions within the analog and interface market 

 

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than half of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products will increase over time 

distribution 

 

distributors accounted for 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 our two largest distributors together accounted for 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 24 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 25 of our net sales in 2005 

 

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

 

at march 31 2007 distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 18 months of inventory of our products calculated based on the prior three months of their sell through activity over the past three fiscal years the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 18 months and 25 months thus inventory levels at our distributors are at the low end of the range we have experienced over the last three years we do not believe that 

 

inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors 

 

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on our revenue recognition 

 

we also grant certain credits to our distributors and also offer these distributors price protection the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protection 

 

we do not offer material incentive programs to our distributors 

sales by geography 

 

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

  our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

 

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 73 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 18 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 and approximately 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and 2005 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

gross profit 

 

our gross profit was 6248 million in fiscal 2007 5509 million in fiscal 2006 and 4840 million in fiscal 2005 gross profit as a percent of sales was 601 in fiscal 2007 594 in fiscal 2006 and 571 in fiscal 2005 

 

the most significant factors affecting our gross profit percentage over the past three fiscal years were 

 

 

 

 

other factors that impacted our gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

 

 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2007 we operated at approximately 99 of our fab 2 capacity during fiscal 2006 we operated at approximately 98 of our fab 2 capacity our utilization of fab 4’s total capacity is at relatively low levels although we are utilizing all of the installed equipment base we expect to maintain the current level of capacity utilization at fab 2 during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and to modestly increase the current level of capacity utilization at fab 4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

the process technologies utilized impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes at march 31 2007 fab 4 predominantly utilized our 05 micron process technology we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs all of our production has been on 8inch wafers during the periods covered by this report 

 

our overall inventory levels were 1210 million at march 31 2007 compared to 1150 million at march 31 2006 and 1037 million at march 31 2005 we maintained 107 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2007 compared to 106 days of inventory at march 31 2006 and 107 days at march 31 2005 

 

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption capacity utilization levels particularly those at fab 4 and competitive and economic conditions 

 

at march 31 2007 approximately 72 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 66 as of march 31 2006 and approximately 70 at march 31 2005 contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility over the last three fiscal years we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

 

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication requirements 

 

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our third party contractors our future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

research and development rd 

 

rd expenses for fiscal 2007 were 1137 million or 109 of sales compared to 949 million or 102 of sales for fiscal 2006 and 930 million or 110 of sales for fiscal 2005 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position we expense all rd costs as incurred rd expenses include labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

 

rd expenses increased 188 million or 198 for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal rd headcount increases in bonuses and 96 million of sharebased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r rd expenses increased 19 million or 20 for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 were higher labor and recruitment costs as a result of expanding our technical resources and increases in bonuses 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 were 1632   million or 157 of sales compared to 1296 million or 140 of sales for fiscal 2006 and 1112 million or 131 of sales for fiscal 2005 selling general and 

 

administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 337   million or 260 for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the primary reasons for the dollar increases in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources involved in the technical aspects of selling our products increases in bonuses and 145 million of sharebased compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r selling general and administrative expenses increased 184 million or 165 for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources increases in bonuses and increases in travel expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

special charges 

 

in fiscal 2005 we reached an agreement with us philips corporation and philips electronics north america corp together “philips” regarding patent license litigation between philips and ourselves the agreement included dismissal of the then pending litigation and the crosslicense of certain patents between philips and microchip we recorded a special charge of 211 million in the quarter ended june 30 2004 associated with this matter as part of the settlement we licensed certain of our patents related to 8pin microcontrollers to philips and philips licensed its patents related to i 2 c serial communications to us each on fullypaid up nonroyalty bearing worldwide licenses the definitive agreement related to this matter was finalized and executed and we made a cash payment to philips during our fiscal quarter ending september 30 2004 

 

there were no special charges in fiscal 2007 or 2006 

other income expense 

 

interest income in fiscal 2007 increased from interest income in fiscal 2006 as our average invested balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and we earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances interest income in fiscal 2006 increased from interest income in fiscal 2005 as our average invested balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and we earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances 

provision for income taxes 

 

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate was 110 in fiscal 2007 325 in fiscal 2006 and 229 in fiscal 2005 and is lower than statutory rates in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations rd tax credits and export sales incentives our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 reflects a 522 million benefit related to a tax settlement for our fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2001 tax years that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which decreased our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 by 130 our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 reflects a 306 million tax expense related to the repatriation of 500 million of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act the “jobs act” that was effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 by 85 we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 to be approximately 20 

 

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other pending audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

 

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future one of our thailand tax holidays expired in september 2006 and the 

 

expiration did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our overall effective tax rate any expiration of tax holidays are expected to have a minimal impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and increases in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we had 12784 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2007 a decrease of 67 million from the march 31 2006 balance the decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to a 2690 million pay down of shortterm debt offset by cash generated from operating activities 

 

net cash provided from operating activities was 4298 million for fiscal 2007 4373 million for fiscal 2006 and 3527 million for fiscal 2005 the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to increases in net income and changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities accrued income taxes reduced by 604 million and accounts payable reduced by 162 million in fiscal 2007 

 

net cash used in investing activities was 4422 million for fiscal 2007 1366 million for fiscal 2006 and 3707 million in fiscal 2005 the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of investments the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of investments 

 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 600 million in fiscal 2007 763 million in fiscal 2006 and 632 million in fiscal 2005 the primary reason for the dollar differences in capital expenditures in the periods covered by this report related to requirements for funding capital expansion activities in our manufacturing operations we currently intend to spend approximately 80 million during the next 12 months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

 

we expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 3853 million for fiscal 2007 net cash provided by financing activities was 1958   million for fiscal 2006 net cash used in financing activities was 186 million for fiscal 2005 proceeds from the sale of stock the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were 687 million for fiscal 2007 958 million for fiscal 2006 and 472 million for fiscal 2005 cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 0 in fiscal 2007 33 million in fiscal 2006 and 683 million in fiscal 2005 we had shortterm borrowings of 0 at march 31 2007 2690 million at march 31 2006 and 455 million at march 31 2005 the shortterm borrowings of 2690 million at march 31 2006 relate to transactions associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the jobs act during fiscal 2007 we paid down 2690 million in shortterm borrowings during fiscal 2006 we paid down 455 million in shortterm borrowings and initiated new borrowings of 2690 million to complete the repatriation of 500 million in fiscal 2006 we initiated the 2690 million in borrowings which were collateralized against investments that were held in the foreign locations allowing the investments to reach their normal maturity date the shortterm debt was a result of repurchase agreements that were in place with two investment firms effective with the adoption of sfas no 123r on april 1 2006 we began reporting the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements as a cash flow from financing activities rather than a cash flow from operating activities the excess tax benefit from sharebased payment arrangements was 228 million in fiscal 2007 

 

on april 22 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2007 we had repurchased 1004834 common shares under this authorization for a total of 266 million on october 25 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2007 no shares had been purchased under this authorization as of march 31 2007 all of the purchased shares under our authorized repurchase programs had been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations 

 

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 40 million we have continued to pay quarterly dividends and have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular basis during fiscal 2005 we paid dividends in the amount of 0208 per share for a total dividend payment of 430 million during fiscal 2006 we paid dividends in the amount of 057 per share for a total dividend payment of 1201 million during fiscal 2007 we paid dividends in the amount of 0965 per share for a total dividend payment of 2079 million on 

 

april 26 2007 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 028 per share which will be paid on may 24 2007 to stockholders of record on may 10 2007 and the total amount of such dividend is expected to be 609 million our board is free to change its dividend practices at any time and to decrease or increase the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

 

we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to reduce our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future we had no hedging transactions outstanding at march 31 2007 

 

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix and competitive factors there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2007 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on microchip and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of march 31 2007 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 3a4ii of sec regulation sk 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are reviewing our tax positions taken to determine the effect if any that the adoption of this interpretation will have on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurement sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurement sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are in the process of determining the effect if any that the adoption of sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements because statement no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements or remeasurements of previously computed fair values we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

  on february 15 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 159 under this standard we may elect to report financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contractbycontract basis with changes in value reported in earnings this election is irrevocable sfas no 159 provides an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings that is caused by measuring hedged assets and liabilities that were previously required to use a different accounting method than the related hedging contracts when the complex provisions of sfas no 133 hedge accounting are not met sfas no 159 is effective for years beginning after november 15 2007 early adoption within 120 days of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year is permissible provided we have not yet issued interim financial statement for 2008 and have adopted sfas no 157 we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities and money market funds that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 12784 million as of march 31 2007 and 12851 million as of march 31 2006 these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 

 

 

we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant approximately 99 of our sales are denominated in us dollars we maintain hedges related to our foreign currency exposure of our net investment in a foreign operation as needed there were no hedges outstanding as of march 31 2007 or march 31 2005 the amount of the hedges outstanding as of march 31 2006 was immaterial if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates at march 31 2007 and 2006 the effect on our financial position and results of operation would be immaterial 

 

during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discuss in this item 7a and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and stockholders of 

microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting that microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria microchip technology incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that microchip technology incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2007 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion microchip technology incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2007 based on the coso criteria  

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the march 31 2007 consolidated financial statements of microchip technology incorporated and our report dated may 23 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

•   differentiate their products

•   replace less efficient electromechanical control devices

•   reduce the number of components in their system

•   add product functionality

•   decrease time to market for their products 

•   significantly reduce product cost

  

  

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

  

   

embedded control systems also facilitate the emergence of new classes of products embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and various analog and interface products 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the larger segments of the semiconductor market microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures 4bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive but they generally lack the minimum functionality required in most applications and are typically used in relatively simple applications 8bit microcontrollers remain very costeffective for a wide range of high volume embedded control applications and as a result continue to represent the largest portion of the overall microcontroller market 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide higher performance and functionality and are generally found in more complex embedded control applications 

  

most microcontrollers shipped today are rombased and must be programmed by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing resulting in 812week lead times based on market conditions for delivery of such microcontrollers in addition to delayed product introduction these long lead times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required to address these issues some suppliers offer programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the customer’s manufacturing line thus significantly reducing lead time and inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur while these microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to rombased microcontrollers manufacturing technology has evolved over time to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over rombased microcontrollers thus providing significant value to microcontroller customers as a result reprogrammable microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller market 

  

our products 

  

our strategic focus is on embedded control solutions including 

  

•   microcontrollers

•   development tools

•   applicationspecific standard products

•   analog and interface products

•   memory products

  

we provide highly costeffective embedded control solutions that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

  

  

microcontrollers 

  

we offer a broad family of microcontroller products featuring a unique proprietary architecture marketed under the pic ® brand name we believe that our pic product family is a priceperformance leader in the worldwide microcontroller market we have shipped over 4 billion pic microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our pic products are designed for applications requiring fieldprogrammability high performance low power and cost effectiveness they feature a variety of memory technology configurations low voltage and power small footprint and ease of use our performance results from a product architecture which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set computer referred to as risc and variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages over alternative singlebus complex instruction set computer architectures referred to as cisc with almost 350 microcontrollers in our product portfolio we target the 8bit and 16bit microcontroller markets additionally our scalable product architecture allows us to successfully target both the entrylevel of the 32bit microcontroller market as well as the 4bit microcontroller marketplace significantly enlarging our addressable market 

  

digital signal controllers dsc are a subset of our 16bit microcontroller offering our dspic ® digital signal controller families integrate the control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the computation capabilities of digital signal processors dsps along with a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic digital signal controllers enlarge our addressable market 

  

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced low cost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

  

development tools 

  

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic digital signal controllers for specific applications and we believe are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

  

our family of development tools operates in the standard windows ® environment on standard pc hardware these tools range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation hardware customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our systems share the same integrated development environment 

  

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are more than 150 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

  

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of both our and thirdparty development tools by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped more than 430000 development tools 

  

assps   

our applicationspecific standard products referred to as assps are specialized products designed to perform specific enduser applications compared to our other products that are more general purpose in nature our assp device families currently include among others our keeloq family of secure data transmission products 

  

  

analog and interface products 

  

our analog and interface products now consist of several families with over 450 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management and interface products at the end of fiscal 2006 our mixedsignal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 10000 end customers 

  

we continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy as well as to new customers in addition to our “attach” strategy we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to provide customers with application solutions 

  

memory products 

  

our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory referred to as serial eeproms we sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide serial eeprom products are used for nonvolatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods serial eeproms have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small devices 

  

we address customer requirements by offering products with extremely small package sizes and very low operating voltages for both read and write functions our memory products also feature long data retention and high erasewrite endurance 

  

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing proprietary statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

  

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

•   tempe arizona fab 2

•   chandler arizona probe operations 

•   puyallup washington fab 3 nonoperational

•   gresham oregon fab 4 

•   bangkok thailand assembly probe and test

  

wafer fabrication   

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes from 035 to 50 microns during fiscal 2006 fab 2 operated at approximately 98 of its capacity compared to approximately 96 during fiscal 2005 operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing 

  

fab 3 is currently nonoperational and being heldforfutureuse see “ item 6  selected financial data  fiscal 2003  fab 3 impairment charge ” below at page 22 for a discussion of the status of fab 3 

  

we acquired fab 4 in august 2002 and began production on october 31 2003 at march 31 2006 fab 4 produced 8inch wafers using predominantly 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns a significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment acquired with fab 4 can be brought on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 3 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand 

  

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive 

  

we outsource a small percentage of our wafer production requirements to thirdparty wafer foundries to augment our internal manufacturing capabilities 

  

assembly and test   

we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand at march 31 2006 approximately 66 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2006 our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production we use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations   

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results our continuous focus on manufacturing productivity has allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and selective upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

  

at the end of fiscal 2006 we owned longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment and goodwill in the united states amounting to 5769 million and 1245 million in other countries including 1180 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2005 we owned longlived assets in the united states amounting to 6280 million and 1064 million in other countries including 1006 million in thailand 

  

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers assps serial eeprom memory analog and interface products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2006 our rd expenses were 949 million compared to 930 million in fiscal 2005 and 854 million in fiscal 2004 

  

  

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market the majority of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team faes also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world 

  

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors can provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we added significant resources to our internal sales force to provide technical sales support for our customers in both the oem and distribution channels we believe that some of our distribution partners have limited internal resources to support the technical sales activities associated with selling our products and we have added our own employees to support these activities 

  

in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we derived 65 of our net sales from sales through distributors and 35 of our net sales from customers serviced directly by microchip distributors accounted for 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 our second largest distributor accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 2005 or 2004 

  

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on our revenue 

  

we also grant certain credits to our distributors the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

  

we also provide these distributors with price protection by reducing product pricing based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against their outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory they have on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protection activity 

  

we do not offer material incentive programs to our distributors 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

sales to customers in asia have increased as a percentage of sales from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 and from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 we attribute this to the fact that many of our customers are transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia as well as to the growth in the demand of customers in asia 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 73 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and 71 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 approximately 16 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2006 2005 or 2004 

  

our international sales are predominately us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties as a result of export restrictions to date 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad strength in our overall business in recent periods has had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 30 2006 our backlog was approximately 2312 million compared to 1669 million as of april 29 2005 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

  

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products furthermore capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position 

  

  

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

   

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

   

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of united states and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2006 and 2024 we also have numerous additional united states and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

  

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that all licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to adequately control the storage use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of or to adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

  

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

  

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability  

  

our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

•   changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers

•   levels of inventories at our customers

•   the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory

  

  

•   changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields

•   our ability to secure sufficient assembly and testing capacity

•   availability of raw materials and equipment

•   competitive developments including pricing pressures

•   the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter

•   the level of sellthrough of our products through distribution

•   changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality

•   constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability to ship their products which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers

•   costs and outcomes of any tax audits or any litigation involving intellectual property customers or other issues

•   disruptions in our business or our customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity armed conflict war worldwide oil prices and supply public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system

•   property damage or other losses which are not covered by insurance

•   general economic industry or political conditions in the united states or internationally

  

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

  

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

  

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment and other quality issues as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels this could include delays in the recognition of revenue loss of revenue or future orders and customerimposed penalties for failure to meet contractual shipment deadlines 

  

our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins 

  

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

  

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have proven our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results may suffer 

  

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market for embedded control applications we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

  

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including but not limited to 

  

•   the quality performance reliability features ease of use pricing and diversity of our products

•   our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies

•   the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own applications

•   product introductions by our competitors

•   the number nature and success of our competitors in a given market

•   our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices

•   our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights

•   the quality of our customer service and our ability to address the needs of our customers and

•   general market and economic conditions

  

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products 

  

we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

  

our business is dependent on selling through distributors 

  

sales through distributors accounted for 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and both we and our distributors may each terminate our relationship with little or no advanced notice we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel 

  

during fiscal 2006 we reduced the gross margin that certain of our distributors earn when they sell our products we reduced these distributors’ gross margins because we believe these distributors did not have sufficient technical sales resources to properly address the marketplace for our products we have added a significant number of technical sales employees throughout our worldwide sales organization to address the support requirements for both our oem and distribution customers we cannot predict the impact if any that our actions will have on our relationships with such distributors 

  

the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given period and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

  

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including but not limited to 

  

•   proper new product selection

•   timely completion and introduction of new product designs

•   development of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and

•   market acceptance of our customers’ end products

  

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to 

  

  

design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

  

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

  

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 

  

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel is intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

  

we are dependent on several contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us 

  

we use several contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our contractors could harm our business and operating results 

  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any contractor were to experience financial operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption further procurement from third parties is done by purchase order and contracts if these third parties are unable or unwilling to timely deliver products or services conforming to our quality standards we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us in such event we could experience an interruption in production an increase in manufacturing and production costs decline in product reliability and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

  

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

  

our operating results may be impacted by both seasonality and the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand since a significant portion of our revenue is from consumer markets and international sales our business may be subject to seasonally lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year however broad strength in our overall business in recent periods has had a more significant impact on our results than seasonality and has made it difficult to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business the industry has also experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations 

  

  

in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

  

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

  

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters we were involved in patent infringement litigation with philips corporation which was settled in fiscal 2005 as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms reengineer our products or processes to avoid infringement andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any of them be required to take an appropriate charge to operations be enjoined from selling a material portion of our product line or using certain processes suffer a reduction or elimination in value of inventories and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses related to the defense of such claims increased costs associated with the replacement of affected products and a requirement to pay damages claims because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell these expenses and damages may be significantly higher than the sales and profits the company received from the products involved while we specifically exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by applicable law we do have product liability insurance but there is no certainty that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

  

further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive aerospace and medical where failure of their systems could cause damage to property or persons we may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause the system failures based on our historical experience we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low however we will face increased exposure to product liability claims if there are substantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications and the frequency of system failures caused by our devices 

  

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

  

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may ourselves initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us 

  

we do not typically have longterm contracts with our customers  

  

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer even though we have over 50000 end customers and our ten largest customers make up approximately 10 of our total revenue cancellation of longterm and shortterm customer contracts could have an adverse financial impact on our revenue and profits 

  

further as the practice has become more commonplace in the industry we have entered into contracts with certain customers that differ from our standard terms of sale under these contracts we commit to supply quantities of products on scheduled delivery dates if we become unable to supply the customer as required under the contract the customer may incur additional production costs lost revenues due to subsequent delays in their own manufacturing schedule or quality related issues under these contracts we may be liable for the costs the customer has incurred while we try to limit such liabilities if they should arise there may be a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

  

  

business interruptions could harm our business 

  

operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure fire earthquake floods or other natural disasters if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis if this occurs we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers in addition business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

  

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

  

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2006 approximately 74 of our net sales were made to foreign customers during fiscal 2005 approximately 73 of our net sales were made to foreign customers during fiscal 2004 approximately 71 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand we also use various foreign contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

  

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including but not limited to 

  

•   political social and economic instability

•   public health conditions

•   trade restrictions and changes in tariffs

•   import and export license requirements and restrictions

•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations

•   employment regulations

•   disruptions in international transport or delivery

•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates

•   difficulties in collecting receivables

•   economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us and

•   potentially adverse tax consequences

  

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

  

interruptions in information technology systems could affect our business 

  

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption including but not limited to computer viruses security breach and energy blackouts could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results we have implemented measures to manage our risks related to such disruptions but such disruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial results in addition we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

  

the occurrence of events for which we are selfinsured or which exceed our insurance limits may affect our profitability and liquidity 

  

we have insurance contracts with independent insurance companies related to many different types of risk however we selfinsure for some risks and obligations in these circumstances we have determined that it is more cost effective to selfinsure certain risks than to pay the increased premium costs in place since the disruption in the insurance market after the events of september 11 2001 the risks and exposures that we selfinsure include but are not limited to product defects 

  

  

political risks and patent infringement should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are selfinsured then our financial condition result of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

  

we must comply with many different federal state local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or a cessation of operations any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities 

  

further certain of our customers shipping their products into european markets are also subject to governmental environmental regulations such as the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs which will be effective july 1 2006 these directives focus on limiting the amounts of certain elements such as lead in electrical devices the inability of this subset of our customers to use microchip products which contain lead after july 2006 may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

compliance with future changes to securities laws and related regulations could result in increased costs to us 

  

changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules enacted and proposed by the securities and exchange commission sec the nasdaq stock market ® nasdaq and the new york stock exchange nyse resulted in significantly increased costs to us in fiscal 2005 as we responded to their requirements in particular complying with the internal control audit requirements of sarbanesoxley section 404 in fiscal 2005 resulted in increased internal efforts and significantly higher fees from our independent accounting firm in fiscal 2006 our costs associated with these activities were at approximately the same levels as in fiscal 2005 further changes in applicable legal or accounting requirements could result in additional costs in future periods 

  

this report on form 10k contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2006 this form 10k also contains an attestation and report by our auditors with respect to our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section 404 while these assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting compliance with section 404 is an ongoing process and will be required for each future fiscal year we expect that the ongoing compliance with section 404 will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses with not be identified in future periods any adverse results from such ongoing compliance efforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

  

recent regulations related to equity compensation will adversely affect our earnings and our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

  

since our inception we have used stock options and other longterm equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages and have accounted for them using the intrinsic value method of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” we believe that stock options and other longterm equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use of vesting encourage employees to remain with microchip in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payments” “sfas 123r” which changed us generally accepted accounting principles in such a way to require us to record a charge to earnings for the fair value of employee stock option grants and other share based compensation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 this regulation will negatively impact our earnings for those share based awards that vest beginning in fiscal 2007 furthermore adoption of sfas 123r will require us to make certain assumptions and judgments in the valuation of stock options that we may grant in the future a change in any of those assumptions or judgments could change the compensation expense that is charged against our earnings and consequently adversely affect our results of operations see also note 1 to the consolidated financial statements – significant accounting policies sharebased payment 

  

  

in addition recent regulations implemented by nasdaq requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans as well as recent regulations implemented by nyse prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equitycompensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant equitybased awards to employees in the future to the extent that these or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees we may incur compensation costs productivity losses change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including but not limited to 

  

•   quarterly variations in our operating results and the operating results of other technology companies

•   actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors

•   changes in analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or buysell recommendations

•   changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance

•   general conditions in the semiconductor industry and

•   worldwide economic and financial conditions

  

in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our common stock 

  

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have an adverse effect on future operating results 

  

in the event we make acquisitions we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits 

  

while acquisitions do not represent a major part of our growth strategy from time to time we may consider financially attractive and strategic acquisitions if such opportunities arise any transactions that we complete may involve a number of risks including the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process in addition we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies

none 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

at march 31 2006 we owned the facilities described below 

  

  

   

1   on june 30 2003 we completed closure of fab 1 on our chandler campus and integrated certain of the personnel and processes into fab 2

2   currently nonoperational and being heldforfutureuse fab 3 consists of manufacturing buildings and land with no equipment

3   located in the alphatechnopolis industrial park near bangkok on land to which we expect to acquire title in accordance with our agreement with the landowner progress towards obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due to a bankruptcy relating to the seller of the land at this time it is not possible to estimate when or if full title transfer will be completed we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land

  

in addition to the facilities we own we lease several research and development facilities and sales offices in north america europe and asia our aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately 04 million 

  

we currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our production requirements for the next 12 months 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them although the outcome of these actions is not presently determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future

introduction 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 1 – business” “item 6 – selected financial data” and “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

we begin our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of microchip’s overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 27 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements”   

strategy   

our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices and complementary microperipheral products including interface devices serial eeproms and our patented keeloq security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit margin 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers assps memory and mixedsignal products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that our direct sales personnel combined with our distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad 

  

  

and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general   

our discussion and analysis of microchip’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment and assets held for sale and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

  

revenue recognition — distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue impact from the price protections we also grant certain credits to our distributors the credits are granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide documentation of the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved and the sale and the gross margin are deferred and are reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their customers 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our reserves for obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

  

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2006 our gross deferred tax asset was 785 million 

  

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the united states internal revenue service “irs” for our fiscal years ended march 31 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 as part of this ongoing audit the irs has proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these returns the irs has issued formal assessments for these adjustments we do not agree with these adjustments and are appealing these assessments we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the appeals process with the irs the irs is currently auditing our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

property plant  equipment 

  

property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred at march 31 2006 the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled 6600 million which represents 281 of our total assets this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30 years on buildings 

  

we began production activities at fab 4 on october 31 2003 we began to depreciate the fab 4 assets as they were placed in service for production purposes as of march 31 2006 all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service all manufacturing equipment that was not being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management believes there will be no change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into productive service the lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets 

  

on march 31 2005 we changed the classification of fab 3 from an asset heldforsale to an asset heldforfutureuse fab 3 had been on the market for over two years and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility over that period of time our business had increased significantly and over the next several years we will need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of fab 4’s clean room capacity is utilized we determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing the fab 3 facility and hold it for our future use as a result of this change in classification we had to assess the fair value of the fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification from “heldforsale” to “heldforfutureuse” under sfas no 144 we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the asset the discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of the fab 3 asset at march 31 2005 was not in excess of its fair value if indicators of impairment for the fab 3 assets arise in the future we will determine if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value if less we would recognize an impairment loss on the 

  

  

excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values we began to depreciate the fab 3 asset in april 2005 

  

the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations could result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

  

we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility resides the land is subject to a bankruptcy relating to the seller of the land we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land however timing of the resolution is difficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change 

  

impairment of property plant and equipment 

  

we assess whether indicators of impairment of longlived assets are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value if less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset we may incur impairment losses or additional losses on already impaired assets in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 

  

litigation 

  

our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss recorded reserves were not significant at march 31 2006 

  

because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 

  

   

net sales   

we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers referred to as oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 

  

our net sales of 9279 million in fiscal 2006 increased by 810 million or 96 over fiscal 2005 and net sales of 8469 million in fiscal 2005 increased by 1476 million or 211 over fiscal 2004 the increases in net sales in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from increased demand 

  

  

predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller and analog products average selling prices for our products were down approximately 4 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 and approximately 4 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 the number of units of our products sold was up approximately 14 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 and approximately 26 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold and overall semiconductor market conditions we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years key factors in achieving the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

  

•   continued market share gains

•   increasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products

•   customers’ increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions

•   our new product offerings that have increased our served available market 

•   increasing demand for our products

  

we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems under our shipping terms legal title passes to the customer upon shipment from microchip we have no post shipment obligations distributors worldwide generally have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributors sell the product to their customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors are included in accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributors to their customers 

  

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2006 2005 and 2004 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 793 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 approximately 797 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 and approximately 796 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 91 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and increased approximately 212 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 the increases in net sales were primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets driven principally by market share gains and those factors described above under “ net sales ” at page 27 the end markets that we serve include the automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control markets 

  

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 135 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 approximately 136 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 and approximately 131 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 

  

  

net sales of our memory products increased approximately 89 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and increased approximately 256 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales 

  

serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog and interface products 

  

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 72 of our total net sales in fiscal 2006 67 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 and approximately 73 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 

  

net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 166 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and increased approximately 119 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 the increase in net sales of our analog and interface products in these periods were driven primarily by new proprietary design wins supply and demand conditions within the market and our ability to gain market share 

  

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than half of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products will increase over time 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 

  

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 our two largest distributors together accounted for 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns   

  

at march 31 2006 distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 20 months of inventory of our products over the past three fiscal years the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 20 months and 25 months thus inventory levels at our distributors are at the low end of the range we have experienced over the last three years we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales due to the fact that we recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors 

  

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on revenue recognition 

  

we also grant certain credits to our distributors and also offer these distributors price protection the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

  

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is 

  

  

offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protection 

  

we do not offer material incentive programs to our distributors 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2006 2005 and 2004 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america sales to customers in asia have increased during the last three fiscal years due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia and growth in demand from the emerging asian market 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 74 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 73 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and 71 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 17 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit   

our gross profit was 5509 million in fiscal 2006 4840 million in fiscal 2005 and 3500 million in fiscal 2004 gross profit as a percent of sales was 594 in fiscal 2006 571 in fiscal 2005 and 500 in fiscal 2004   

the most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage over the past three fiscal years were 

  

•   improvements in capacity utilization and product absorption which positively affected gross margin by 230 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and by 118 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004

•   318 million in accelerated depreciation and other costs associated with the closure of fab 1 which negatively affected gross margin in fiscal 2004

•   changes in period cost of sales in fab 3 and fab 4 our nonoperational facilities at certain times during the last three fiscal years which impact gross margin period cost of sales amounted to 56 million in fiscal 2006 33 million in fiscal 2005 and 181 million in fiscal 2004

•   a oneweek unpaid shutdown negatively affecting gross profit by 17 million in fiscal 2004 the shutdown occurred in the three months ended september 30 2003 and had a negative impact on gross profit due to the fact that certain fixed costs including depreciation utilities property taxes and other ongoing costs continued when the factory was shut down there were no shutdowns in fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005 

  

other factors that impacted gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

•   continued cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques

•   factors impacting the average selling prices of our products

  

  

•   fluctuations in the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and analog products and related serial eeprom products and

•   inventory writeoffs and the sale of inventory that was previously written off

  

during fiscal 2006 we operated at approximately 98 of our fab 2 capacity which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2005 we operated at approximately 96 of our fab 2 capacity which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal 2004 our utilization of fab 4’s total capacity is at relatively low levels although we are utilizing all of the installed equipment base we expect to maintain the current level of capacity utilization at fab 2 and fab 4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

  

the process technologies utilized impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes at march 31 2006 fab 4 predominantly utilized our 05 micron process technology we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs since the closure of fab 1 in june 2003 all of our production has been on 8inch wafers the first quarter of fiscal 2004 approximately 80 of our production was on 8inch wafers 

  

our overall inventory levels were 1150 million at march 31 2006 compared to 1037 million at march 31 2005 and 945 million at march 31 2004 we maintained 106 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2006 compared to 107 days of inventory at march 31 2005 and 101 days at march 31 2004 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption capacity utilization levels particularly those at fab 4 and competitive and economic conditions 

  

at march 31 2006 approximately 66 of our assembly requirements were performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 70 as of march 31 2005 and approximately 71 at march 31 2004 contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements were performed in our thailand facility over the last three fiscal years we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication requirements 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2006 were 949 million or 102 of sales compared to 930 million or 110 of sales for fiscal 2005 and 854 million or 122 of sales for fiscal 2004 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position we expense all rd costs as incurred rd expenses include expenditures for labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses increased 19 million or 20 for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was higher labor and recruitment costs as a result of expanding our technical resources and increases in bonuses rd expenses increased 76 million or 90 for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was higher labor costs as a result of expanding our technical resources and increasing bonuses   

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 were 1296 million or 140 of sales compared to 1112 million or 131 of sales for fiscal 2005 and 924 million or 132 of sales for fiscal 2004 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 184 million or 165 for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 the primary reasons for the dollar increases in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources increases in bonuses and increases in travel expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 188 million or 203 for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources increases in bonuses increases in travel expenses and increases in audit and legal services 

  

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels

in fiscal 2005 we reached an agreement with us philips corporation and philips electronics north america corp together “philips” regarding patent license litigation between philips and ourselves the agreement included dismissal of the then pending litigation and the crosslicense of certain patents between philips and microchip we recorded a special charge of 211 million in the quarter ended june 30 2004 associated with this matter as part of the settlement we licensed certain of our patents related to 8pin microcontrollers to philips and philips licensed its patents related to i 2 c serial communications to us each on fullypaid up nonroyalty bearing worldwide licenses the definitive agreement related to this matter was finalized and executed and we made a cash payment to philips during our fiscal quarter ending september 30 2004

  

fiscal 2004 

  

fab 1 closure and special charges 

  

on april 7 2003 we announced our intention to close our chandler arizona fab 1 wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain fab 1 personnel and processes into our tempe arizona fab 2 wafer fabrication facility we completed this integration process during the threemonth period ended june 30 2003 the closure of fab 1 and the integration of certain fab 1 personnel into fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of 207 employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing operations or provided support to fab 1 the detail of the charges incurred related to the closure of fab 1 that were included in cost of sales for the threemonth period ended june 30 2003 is as follows amounts in thousands 

  

  

 

  

for the quarter ended june 30 2003 operating expense included 1612000 of special charges recorded principally for contract cancellation severance and other costs related to the closure of fab 1 and other actions we incurred 865000 of such expenditures during fiscal 2004 we reversed 747000 of the special charges recorded in the quarter ended june 30 2003 in the quarter ended december 31 2003 as a result of a favorable outcome in the settlement of a contract cancellation 

  

the facility where fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall campus in chandler arizona within this same facility resides our wafer probe mask making and other manufacturing related activities the accelerated depreciation that was taken only related to assets used in the wafer fabrication operations at the facility the property plant and equipment that was subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property plant and equipment section of our balance sheet and related footnote disclosures 

  

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2006 increased from interest income in fiscal 2005 as our average invested balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and we earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances interest income in fiscal 2005 increased from interest income in fiscal 2004 as our average invested balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and we extended the average maturity term of our invested balances and thus earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate was 325 in fiscal 2006 229 in fiscal 2005 and 228 in fiscal 2004 and is lower than statutory rates in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations rd tax credits and export sales incentives our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 reflects a 306 million tax expense related to the repatriation of 500 million of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act the “jobs act” that was effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 by 85 

  

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the irs for our fiscal years ended march 31 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 as part of this ongoing audit the irs has proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these returns the irs has issued formal assessments for these adjustments we do not agree with these adjustments and are appealing these assessments we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the appeals process with the irs the irs recently began an audit of our fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon these and other audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than any final assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times beginning in september 2006 we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our overall tax expense due to other tax holidays and an increase in income in other taxing jurisdictions with lower statutory rates 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 12851 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments at march 31 2006 an increase of 5505 million from the march 31 2005 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to our cash flows generated from operations and to a lesser extent from increases in shortterm borrowings 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 4373 million for fiscal 2006 3527 million for fiscal 2005 and 3431 million for fiscal 2004 the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to increases in net income and changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 1366 million for fiscal 2006 3707 million for fiscal 2005 and 2676 million in fiscal 2004 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was primarily due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of investments the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of investments 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 763 million in fiscal 2006 632 million in fiscal 2005 and 635 million in fiscal 2004 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was to fund capital expansion activities in our manufacturing operations we currently intend to spend approximately 80 million during the next 12 months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

we expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 1958 million for fiscal 2006 net cash used in financing activities was 186 million for fiscal 2005 and 240 million for fiscal 2004 proceeds from the sale of stock the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were 958 million for fiscal 2006 472 million for fiscal 2005 and 532 million for fiscal 2004 cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 33 million in fiscal 2006 683 million in fiscal 2005 and 539 million in fiscal 2004 we had shortterm borrowings of 2690 million at march 31 2006 and 455 million at march 31 2005 the shortterm borrowings of 2690 million at march 31 2006 relate to transactions associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the jobs act during fiscal 2006 we paid down 455 million in shortterm borrowings and initiated new borrowings of 2690 million to complete the repatriation of 500 million we initiated the 2690 million in borrowings which were collateralized against investments that are held in the foreign locations allowing the investments to reach their normal maturity date we presently intend to pay down the shortterm borrowings as those investments mature and new cash is generated in the foreign locations the shortterm debt is a result of repurchase agreements that are in place with two investment firms 

  

on march 11 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2006 we had repurchased the entire 2500000 common shares under this authorization for a total of 661 million on april 22 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2006 we had repurchased 1004834 common shares under this authorization for a total of 266 million as of march 31 2006 all of the purchased shares under both authorizations had been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations 

  

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 40 million we have continued to pay quarterly dividends and have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular basis during fiscal 2004 we paid dividends in the amount of 0113 per share for a total dividend payment of 233 million during fiscal 2005 we paid dividends in the amount of 0208 per share for a total dividend payment of 430 million during fiscal 2006 we paid dividends in the amount of 057 per share for a total dividend payment of 1201 million on april 25 2006 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0215 per share which was paid on may 23 2006 to stockholders of record on may 9 2006 and the total amount of such dividend was 460 million our board is free to change its dividend practices at any time and to decrease or increase the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the 

  

  

basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

  

we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future the hedging transactions outstanding at march 31 2006 were immaterial 

  

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix and competitive factors there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

  

   

   

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on microchip and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these 

  

  

contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of march 31 2006 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 3a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

during december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123r” sharebased payment a revision of sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 and its related implementation guidance the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions sfas no 123r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award on march 29 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab no 107” which provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies 

  

sfas no 123r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 

  

1 a “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 123r that remain unvested on the effective date 

  

2 a “modified retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 

  

this statement is effective for the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 therefore we will adopt the standard effective april 1 2006 using the modified prospective method as permitted by sfas no 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 25 and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options although we have not completed our assessment we believe the impact on our consolidated financial position or results or operations will be material given the current number of outstanding stock options the effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options using the blackscholesmerton method is presented in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note 1 sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature the standard also requires that tax benefits must be realized through a reduction of income taxes that would otherwise have been paid before the benefit can be recorded this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and may increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things the form of equity compensation the number of grants and when employees exercise stock options 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities and money market funds that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 12851 million as of march 31 2006 and 7287 million as of march 31 2005 these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 

  

  

   

we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant approximately 99 of our sales are denominated in us dollars we maintain hedges related to our foreign currency exposure of our net investment in a foreign operation as needed there were 

no hedges outstanding as of march 31 2005 the amounts of the hedges outstanding as of march 31 2006 and march 31 2004 were immaterial if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates at march 31 2006 and march 31 2005 the effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be material 

  

during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discuss in this item 7a and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k as required by paragraph b of rule 13a15 or rule 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we evaluated under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

  

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 

  

  

of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2006 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment this assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our finance organization 

  

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp who also audited the company’s consolidated financial statements audited management’s assessment and independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp has issued their attestation report which is included in part ii item 9a of this form 10k 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

during the three months ended march 31 2006 there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of rule 13a15 or rule 15d15 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

attestation report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

the board of directors and stockholders of 

microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting that microchip technology incorporated and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria microchip technology incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that microchip technology incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion microchip technology incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2006 based on the coso criteria  

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the march 31 2006 consolidated financial statements of microchip technology incorporated and our report dated may 17 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

•   differentiate their products

•   replace less efficient electromechanical control devices

•   reduce the number of components in their system

•   add product functionality

•   decrease time to market for their products and

•   significantly reduce product cost

  

  

embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of applications and markets worldwide including 

  

• automotive comfort safety and entertainment applications

• remote control devices

• handheld tools

• home appliances

• portable computers

• robotics

• cordless and cellular telephone accessories

• motor controls

• security systems

• educational and entertainment devices and

• consumer electronics

  

embedded control systems also facilitate the emergence of new classes of products when applications not previously existing become possible embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms and various analog and interface products 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the largest segments of the semiconductor market microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures although 4bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive they generally lack the minimum functionality required in most applications and are typically used in relatively simple applications while traditional 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers provide very high performance and functionality they are generally too expensive for many highvolume embedded control applications as a result many manufacturers of competitive highvolume products have found 8bit microcontrollers to be the most costeffective embedded control solution 

  

most microcontrollers shipped today are rombased and must be programmed by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing resulting in 812week lead times based on market conditions for delivery of such microcontrollers in addition to delayed product introduction these long lead times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required to address these issues some suppliers offer programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the customer’s manufacturing line thus significantly reducing leadtime and inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur while these microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to rombased microcontrollers manufacturing technology has evolved over the last several years to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over rombased microcontrollers thus providing significant value to microcontroller customers as a result reprogrammable microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the microcontroller market

we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the development and production of our pic ® family of microcontroller products our extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced low cost user programmability feature by incorporating nonvolatile memory such as flash eeprom and eprom memory into the microcontroller and to be a leader in reprogrammable microcontroller product offerings 

  

digital signal controllers 

  

we recently began production shipments of our digital signal controller product line our family of dspic ® digital signal controllers currently 19 products integrates control features of highperformance 16bit microcontrollers with the processing capabilities of digital signal processors dsps during the last three fiscal years all of our digital signal controller product development has been focused on reprogrammable flash products these controllers integrate a wide variety of peripheral functions making them suitable for a large number of embedded control applications 

  

our dspic product family offers a broad suite of hardware and software development tools software application libraries development boards and reference designs to ease and expedite the customer application development cycle with its fieldreprogrammability large selection of peripheral functions small footprint and ease of use we believe that our dspic controllers will significantly enlarge our addressable market 

  

development systems 

  

we offer a comprehensive set of lowcost and easytolearn application development tools these tools enable system designers to quickly and easily program a pic microcontroller and dspic digital signal controllers for specific applications and are a key factor for obtaining design wins 

  

our family of development tools operates in the standard windows ® environment on standard pc hardware these tools range from entrylevel systems which include an assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware to fully configured systems that provide incircuit emulation hardware customers moving from entrylevel designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future pic devices since all of our systems share the same integrated development environment 

  

many independent companies also develop and market application development tools and systems that support our standard microcontroller product architecture currently there are more than 150 thirdparty tool suppliers worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture 

  

we believe that familiarity with and adoption of our and thirdparty development systems by an increasing number of product designers will be an important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these development tools allow design engineers to develop thousands of applicationspecific products from our standard microcontrollers to date we have shipped more than 358000 development systems 

  

  

assps   our applicationspecific standard products referred to as assps are specialized products designed to perform specific enduser applications compared to our other products that are more general purpose in nature our assp device families currently include among others our keeloq ® family of secure data transmission products and smart battery management products 

  

analog and interface products 

  

our analog and interface products now consist of several families with over 420 power management linear mixedsignal thermal management and interface products at the end of fiscal 2005 our mixedsignal analog and interface products were being shipped to more than 9500 end customers 

  

we continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy as well as to new customers in addition to our “attach” strategy we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional pic microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on an application segment approach targeted to solve different problems in development of our customers’ products 

  

memory products 

  

our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory referred to as eeproms we sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide eeprom products are used for nonvolatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods serial eeproms have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small devices 

  

we address customer requirements by offering products with extremely small package sizes and very low operating voltages for both read and write functions our memory products also feature long data retention and high erasewrite endurance 

  

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing proprietary statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

  

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

•   tempe arizona fab 2

•   chandler arizona probe operations

•   puyallup washington fab 3 nonoperational

•   gresham oregon fab 4 and

•   bangkok thailand assembly and test

  

wafer fabrication   fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes between 035 and 50 microns during fiscal 2005 fab 2 operated at approximately 96 of its capacity compared to approximately 91 during fiscal 2004 operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive impact on our operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in wafer fabrication manufacturing 

  

  

on june 30 2003 we completed closure of our chandler arizona fab 1 wafer fabrication facility and integrated certain fab 1 personnel and processes into our tempe arizona fab 2 wafer fabrication facility the facility where fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall campus in chandler arizona within this same facility resides our wafer probe mask making and other manufacturing related activities we have no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations and intend to leave it in an idle status 

  

fab 3 is currently nonoperational and being held for future use see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – special charges – fab 3 impairment charge ” below at page 33 for a discussion of the status of fab 3 

  

fab 4 was acquired by us in august 2002 and began production on october 31 2003 fab 4 produces 8inch wafers using 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns fab 4 has reached a level of production where costs and efficiencies have met our initial expectations fab 4 costs on comparable technologies are in fact lower than those of fab 2 we have a significant amount of clean room capacity and equipment still to be placed in service at fab 4 that was acquired in the original acquisition of fab 4 that we can bring on line in the future to support incremental wafer fabrication capacity needs we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 3 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand 

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive our future operating results could be adversely affected if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

  

we also contract with thirdparty wafer foundries to fabricate less than 3 of our total production on a strategic basis we will continue to use thirdparty foundries to shorten our product design cycle on certain key technologies and products 

  

assembly and test   we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand at march 31 2005 approximately 70 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2005 our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production a 67000 square foot expansion area that was placed in service in fiscal 2005 provides the thailand facility with sufficient space for our projected expansion needs in fiscal 2006 we also use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations   we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computer aided design tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results during fiscal 2005 our focus on manufacturing productivity allowed us to maintain excellent manufacturing yields at our facilities our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and selective upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

  

  

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards in addition the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources could harm our business 

  

our reliance on third parties for a portion of wafer fabrication and assembly and testing involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of these thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

the foregoing statements related to the combined capacity of fab 2 fab 4 and fab 3 providing sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to future increases in demand and the transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others changes in utilization of our current manufacturing capacity unanticipated costs in ramping production at fab 4 our ability to increase production at fab 2 the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the portland oregon area changes in demand for products and the products of our customers supply disruption absorption of fixed costs labor and other direct manufacturing costs fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization changes in product mix competitive pressures on prices labor unrest political instability and expropriation and other general economic conditions 

  

at the end of fiscal 2005 we owned longlived assets consisting of property plant and equipment and goodwill in the united states amounting to 6223 million and 1029 million in other countries including 1006 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2004 we owned longlived assets in the united states amounting to 6083 million and 1132 million in other countries including 1117 million in thailand 

  

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers assps memory and mixedsignal products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2005 our rd expenses were 930 million compared to 854 million in fiscal 2004 and 880 million in fiscal 2003 

  

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market the majority of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

  

  

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base 

  

in fiscal 2005 we derived 65 of our net sales from sales through distributors and 35 of our net sales from direct sales to original equipment manufacturers referred to as oem customers distributors accounted for 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and 60 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 our largest distributor accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 our second largest distributor accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2003 one distributor accounted for 12 of our net sales no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 2004 or 2003 

  

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on our revenue 

  

we also grant certain credits to our thirdparty distributors and also offer these distributors price protection the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

  

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to thirdparty distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against their outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory they have on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protection activity 

  

we do not offer material incentive programs to our thirdparty distributors 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

sales by geography   sales by geography for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

 

  

sales to customers in asia have increased as a percentage of sales from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 and from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 we attribute this primarily to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 73 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and 71 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

  

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 16 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2005 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during fiscal 2005 2004 or 2003 

  

our international sales are predominately us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties as a result of export restrictions to date 

  

our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks as described under the heading “we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks ” on page 16 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 29 2005 our backlog was approximately 1669 million compared to 2099 million as of april 23 2004 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

  

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products emerging companies may also increase their participation in the market for embedded control applications furthermore capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position 

  

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

• speed

• functionality

• density

• power consumption

• reliability

• packaging alternatives

• price and

• availability

  

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

•   ease of use

•   functionality of application development systems

•   dependable delivery and quality and

•   technical service and support

  

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of united states and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2005 and 2023 we also have numerous additional united states and foreign patent applications pending we do not expect that the expiration of any particular patent will have a material impact on our business while we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative capabilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our 

  

  

patents our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

  

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and require significant attention from management may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to control adequately the storage use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of or to restrict adequately the discharge of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of april 30 2005 we had 3943 employees none of our employees are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good 

  

executive officers 

  

the following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of april 23 2005

additional factors that may affect our results of operations 

  

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

  

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability  

  

our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

•   changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers

•   the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory

•   levels of inventories at our customers

•   changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields

•   our ability to secure sufficient assembly and testing capacity

•   competitive developments including pricing pressures

•   the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter

•   the level of sellthrough of our products through distribution

•   changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality

•   constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability to ship their products which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers

•   costs and outcomes of any tax audits or any litigation involving intellectual property customers or other issues

•   disruptions in our business or our customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity armed conflict war worldwide oil prices and supply public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system

•   property damage or other losses which are not covered by insurance and

•   general economic industry or political conditions in the united states or internationally

  

  

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

  

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

  

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

  

our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins 

  

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

  

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have proven our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results may suffer 

  

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market for embedded control applications we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including 

  

•   the quality performance reliability features ease of use pricing and diversity of our products

•   our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies

•   the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own applications

•   product introductions by our competitors

•   the number nature and success of our competitors in a given market

•   our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices

•   our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights

•   the quality of our customer service and our ability to address the needs of our customers and

•   general market and economic conditions

  

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time 

  

  

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest pricing declines in certain of our more mature proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products 

  

we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely impact our operating results 

  

our business is highly dependent on selling through distributors 

  

sales through distributors accounted for 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and 60 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and approximately 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice 

  

the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

  

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including 

  

•   proper new product selection

•   timely completion and introduction of new product designs

•   development of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and

•   market acceptance of our customers’ end products

  

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

  

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

  

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 

  

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel is intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

  

we are dependent on several thirdparty contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us 

  

we use several thirdparty contractors located in asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of our wafer fabrication although we own the majority of our manufacturing resources the disruption or termination of any of our thirdparty contractors could harm our business and operating results 

  

  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor were to experience financial operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels or if due to their locations in foreign countries they were to experience political upheaval or infrastructure disruption in such case we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us in such event our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

  

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

  

our operating results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by wide fluctuations of supply and demand the industry has experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and expect in the future to experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

  

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

  

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters from october 2001 to october 2004 we were involved in patent infringement litigation with philips corporation which has since been settled however as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers from time to time who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend our position we could incur uninsured liability in any one of them and our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

it is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses related to the defense of such claims or any requirement to pay damages claims we do have product liability insurance but there is no certainty that insurance will cover all claims or be of a sufficient amount to fully protect against such claims costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty or product liability claims may adversely affect the results of our operations 

  

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

  

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us 

  

  

we do not have longterm contracts with our customers  

  

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer in the event of any early termination of a contract by one of our major customers it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly replace that revenue source which could harm our financial results 

  

business interruptions could harm our business 

  

operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism or security risk political instability public health issues telecommunications transportation or other infrastructure failure fire earthquake floods or other natural disasters if operations at any of our facilities or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis if this occurs we would likely experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers in addition business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

  

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

  

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2005 approximately 73 of our net sales were made to foreign customers during fiscal 2004 approximately 71 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand we also use various foreign thirdparty contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

  

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including 

  

•   political social and economic instability

•   public health conditions

•   trade restrictions and changes in tariffs

•   import and export license requirements and restrictions

•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations

•   employment regulations

•   disruptions in international transport or delivery

•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates

•   difficulties in collecting receivables

•   economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us and

•   potentially adverse tax consequences

  

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

  

we are subject to stringent environmental regulations which may force us to incur significant expenses 

  

we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or a cessation of operations any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities 

  

  

further certain of our customers shipping their products into european markets are also subject to governmental environmental regulations such as the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs which will be effective july 1 2006 and the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment these directives focus on limiting the amounts of certain elements such as lead in electrical devices and providing for the proper disposal of the electrical devices and their components the inability of this subset of our customers to use microchip products which contain lead after july 2006 may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related regulations have resulted in increased costs to us 

  

recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and recent rules enacted and proposed by the sec nasdaq and the nyse have resulted in significantly increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements in particular complying with the internal control audit requirements of sarbanesoxley section 404 has resulted in increased internal efforts and significantly higher fees from our independent accounting firm 

  

this report on form 10k contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2005 this form 10k also contains an attestation and report by our auditors with respect to our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section 404 while these assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting compliance with section 404 is an ongoing process and will be required for each future fiscal year we expect that the ongoing compliance with section 404 will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses with not be identified in future periods any adverse results from such ongoing compliance efforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

  

recent regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our earnings and our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

  

since our inception we have used stock options and other longterm equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages and have accounted for them using the intrinsic value method of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” we believe that stock options and other longterm equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use no of vesting encourage employees to remain with microchip in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payments” sfas 123r which changed us generally accepted accounting principles in such a way to require us to record a charge to earnings for the fair value of employee stock option grants and other share based compensation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 this regulation will negatively impact our earnings for those share based awards that vest beginning in fiscal 2007 for example recording a charge for employee stock options under sfas 123 would have decreased our net income by 372 million 368 million and 362 million for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the impact on net income of sfas 123r may differ significantly than the impact as calculated under sfas 123 furthermore adoption of sfas 123r will require us to make certain assumptions and judgments in the valuation of stock options that we may grant in the future a change in any of those assumptions or judgments could change the compensation expense that is charged against our earnings and consequently adversely affect our results of operations see also note 1 to the consolidated financial statements – significant accounting policies sharebased payment 

  

in addition recent regulations implemented by the nasdaq stock market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans as well as recent regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equitycompensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant equitybased awards to employees in the future to the extent that these or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees we may incur compensation costs productivity losses change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

  

•   quarterly variations in our operating results and the operating results of other technology companies

•   actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors

•   changes in analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or buysell recommendations

•   changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance

•   general conditions in the semiconductor industry and

•   worldwide economic and financial conditions

  

in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our common stock 

  










 item 2   properties

  

at march 31 2005 we owned the facilities described below 

  

   

   

in addition to the facilities we own we lease several research and development facilities and sales offices in north america europe and asia our aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately 04 million 

  

we currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our production requirements for the next 12 months 

  

the foregoing statements related to the acquisition of title to the land on which the thailand facility is situated and the adequacy of existing facilities for the next 12 months are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others developments in the financial restructuring of the seller of the land where the thailand facility is situated demand for our products fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization competitive pressures on prices political instability and expropriation and other economic conditions see also the factors set forth under “item 1 – business – additional factors that may affect results of operations” beginning at page 12 of this report 

  

  




 item 3   legal proceedings

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them although the outcome of these actions is not presently determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not harm our business and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or results of operations litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future

 item 7    management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our strategy financial performance and revenue sources we use words such as “anticipate” “believe” “plan” “expect” “estimate” “future” “intend” and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in this item 7 and under “item 1 – business – additional factors that may affect our results of operations” beginning at page 12 above and elsewhere in this form 10k although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forwardlooking statement 

  

we begin our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of microchip’s overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 26 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements”   this mda should be read in conjunction with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 1 – business” “item 6 – selected financial data” and “item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

strategy   our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices and complementary microperipheral products including interface devices serial eeproms and our patented keeloq security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

  

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing proprietary statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit margin 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers digital signal controllers assps memory and mixedsignal products new development systems software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general   our discussion and analysis of microchip’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment and assets held for sale and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policy regarding revenue recognition to oems however we do not believe these policies require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective as our policies described below 

  

  

revenue recognition – distributors 

  

our distributors worldwide have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to thirdparty distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue impact from the price protections we also grant certain credits to our thirdparty distributors the credits are granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide documentation of the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved and the sale and the gross margin are deferred and are reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their customers we changed our revenue recognition policy as it relates to sales to asia regional distributors during fiscal 2003 as described below at page 36 and in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements to conform with our revenue recognition policies for our distribution channels in the americas and europe 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout fifo method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our reserves for obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is “more likely than not” that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2005 our gross deferred tax asset was 1051 million 

  

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the united states internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years ended march 31 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 as part of this ongoing audit the irs has proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these returns the irs has issued formal assessments for these adjustments we do not agree with these adjustments and intend to appeal these assessments we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the appeals process with the irs we also believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon other audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

  

the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others results of any audit conducted by the various taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits available from our deferred tax assets current and future tax laws and regulations and taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations 

  

property plant  equipment 

  

property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred at march 31 2005 the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled 6933 million which represents 381 of our total assets this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30 years on buildings 

  

we began production activities at fab 4 on october 31 2003 we began to depreciate the fab 4 assets as the assets were placed in service for production purposes as of march 31 2005 all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service all manufacturing equipment that was not being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management believes there is no change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into productive service the lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets 

  

on march 31 2005 we changed the classification of fab 3 from an asset heldforsale to an asset heldforfutureuse fab 3 had been on the market for over two years and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility over that period of time our business had increased significantly and over the next several years we will need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of fab 4’s clean room capacity is utilized we determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing the fab 3 facility and hold it for our future use as a result of this change in classification we had to assess the fair value of the fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification from “heldforsale” to “heldforfutureuse” under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the asset the discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of the fab 3 asset at march 31 2005 was not in excess of its fair value if indicators of impairment for the fab 3 assets arise in the future we will determine if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value if less we would recognize an impairment loss on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values we will begin to depreciate the fab 3 asset in april 2005 

  

the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

  

we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility resides the land is subject to a complex restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land however timing of the resolution is difficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change 

  

impairment of property plant and equipment 

  

we assess whether indicators of impairment of longlived assets are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value if less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods if the assets determined to 

  

  

be impaired are to be held and used we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset we may incur impairment losses or additional losses on already impaired assets in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 

  

litigation 

  

our current estimated range of liability related to certain pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss recorded reserves were not significant at march 31 2005 

  

because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 

  

   

net sales   we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 

  

our net sales of 8469 million in fiscal 2005 increased by 1476 million or 211 over fiscal 2004 and net sales of 6993 million in fiscal 2004 increased by 478 million or 73 over fiscal 2003 the increases in net sales in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from increased demand predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller products average selling prices for our products were down approximately 4 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 and 9 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 the number of units of our products sold was up approximately 26 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 and 17 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years key factors in achieving the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

  

•   continued market share gains

•   increasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products

•   customers’ increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions

•   our new product offerings that have increased our served available market and

•   increasing demand for our products

  

we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems under our shipping terms legal title passes to the customer upon shipment from microchip we have no post shipment obligations distributors worldwide generally have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributors sell the 

  

  

product to their customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors are included in accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributors to their customers 

  

during the quarter ended december 31 2003 we changed our accounting policy relating to amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs to be consistent with eitf 0010 with this change we have reclassified amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs from a reduction of cost of sales to revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 and we have continued this treatment in all subsequent periods this reclassification had no impact on net income and an immaterial impact on revenues and cost of sales prior year amounts have not been reclassified as these amounts were immaterial 

  

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 

  

microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 797 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 approximately 796 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 793 of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 212 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and increased approximately 78 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 the increases in net sales were primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets driven principally by market share gains and those factors described above under “ net sales ” at page 26 the end markets that we serve include the automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control markets 

  

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have in the past been able to and expect in the future to be able to moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features at higher prices however we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 136 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 approximately 131 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 134 of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 

  

net sales of our memory products increased approximately 256 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and increased approximately 51 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales 

  

serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle during the past three fiscal years we have experienced several serial eeprom product pricing trends both up and down due to market 

  

  

conditions we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog and interface products 

  

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 67 of our total net sales in fiscal 2005 73 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 73 of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 

  

net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 119 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and increased approximately 61 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 the increase in net sales of our analog and interface products in these periods were driven primarily by new proprietary design wins supply and demand conditions within the market and our ability to gain market share 

  

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than half of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which could adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products to increase over time 

  

turns orders 

  

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment targets that we set entering the quarter historically we have proven our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times turns orders are difficult to predict and we may not experience the combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in a quarter that would be sufficient to achieve anticipated net sales if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter our net sales and operating results may suffer 

  

the foregoing statements regarding competitive pricing pressure in our microcontroller serial eeprom and analog and interface product lines our ability to moderate future average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines and the proprietary portion of our analog and interface product lines increasing over time are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual orders and sales inventory mix and timing of customer orders customers’ inventory levels order patterns and seasonality level of sellthrough of our products through distribution in any particular fiscal period our ability to ramp products into volume production competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability disruptions in commercial activities or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers the financial condition of our customers fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization changes in product mix absorption of fixed costs labor and other fixed manufacturing costs and general industry economic and political conditions 

  

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and 60 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 

  

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 our two largest distributors accounted for 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2005 distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 23 months of inventory of our products over the past three fiscal years the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 20 months and 28 months thus inventory levels at our distributors are at the low to moderate end of the range we have experienced over the last three years as we recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales 

  

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on revenue recognition 

  

we also grant certain credits to our thirdparty distributors and also offer these distributors price protection the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

  

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to thirdparty distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protections 

  

we do not offer material incentive programs to our thirdparty distributors 

  

the foregoing statements regarding our expectation that distributors will increase their current inventory levels and our belief that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will not materially impact our net sales are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others the rate of recovery in the overall economy and the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual orders and sales inventory mix and timing of customer orders customers’ inventory levels order patterns and seasonality the impact on our business and customer order patterns due to major public health concerns such as the sars virus level of sellthrough of our products through distribution in any particular fiscal period disruptions in commercial activities or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers and the financial condition of our customers 

  

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america sales to customers in asia have increased during the last three fiscal years due to many of our customers transitioning their manufacturing operations to asia 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 73 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 and 71 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 substantially all of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 16 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 sales to customers in taiwan accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2005 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the last three fiscal years 

  

gross profit   our gross profit was 4840 million in fiscal 2005 3500 million in fiscal 2004 and 3522 million in fiscal 2003 gross profit as a percent of sales was 571 in fiscal 2005 500 in fiscal 2004 and 541 in fiscal 2003   the most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage over the past three fiscal years were 

  

•   improvements in capacity utilization and product absorption which positively affected gross margin by 118 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and by 104 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003

•   318 million in accelerated depreciation and other costs associated with the closure of fab 1 which negatively affected gross margin in fiscal 2004

•   changes in period cost of sales in fab 3 and fab 4 our nonoperational facilities at certain times during the last three fiscal years which negatively impact gross margin period cost of sales amounted to 33 million in fiscal 2005 181 million in fiscal 2004 and 131 million in fiscal 2003

•   a oneweek unpaid shutdown negatively affecting gross profit by 17 million in fiscal 2004 the shutdown occurred in the three months ended september 30 2003 and had a negative impact on gross profit due to the fact that certain fixed costs including depreciation utilities property taxes and other ongoing costs continued when the factory was shut down there were no shutdowns in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2003

  

other factors that impacted gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

•   continued cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques

•   factors impacting the average selling prices of our products

•   fluctuations in the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and analog products and related serial eeprom products and

•   inventory writeoffs and the sale of inventory that was previously written off

  

  

during fiscal 2005 we operated at approximately 96 of our fab 2 capacity which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2004 we operated at approximately 91 of our fab 2 capacity which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2003 we operated at approximately 85 of our cumulative total fab 1 and fab 2 capacity our utilization of fab 4’s total capacity is at relatively low levels although we are utilizing all of the installed equipment base we expect to maintain the current level of capacity utilization at fab 2 and fab 4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

  

the process technologies utilized impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes fab 4 currently utilizes our 05 micron process technology we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs since the closure of fab 1 in june 2003 all of our production has been on 8inch wafers in fiscal 2003 and the first quarter of fiscal 2004 approximately 80 of our production was on 8inch wafers 

  

our overall inventory levels were 1037 million at march 31 2005 compared to 945 million at march 31 2004 and 1023 million at march 31 2003 we maintained 107 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2005 compared to 101 days of inventory at march 31 2004 and 128 days at march 31 2003 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption capacity utilization levels particularly those at fab 4 and competitive and economic conditions 

  

the foregoing statements relating to our expectation to maintain the current level of capacity utilization at fab 2 and fab 4 during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 our transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs and the fluctuation of gross margins over time are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization absorption of fixed costs labor and other direct manufacturing costs competition and competitive pressure on pricing disruptions in commercial activities or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability our ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed cost and availability of raw materials changes in product mix and other general industry economic and political conditions 

  

at march 31 2005 approximately 70 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 71 as of march 31 2004 and approximately 77 at march 31 2003 thirdparty contractors located in asia perform the balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements were being performed in our thailand facility over the last three fiscal years we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to thirdparty contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

we rely on outside wafer foundries for a small portion of our wafer fabrication requirements 

  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2005 were 930 million or 110 of sales compared to 854 million or 122 of sales for fiscal 2004 and 880 million or 135 of sales for fiscal 2003 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position we expense all rd costs as incurred rd expenses include expenditures for labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

  

rd expenses increased 76 million or 90 for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was higher labor costs as a result of expanding our technical resources and increases in bonuses rd expenses decreased 26 million or 30 for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 the primary reasons for the dollar decrease in rd costs in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 were reductions in professional services and lower costs associated with product prototyping which were partially offset by increases in labor costs 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2005 were 1112 million or 131 of sales compared to 924 million or 132 of sales for fiscal 2004 and 894 million or 137 of sales for fiscal 2003 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 188 million or 203 for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 the primary reasons for the dollar increases in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 were higher labor costs as a result of expanding our internal resources increases in bonuses increases in travel expenses and increases in audit and legal services selling general and administrative expenses increased 30 million or 34 for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 were increases in labor costs and travel expenses 

  

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

special charges   the following table presents a summary of special charges for the fiscal years ended march 31 2005 2004 and 2003 dollars in thousands 

  

   

fiscal 2005 

  

settlement with us philips corporation 

  

we reached an agreement with us philips corporation and philips electronics north america corp together “philips” regarding patent license litigation between philips and ourselves which had been ongoing from october 2001 to october 2004 the agreement includes dismissal of the then pending litigation and the crosslicense of certain patents between philips and microchip we recorded a special charge of 211 million in the quarter ended june 30 2004 associated with this matter as part of the settlement we licensed certain of our patents related to 8pin microcontrollers to philips and philips licensed its patents related to i 2 c serial communications to us each on fullypaid up nonroyalty bearing worldwide licenses the definitive agreement related to this matter was finalized and executed and the cash payment was made by us to philips during our fiscal quarter ending september 30 2004 

  

  

fiscal 2004 

  

fab 1 closure and special charges

  

on april 7 2003 we announced our intention to close our chandler arizona fab 1 wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain fab 1 personnel and processes into our tempe arizona fab 2 wafer fabrication facility we completed this integration process during the threemonth period ended june 30 2003 the closure of fab 1 and the integration of certain fab 1 personnel into fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of 207 employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing operations or provided support to fab 1 the detail of the charges incurred related to the closure of fab 1 that were included in cost of sales for the threemonth period ended june 30 2003 is as follows amounts in thousands 

  

 

  

for the quarter ended june 30 2003 operating expense included 1612000 of special charges recorded principally for contract cancellation severance and other costs related to the closure of fab 1 and other actions we incurred 865000 of such expenditures during fiscal 2004 we reversed 747000 of the special charges recorded in the quarter ended june 30 2003 in the quarter ended december 31 2003 as a result of a favorable outcome in the settlement of a contract cancellation 

  

the facility where fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall campus in chandler arizona within this same facility resides our wafer probe mask making and other manufacturing related activities the accelerated depreciation that was taken only related to assets used in the wafer fabrication operations at the facility we have no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations and intend to leave it in an idle status the property plant and equipment that was subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property plant and equipment section of our balance sheet and related footnote disclosures 

  

fiscal 2003 

  

fab 3 impairment charge

  

we recorded a 415 million asset impairment charge during the quarter ended september 30 2002 as described below 

  

we acquired fab 3 a semiconductor manufacturing facility in puyallup washington in july 2000 the original purchase consisted of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real property it was our intention to bring fab 3 to productive readiness and commence volume production of 8inch wafers using our 07 and 05 micron process technologies by august 2001 we delayed our production start up at fab 3 due to deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal 2002 fab 3 has never been brought to productive readiness 

  

on august 23 2002 we acquired fab 4 a semiconductor manufacturing facility in gresham oregon see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements on page f12 below we decided to purchase fab 4 instead of bringing fab 3 to productive readiness because among other things the cost of the manufacturing equipment needed to ramp production at fab 3 over the next several years was significantly higher than the total purchase price of fab 4 and the time to bring fab 4 to productive readiness was significantly less than the time required to bring fab 3 to productive readiness 

  

after the acquisition of fab 4 was completed we undertook an analysis of the potential production capacity at fab 4 the results of the production capacity analysis led us to determine that fab 3’s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the september 2002 quarter we committed to a plan to sell fab 3 at that time we retained a thirdparty broker to market fab 3 on our behalf accordingly fab 3 was classified as an asset heldforsale as of september 30 2002 and maintained that classification until the end of fiscal 2005 

  

management determined the value assigned to the assets through various methods including assistance from a thirdparty appraisal the independent third party used the market approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair value of fab 3 the comparable sales included eight properties including our purchases of fab 3 in july 2000 and fab 4 in august 2002 based on the results of this appraisal we recorded an asset impairment charge on fab 3 of 

  

  

369 million including estimated costs to sell the remaining value of 602 million was classified as an asset heldforsale and was included as a component of other current assets until march 31 2005 

  

during the quarter ended september 30 2002 we also recorded an asset impairment charge of 46 million to writedown certain excess manufacturing equipment located at fab 3 to its net realizable value of 02 million this manufacturing equipment became “excess” as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of fab 4 the net realizable value for the excess manufacturing equipment was determined based on management estimates substantially all of the other manufacturing equipment located at fab 3 has been transferred to and will be used in our other wafer fabrication facilities located in tempe arizona fab 2 and gresham oregon fab 4 

  

at march 31 2005 we changed the classification of fab 3 from an asset heldforsale to an asset heldforfuture use fab 3 consists of manufacturing buildings and land with no equipment fab 3 had been on the market for over two years and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility over that period of time our business has increased significantly and over the next several years we need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of fab 4’s clean room capacity is utilized we determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing the fab 3 facility and hold it for our future use as a result of this change in classification we had to assess the fair value of the fab 3 asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification from “heldforsale” to “heldforfutureuse” under sfas 144 we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the fab 3 asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the asset the discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of the fab 3 asset at march 31 2005 was not in excess of its fair value we will begin to depreciate the fab 3 asset in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

  

powersmart inprocess research and development charge 

  

during the quarter ended june 30 2002 purchased inprocess research and development of 93 million associated with our acquisition of powersmart inc was written off at the date of the acquisition june 5 2002 in accordance with fasb interpretation no 4 “applicability of fasb statement no 2 business combinations accounted for by the purchase method ” “fin 4” powersmart delivered a battery management whole product solution that improves system runtimes with a lower system cost for the user included in the whole product solution is an application tools suite designed to speed up implementation during the user’s development and production the acquisition was intended to strengthen our position in battery management applications such as laptop computers personal digital assistants cellular telephones digital cameras and camcorders 

  

the assets acquired included inprocess research and development for which there is no alternative future use management determined the value assigned to this asset through various methods including assistance from third party appraisal firms in valuing the powersmart business as of the valuation date there were 15 projects that were considered to be in process the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the inprocess projects these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating expenses cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the inprocess technology these net returns were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving commercial readiness the above analysis resulted in 93 million of value assigned to acquired inprocess research and development which was expensed on the acquisition date we believe the assumptions used in valuing inprocess research and development are reasonable but are inherently uncertain 

  

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2005 increased from interest income in fiscal 2004 as our average invested cash balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and we extended the average maturity term of our invested cash balances and thus earned a higher interest rate on our invested balances interest income in fiscal 2004 increased from interest income in fiscal 2003 as our average invested cash balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate was 229 in fiscal 2005 228 in fiscal 2004 and 223 in fiscal 2003 and is lower than statutory rates in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations and rd tax credits 

  

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2005 our gross deferred tax asset was 1051 million 

  

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the united states internal revenue service irs for our fiscal years ended march 31 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 as part of this ongoing audit the irs has proposed certain adjustments related to positions reflected on these returns the irs has issued formal assessments for these adjustments we do not agree with these adjustments and intend to appeal these assessments we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of the pending audit through either settlement or the appeals process with the irs we also believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon other audits in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand although our tax holidays in thailand partially expired in october 2003 our manufacturing operations in thailand are being predominantly conducted using equipment that was invested pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until september 2006 the expiration of a portion of our tax holiday in thailand did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal 2004 

  

the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” enacted on october 22 2004 provides for a temporary deduction of 85 of dividends received on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a oneyear period the deduction would result in an approximate 525 federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings to qualify for the deduction the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company’s chief executive officer and approved by the company’s board of directors certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well the maximum amount of our foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary deduction is 500 million the oneyear period for which we are considering the qualifying distribution is fiscal 2006 

  

we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and if so the amount that will be repatriated the range of reasonably possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation which would be eligible for the temporary deduction is zero to 500 million we are in the process of analyzing and evaluating the recently issued regulatory guidance and statutory technical corrections associated with the jobs act to determine the amount if any we will repatriate we expect to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated if any during fiscal 2006 

  

we are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation should we choose to make one on our income tax expense for fiscal 2006 or the amount of our indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings if we were to plan to repatriate the maximum amount eligible for the temporary deduction which is 500 million from foreign earnings which were previously indefinitely reinvested we estimate we would incur additional tax expense in fiscal 2006 of between 263 million and 287 million 

  

the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset from our future taxable income the adequacy of our tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit the range of possible repatriation amounts and the estimated amount of additional tax expense are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others current and future tax laws and regulations taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations results of any current or future audit conducted by the 

  

  

us internal revenue service or other taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business and the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax asset 

  

change in accounting principle 

  

we had historically recognized revenue from sales to our americas european and multinational asian distributors at point of sale pos or when those distributors sell our products to their customers and prior to fiscal 2003 we recognized revenue on sales to regional asian distributors at point of purchase pop or when we shipped product to these distributors upon shipment amounts billed to distributors at pos are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to its customers 

  

on march 18 2003 we announced that we would change our revenue recognition policy relating to regional asian distributors from pop to pos we believe that revenue recognition at pos for sales to distributors as our sole revenue recognition policy worldwide is a more reflective measure of end customer demand for our products to implement the change in revenue recognition we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 114 million net of income taxes of 66 million as of april 1 2002 the beginning of fiscal 2003 the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was calculated by multiplying the quantity of our inventory that the regional asia distributors maintained as of april 1 2002 by the gross margin we would realize on those sales net of related income tax 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 7346 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at march 31 2005 an increase of 2601 million from the march 31 2004 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to our cash flows generated from operations 

  

during fiscal 2005 we maintained an unsecured shortterm line of credit with various financial institutions in asia which at march 31 2005 totaled 5 million us dollar equivalent there were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march 31 2005 but an allocation of approximately 04 million of the available line was made relating to import guarantees associated with our business in thailand there are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 3527 million for fiscal 2005 3431 million for fiscal 2004 and 2602 million for fiscal 2003 the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to increases in net income 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 3707 million for fiscal 2005 2676 million for fiscal 2004 and 3768 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was due to changes in our net purchases sales and maturities of shortterm investments the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the purchases of fab 4 and powersmart that occurred in fiscal 2003 

  

we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future there were no hedges outstanding as of march 31 2005 

  

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 632 million in fiscal 2005 635 million in fiscal 2004 and 2651 million in fiscal 2003 the primary reason for the dollar decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was a reduced need for additional capital equipment as a result of our purchase of fab 4 during fiscal 2003 we currently intend to spend approximately 55 to 60 million during the next 12 months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

we expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 186 million for fiscal 2005 240 million for fiscal 2004 and 31 million for fiscal 2003 proceeds from the sale of stock the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were 472 million for fiscal 2005 532 million for fiscal 2004 and 315 million for fiscal 2003 cash 

  

  

expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 683 million in fiscal 2005 539 million in fiscal 2004 and 265 million in fiscal 2003 we had shortterm borrowings of 455 million at march 31 2005 the shortterm debt is a result of repurchase agreements that are in place with two investment firms 

  

on march 11 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2005 we had repurchased the entire 2500000 common shares under this authorization for a total of 661 million on april 22 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2005 we had repurchased 884900 common shares under this authorization for a total of 233 million as of march 31 2005 all but 818332 of the purchased shares under both authorizations had been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations 

  

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 40 million we have continued to pay quarterly dividends and have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular basis during fiscal 2004 we paid dividends in the amount of 0113 per share for a total dividend payment of 233 million during fiscal 2005 we paid dividends in the amount of 0208 per share for a total dividend payment of 430 million on april 27 2005 we declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0095 per share which will be paid on june 3 2005 to stockholders of record on may 13 2005 and is estimated to be 198 million our board is free to change its dividend practices at any time and to decrease or increase the dividend paid or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions and our results of operations 

  

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix and competitive factors there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

  

the foregoing statements regarding our anticipated level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months the nature of such expenditures the financing and sufficiency of our capital expenditures and our belief that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our requirements are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others changes in demand for our products and those of our customers changes in utilization of current manufacturing capacity unanticipated costs in continuing to ramp production at fab 4 market acceptance of our products and of our customers’ products the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products the availability and cost of raw materials equipment and other supplies actual levels of capital expenditures the costs and outcome of any tax audit or any litigation involving intellectual property customer or other issues the financial condition of our customers and vendors uninsured losses and the economic political and other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2005 dollars in thousands 

  

  

   

1   capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property plant and equipment they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of march 31 2005 as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 

  

2   other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses 

  

3   total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 

  

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on microchip and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of march 31 2005 we are not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 3a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

during december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments at fair value sharebased payments include stock option grants we grant options to purchase common stock to some of our employees and directors under our stock option plan at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the dates the options were granted sfas no 123r is effective for us beginning april 1 2006 early adoption of the provisions of sfas no 123r is encouraged but not required we have not yet adopted this pronouncement and are currently evaluating the expected impact that the adoption of sfas no 123r will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations we expect the adoption of sfas no 123r will have an unfavorable impact on our consolidated results of operations and net income per common share sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options 

  

  

fasb staff position “fsp” no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” “fsp 1092” provides guidance under fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs creation act” on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability the jobs creation act was enacted on october 22 2004 fsp 1092 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas 109 as of march 31 2005 we are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate any foreign earnings under the act and if so the amount that we will repatriate however we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until later in fiscal 2006 accordingly as provided for in fsp 1092 we have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs creation act the jobs creation act also provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities to be phased in from 2005 through 2010 which is intended to replace the existing extraterritorial income exclusion for foreign sales in fsp 1091 the fasb decided the deduction for qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas 109 rather than as a rate reduction accordingly any benefit from the deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the tax return and no adjustment to deferred taxes at march 31 2005 is required

  

in march 2004 the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” “eitf 031” the issue’s objective is to provide guidance for identifying otherthantemporarily impaired investments eitf 031 also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired in september 2004 the fasb issued a fsp eitf 0311 that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf 031 until further notice the disclosure requirements of eitf 031 are effective with this annual report for fiscal 2005 once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf 031 

  

in december 2004 the fasb also issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” “sfas 151” which will become effective for us beginning january 1 2006 this standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead in addition this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations but do not believe the impact of the change will be material 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 7287 million as of march 31 2005 and 4629 million as of march 31 2004 these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 

  

   

we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant approximately 99 of our sales are denominated in us dollars at times we maintain hedges of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation there were no hedges outstanding as of march 31 2005 the amounts of the hedges outstanding as of march 31 2004 were immaterial if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates at march 31 2005 and march 31 2004 the effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be material 

  

  

during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discuss in this item 7a and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k as required by paragraph b of rule 13a15 or rule 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we evaluated under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e or 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

  

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of march 31 2005 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment this assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by our finance organization 

  

  

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp who also audited the company’s consolidated financial statements audited management’s assessment and independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp has issued their attestation report which is included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

during the three months ended march 31 2005 there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of rule 13a15 or rule 15d15 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

industry background 

  

competitive pressures require manufacturers of a wide variety of products to expand product functionality and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these requirements manufacturers often use integrated circuitbased embedded control systems that enable them to 

  

•   differentiate their products

•   replace less efficient electromechanical control devices

•   reduce the number of components in their system

•   add product functionality

•   decrease time to market for their products and

•   significantly reduce product cost

  

 

embedded control systems also facilitate the emergence of complete new classes of products embedded control systems have been incorporated into thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of markets worldwide including 

  

   

embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may include specialized peripheral device controllers and internal or external nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms to store additional program software and various analog and interface products 

  

the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for microcontrollers one of the largest segments of the semiconductor market microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures although 4bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive they generally lack the minimum performance and features required for product differentiation and are typically used only to produce basic functionality in products while traditional 16 and 32bit architectures provide very high performance they are generally more expensive for most highvolume embedded control applications typically costing significantly more than the cost of an 8bit microcontroller as a result manufacturers of competitive highvolume products have found 8bit microcontrollers to be the most costeffective embedded control solution 

  

most microcontrollers shipped today are rombased and must be programmed by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing resulting in 10 to 12week lead times based on current market conditions for delivery of such microcontrollers in addition to delayed product introduction these long lead times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required to address these issues some suppliers offer programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the customer in the customer’s manufacturing line thus minimizing leadtime and inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur while these microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to rombased microcontrollers manufacturing technology has evolved over the last several years to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for little to no premium over rombased microcontrollers thus providing significant value to microcontroller customers as a result reprogrammable microcontrollers are the fastest growing segment of the 8bit microcontroller market

we continue marketing and selling our analog and interface products into our existing microcontroller customer base which we refer to as our analog “attach” strategy as well as to new customers in addition to our “attach” strategy we market and sell other products that may not fit our traditional pic ® microcontroller and memory products customer base we market these and all of our products based on a “functions” approach targeted to solve different problems in development of our customers’ products 

  

memory products 

  

our memory products consist primarily of serial electrically erasable programmable read only memory referred to as eeproms we sell these devices primarily into the embedded control market and we are one of the largest suppliers of such devices worldwide eeprom products are used for nonvolatile program and data storage in systems where such data must be either modified frequently or retained for long periods serial eeproms have a very low io pin requirement permitting production of very small devices 

  

we address customer requirements by offering products with extremely small package sizes and very low operating voltages for both read and write functions high performance circuitry and microcode are also available to reduce power consumption when a device is not in use while permitting immediate operating capability when required our memory products also feature long data retention and high erasewrite endurance 

  

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing proprietary statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and testing profit margin 

  

our manufacturing facilities are located in 

  

•   chandler arizona probe operations

•   tempe arizona fab 2

•   puyallup washington fab 3 nonoperationalheld for sale

•   gresham oregon fab 4 and

•   bangkok thailand assembly and test

  

wafer fabrication   on april 7 2003 we announced our intention to close our chandler arizona fab 1 wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain fab 1 personnel and processes into our tempe arizona fab 2 wafer fabrication facility we completed this integration process during the threemonth period ended june 30 2003 the closure of fab 1 and the integration of certain fab 1 personnel into our fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of 207 employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing operations or provided support functions to fab 1 

  

 

the facility where fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall campus in chandler arizona within this same facility resides our wafer probe mask making and other manufacturing related activities we have no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations and intend to leave it in an idle status 

  

fab 2 currently produces 8inch wafers and supports manufacturing processes between 035 and 50 microns during fiscal 2004 fab 2 operated at approximately 91 of its capacity compared to approximately 88 during fiscal 2003 operating at higher percentages of capacity has a positive impact on operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in our wafer fabrication manufacturing 

  

fab 3 is nonoperational and is currently classified as an asset heldforsale see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – special charges – fab 3 impairment charge ” below at page 33 for a discussion of the status of fab 3 

  

fab 4 was acquired in august 2002 and began production on october 31 2003 fab 4 produces 8inch wafers using 05 micron manufacturing processes and is capable of supporting technologies below 018 microns we are in the early states of ramping our production activities at fab 4 fab 4 has an installed equipment base that will allow us to produce an additional 600 to 800 million in annual product sales we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand 

  

we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our successful transition to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive our future operating results could be adversely affected if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

  

we also contract with thirdparty wafer foundries to fabricate less than 5 of our total production primarily in our analog and smart battery management product families we have transitioned many of these products to our own wafer fabrication facilities and plan to continue to do so over time on a strategic basis we will continue to use thirdparty foundries to shorten our product design cycle on certain key technologies and products 

  

assembly and test   we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near bangkok thailand at march 31 2004 approximately 71 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2004 our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer production as of april 30 2004 we had substantially completed a 67000 square foot expansion at our thailand facility that once placed in service will increase the facility’s test capacity by approximately 80 the expansion area is expected to be placed in service in fiscal 2005 we also use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements 

  

general matters impacting our manufacturing operations   we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing consistently high manufacturing yields have significant positive effects on our gross profit and overall operating results during fiscal 2004 our focus on manufacturing productivity allowed us to maintain average wafer fab line yields at our facilities in excess of 95 our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee training and selective upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in the achievement of our operating results the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment as is 

  

 

typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

  

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards in addition the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources could harm our business 

  

our reliance on third parties for a portion of wafer fabrication and assembly and testing involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of these thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

the foregoing statements related to the equipment base at fab 4 allowing us to produce an additional 600 to 800 million in annual product sales the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 providing sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to future increases in demand and the transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others changes in utilization of our current manufacturing capacity unanticipated costs in continuing to ramp production at fab 4 our ability to increase production at fab 2 the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the portland oregon area changes in demand for products and the products of our customers changes in demand for our analog and battery management products supply disruption absorption of fixed costs labor and other direct manufacturing costs fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization changes in product mix competitive pressures on prices labor unrest political instability and expropriation and other general economic conditions 

  

research and development rd 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the design of new 8bit microcontrollers 16bit digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products assps new development systems and software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

in fiscal 2004 our rd expenses were 854 million compared to 880 million in fiscal 2003 and 817 million in fiscal 2002 

  

sales and distribution 

  

general 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors 

  

our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market the majority of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

  

 

distribution 

  

our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base 

  

in fiscal 2004 we derived 64 of our net sales from sales through distributors and 36 of our net sales from direct sales to original equipment manufacturers referred to as oem customers distributors accounted for 60 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and 62 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 our two largest distributors combined accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales for fiscal 2004 and 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2003   in fiscal 2004 our two largest distributors accounted for 13 and 12 respectively of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and 2002 one distributor accounted for 12 and 13 respectively of our net sales no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 2003 or 2002 

  

we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on our revenue 

  

we also grant certain credits to our thirdparty distributors and also offer these distributors price protection the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

  

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to thirdparty distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protections 

  

we do not offer material incentive programs to our thirdparty distributors 

  

sales by geography   sales by geography for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 71 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and approximately 69 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 

  

 

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 we did not have sales into any other foreign countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the periods covered by this report 

  

our international sales are predominately us dollar denominated although foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not experienced any material difficulties as a result of export restrictions to date 

  

our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks as described under the heading “we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks ” on page 15 

  

backlog 

  

as of april 23 2004 our backlog was approximately 2099 million compared to 1066 million as of april 25 2003 our backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months 

  

we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the customer’s option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period during the last two quarters of fiscal 2004 our product lead times extended and resulted in customers providing us with additional backlog leading to improved visibility 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products emerging companies may also increase their participation in the market for embedded control applications furthermore capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product availability could adversely affect our competitive position 

  

we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our embedded control products including the following product characteristics 

  

   

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control market include 

  

•   ease of use

•   functionality of application development systems

•   dependable delivery and quality and

•   technical service and support

  

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

patents licenses and trademarks 

  

we maintain a portfolio of united states and foreign patents expiring on various dates between 2005 and 2022 we also have numerous additional united states and foreign patent applications pending while we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes we believe that our continued success depends primarily on the technological 

  

 

skills and innovative abilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product developments rather than on our patents our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

  

we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and divert management effort may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could harm our business see “ item 3 – legal proceedings ” beginning below at page 18 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations any failure by us to control adequately the storage use and disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities 

  

increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations our business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to control the use of or to restrict adequately the discharge of hazardous substances under present or future environmental regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of april 30  2004 we had 3678 employees approximately 43 of our employees work at our thailand facility none of our employees in the us or thailand are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

additional factors that may affect our results of operations 

  

when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission 

  

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability  

  

our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our control some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

•   changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers

•   unanticipated costs or delays in continuing to ramp production at fab 4

•   the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory

•   levels of inventories at our customers

•   changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields

•   our ability to secure sufficient assembly and testing capacity

•   competitive developments including pricing pressures

•   the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter

•   the level of sellthrough of our products through distribution

•   changes or fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality

•   constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability to ship their products which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers

•   costs and outcomes of any tax audits or any litigation involving intellectual property customers or other issues

  

 

•   disruptions in our business or our customers’ businesses due to terrorist activity armed conflict war worldwide oil prices and supply public health concerns or disruptions in the transportation system

•   property damage or other losses which are not covered by insurance and

•   general economic industry or political conditions in the united states or internationally

  

we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

  

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields 

  

the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels 

  

our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less than optimal capacity lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower gross margins 

  

if we do not ramp our production activities at our fab 4 gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility in a timely manner our anticipated revenues and gross margins may be adversely impacted 

  

we acquired fab 4 located in gresham oregon in august 2002 fab 4 commenced production on october 31 2003 bringing fab 4 to higher levels of production involves significant risks including 

  

• successful implementation of our manufacturing processes at fab 4

• potential shortages of materials and skilled labor

• unforeseen environmental or engineering problems and

• unanticipated costs

  

any of these risks could delay the rampup of fab 4 and could result in significant additional costs or reduce our anticipated revenues 

  

as a result of these and other factors fab 4 may not increase production when anticipated or within budget also we may be unable to achieve adequate manufacturing yields in fab 4 in a timely manner and our revenues may not increase in proportion to the anticipated increase in manufacturing capacity associated with fab 4 which would harm our operating results 

  

we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 

  

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we emphasize our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business is relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our visibility on future product shipments the percentage of turns orders in any given quarter fluctuates and depends on overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times 

  

during fiscal 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 our turns orders were at the high end of the range that we have experienced over the last several years during the last two quarters of fiscal 2004 our product lead times began to extend and resulted in customers providing us with additional backlog leading to improved visibility because turns orders are difficult to predict varying levels of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue targets our revenue and operating results will suffer 

  

 

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures reduced sales of our products or reduced market share 

  

the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical marketing distribution and other resources than we do with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market for embedded control applications we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could harm our business 

  

our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control including 

  

•   the quality performance reliability features ease of use pricing and diversity of our products

•   our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies

•   the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own products

•   product introductions by our competitors

•   the number nature and success of our competitors in a given market

•   our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other supplies at acceptable prices

•   our ability to protect our products and processes by effective utilization of intellectual property rights

•   the quality of our customer service and our ability to address the needs of our customers and

•   general market and economic conditions

  

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure in certain of our proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more features and higher prices we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products 

  

we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely impact our operating results 

  

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is intense in our market 

  

our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for qualified engineering and management personnel is intense we may be unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our senior management team 

  

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 

  

our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various factors including 

  

 

•   proper new product selection

•   timely completion and introduction of new product designs

•   development of support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and

•   market acceptance of our customers’ end products

  

because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to time in completing development of new products in addition our new products may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which could adversely impact our future operating results 

  

our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 

  

we are dependent on several thirdparty contractors to perform key manufacturing functions for us 

  

we use several thirdparty contractors located throughout asia for a portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside wafer foundries for a portion of the wafer fabrication of our analog and smart battery management products although we have reduced our dependence on thirdparty contractors over time the disruption or termination of any of these sources could harm our business and operating results our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor were to experience financial operations or production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels in such case we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products on a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us 

  

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet our needs 

  

our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our standards the raw materials and equipment necessary for our business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business 

  

our business is highly dependent on selling through distributors 

  

sales through distributors accounted for 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and 60 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 our two largest distributors together accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 21 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and our distributors may terminate their relationship with us with little or no advanced notice 

  

the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

our operating results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the semiconductor industry 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by wide fluctuations of supply and demand the industry has experienced significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand and production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly 

  

 

replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results and may in the future experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

  

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 

  

we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts and other matters in particular as discussed in part i item 3 of this form 10k  we are presently involved in patent infringement litigation with philips corporation in addition as is typical in the semiconductor industry we receive notifications from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we are not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of a matter obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully prosecute or defend our position our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost revenue or market opportunities 

  

our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us 

  

we do not have longterm contracts with our customers  

  

we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers when we do enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the convenience of the customer in the event of any early termination of a contract by one of our major customers it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly replace that revenue source which would harm our financial results 

  

business interruptions could harm our business 

  

operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or at any of our wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors may be disrupted for reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of terrorism political instability public health issues telecommunications failure fire earthquake floods or other natural disasters if operations at any of our or our subcontractors’ facilities are interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a timely basis if this occurs we may experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of customers in addition business interruption insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

  

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 

  

sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 approximately 71 of our net sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand we also use various foreign thirdparty contractors for a portion of our assembly and testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements for our analog and smart battery management products substantially all of our finished goods inventory is maintained in thailand 

  

 

our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including 

  

•   political social and economic instability

•   trade restrictions and changes in tariffs

•   import and export license requirements and restrictions

•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations

•   employment regulations

•   disruptions in international transport or delivery

•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates

•   difficulties in collecting receivables

•   economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us and

•   potentially adverse tax consequences

  

if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our operating results could suffer 

  

we are subject to stringent environmental regulation which may force us to incur significant expenses 

  

we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or a cessation of operations any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities 

  

recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related regulations could result in increased costs to us 

  

recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and recent rules enacted and proposed by the sec nasdaq and the nyse are resulting in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements in particular complying with the internal control audit requirements of sarbanesoxley section 404 will result in increased internal efforts and higher fees from our independent accounting firm the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance including director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors on committees of our board of directors or as executive officers we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs that we may incur as we implement these new and proposed rules 

  

recent and proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

  

since our inception we have used stock options and other longterm equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages we believe that stock options and other longterm equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use of vesting encourage employees to remain with microchip the financial accounting standards board fasb has proposed changes to us gaap that if implemented would require us to record a charge to earnings for the fair value of employee stock option grants based on vesting beginning in fiscal 2006 this pending regulation would negatively impact our earnings for example recording a charge for employee stock options under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” would have decreased net income by 368 million 362 million and 294 million for fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively see also note 1 to the consolidated financial statements – significant accounting policies stock based compensation in addition new regulations implemented by the nasdaq stock market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans as well as new regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equitycompensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees we may incur compensation costs change our equity compensation 

  

 

strategy or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

•   quarterly variations in our operating results and the operating results of other technology companies

•   actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors

•   changes in analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or buysell recommendations

•   changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance

•   general conditions in the semiconductor industry and

•   worldwide economic and financial conditions

  

in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors may harm the market price of our common stock 

  










 item 2   properties

  

at march 31 2004 we owned the facilities described below 

  

   

1   on april 7 2003 we announced that we would close fab 1 on our chandler campus and integrate certain of the personnel and processes from fab 1 into fab 2

2   currently classified as an asset heldforsale we have retained a thirdparty broker who is actively marketing fab 3 on our behalf see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – special charges –fab 3 impairment charge” below at page 33 for a discussion of the status of fab 3

3   acquired in august 2002 product and customer qualifications continue production commenced on october 31 2003

4   located in the alphatechnopolis industrial park near bangkok on land to which we expect to acquire title in accordance with our agreement with the landowner progress towards obtaining full title of the land has been delayed due to a complex financial restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land at this time it is not possible to estimate when or if full title transfer will be completed we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land

5   includes an additional 67000 square feet of test and incremental assembly capacity on which construction started during fiscal 2003 and was completed in april 2004

  

at the end of fiscal 2004 we owned longlived assets in the united states amounting to 6204 million and 1178 million in other countries including 1118 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2003 we owned longlived assets in the united states amounting to 7156 million and 1035 million in other countries including 964 million in thailand 

  

 

in addition to the facilities we own we lease several research and development facilities and sales offices in north america europe and asia our aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately 03 million 

  

we currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet our requirements for the next 12 months 

  

as conditions in the insurance market have become more difficult over the last two fiscal years our property insurance costs have increased our coverage levels have decreased and our retained risk exposure from uninsured losses has increased we have not made any material change to our operations as a result of the increased costs and reduced coverage availability and cost of coverage have generally fluctuated over time as the insurance industry reacts to various market forces and we will consider modifying our coverage levels in the future based on availability and pricing 

  

the foregoing statements related to the acquisition of title to the land on which the thailand facility is situated the adequacy of existing facilities for the next 12 months and changes in insurance coverage are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others developments in the financial restructuring of the seller of the land where the thailand facility is situated demand for our products fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization competitive pressures on prices political instability and expropriation cost and availability of insurance and other economic conditions see also the factors set forth under “item 1 – business – additional factors that may affect results of operations” beginning at page 11 of this report 

  




 item 3   legal proceedings

  

microchip technology incorporated v us philips corporation et al   district of arizona 01cv2090pgr as previously reported on october 26 2001 we filed an action in federal district court in arizona for declaratory relief against us philips corporation and philips electronics north america corp together “philips” requesting that the court declare among other matters that we do not infringe philips’ us patent nos 4689740 and 5559502 we initiated legal action so that a determination could be made relating to the validity enforceability and alleged infringement of and our license to the philips’ patents in response to our filing the declaratory judgment action in arizona philips filed an action against us in federal district court in new york alleging infringement of the ‘740 patent and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief the arizona court has agreed to retain jurisdiction and the new york case has been transferred to arizona in response to this development on december 16 2002 philips filed a demand for arbitration in amsterdam with the international chamber of commerce icc we submitted to the icc court of arbitration a jurisdictional objection to proceeding with arbitration pending the outcome of the arizona litigation on may 16 2003 the icc declined to address whether arbitration is inappropriate for jurisdictional reasons and instead left the issue as one which can be brought before the icc arbitration panel on june 13 2003 the arizona court granted microchip’s motion to stay the icc arbitration and proceed with the action in arizona philips has filed a motion to appeal the arizona court order staying the icc arbitration on march 2 2004 the motion to appeal was argued by philips’ and the company’s counsel in the us court of appeals for the federal circuit at this time the icc arbitration the appeal of the arizona court order staying arbitration and the arizona declaratory judgment action are all pending we intend to continue to litigate this matter vigorously we currently believe that the outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations however the final outcome of this matter is inherently uncertain and should the outcome be adverse to us we may be required to pay damages and other expenses and may be subjected to injunctive relief the litigation even if resolved in our favor may also result in diversion of management attention and significant legal fees

  

in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them although the outcome of these actions is not presently determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not harm our business litigation relating to the semiconductor industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation in the future

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

  

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our strategy financial performance and revenue sources we use words such as “anticipate” “believe” “plan” “expect” “future” “intend” and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in this item 7 and under “item 1 – business – additional factors that may affect our results of operations” beginning at page 11 above and elsewhere in this form 10k although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forwardlooking statement 

  

 

we begin our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with a summary of microchip’s overall business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the overall direction of our business and products this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning at page 26 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in sections titled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements”   this mda should be read in conjunction with other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 1 business” “item 6 selected financial data” and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

strategy   our goal is to be a worldwide leader in providing specialized semiconductor products for a wide variety of embedded control applications our strategic focus is on embedded control products which include microcontrollers highperformance linear and mixed signal devices power management and thermal management devices and complementary microperipheral products including interface devices serial eeproms and our patented keeloq ® security devices we provide highly costeffective embedded control products that also offer the advantages of small size high performance low voltagepower operation and ease of development enabling timely and costeffective embedded control product integration by our customers 

  

our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication and assembly and test the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry by owning our wafer fabrication facilities and much of our assembly and test operations and by employing proprietary statistical process control techniques we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of the assembly and test profit margin 

  

we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products we believe our processes afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our engineers utilize advanced computeraided design cad tools and software to perform circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently 

  

we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position our current research and development activities focus on the design of new 8bit microcontrollers 16bit digital signal controllers memory and mixedsignal products assps new development systems and software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 

  

we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market many of our field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical seminars in major cities around the world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support 

  

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general   our discussion and analysis of microchip’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment and assets held for sale and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems we record reserves to cover the estimated returns from oem customers which have historically been less than 15 of the sales to these customers to the extent rates of return change our estimates for the reserves necessary to cover such returns would also change our distributors worldwide have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to thirdparty distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the price of our products it allows the distributor to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivable balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue impact from the price protections we also grant certain credits to our thirdparty distributors the credits are granted to the distributors on specially identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide documentation of the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the product and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their customers we changed our revenue recognition policy as it relates to sales to asia regional distributors during fiscal 2003 as described below at page 36 and in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements to conform with our revenue recognition policies for our distribution channels in the americas and europe 

  

inventories 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin firstout fifo method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our reserves for obsolescence we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a 12month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month demand 

  

income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not 

  

 

provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is “more likely than not” that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2004 our gross deferred tax asset was 1260 million 

  

numerous taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would result 

  

the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others results of any audit conducted by the various taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits available from our deferred tax assets current and future tax laws and regulations and taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations 

  

property plant  equipment 

  

property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred at march 31 2004 the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled 6892 million which represents 425 of our total assets this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgments relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30 years on buildings 

  

in april 2003 we announced our intention to close fab 1 and integrate certain fab 1 personnel and processes into fab 2 we completed the integration process during the quarter ended june 30 2003 after which fab 1 ceased to operate as a wafer fabrication facility the closure of fab 1 and the integration of certain fab 1 personnel into fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of 207 employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we incurred accelerated depreciation charges on the underlying assets and other expenses related to the shut down of fab 1 of approximately 306 million based upon a change in the estimated life and recoverable value of the equipment used at fab 1 that changed based upon our decision to cease fabrication operations at this plant 

  

we began production activities at fab 4 on october 31 2003 we began to depreciate the fab 4 assets as the assets were placed in service for production purposes as of march 31 2004 all of the buildings and supporting facilities were being depreciated as well as the manufacturing equipment that had been placed in service all manufacturing equipment that was not being used in production activities was maintained in projects in process and is not being depreciated until it is placed into service since management believes there is no change to its utility from the present time until it is placed into productive service the lives to be used for depreciating this equipment at fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or carrying values of the underlying assets 

  

the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

  

we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility resides the land is subject to a complex restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land however timing of the resolution is difficult to predict and the ultimate amount to be paid could change 

  

 

impairment of property plant and equipment and assets held for sale 

  

we assess whether indicators of impairment of longlived assets are present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value if less we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other methods if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset we may incur impairment losses or additional losses on already impaired assets in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 

  

litigation 

  

our current estimated range of liability related to certain pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss recorded reserves were not significant at march 31 2004 

  

because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated 

  

   

net sales   

we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of market segments perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 

  

our net sales of 6993 million in fiscal 2004 increased by 478 million or 73 over fiscal 2003 and net sales of 6515 million in fiscal 2003 increased by 802 million or 140 over fiscal 2002 the increases in net sales in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from increased demand predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller products average selling prices for our products were down approximately 9 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 and 4 in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 the number of units of our products sold was up approximately 17 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 and 18 in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 the average selling prices and the unit volumes of our sales are impacted by the mix of our products sold we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years key factors in achieving the amount of net sales during the last three fiscal years include 

  

 

•   continued market share gains

•   increasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products

•   our new product offerings that have increased our served available market and

•   increasing demand for our products

  

we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems under our shipping terms legal title passes to the customer upon shipment from microchip we have no post shipment obligations distributors worldwide generally have broad rights to return products and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributors sell the product to their customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors are included in accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributors to their customers 

  

during the quarter ended december 31 2003 we changed our accounting policy relating to amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs to be consistent with eitf 0010 with this change we have reclassified amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs from a reduction of cost of sales to revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 this reclassification had no impact on net income and an immaterial impact on revenues and cost of sales prior year amounts have not been reclassified as these amounts were immaterial 

  

sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period amounts to the current period presentation 

  

microcontrollers 

  

our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 796 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 approximately 793 of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 and approximately 776 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002 

  

net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 8 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and increased approximately 17 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the increases in net sales were primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets driven principally by market share gains and those factors described above under “ net sales ” at page 26 the end markets that we serve include the automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control markets 

  

historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to in the past and expect to be able to in the future moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features at higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results 

  

 

memory products 

  

sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 131 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 approximately 134 of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 and approximately 150 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002 

  

net sales of our memory products increased approximately 5 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and increased approximately 2 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales 

  

serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle during the past three fiscal years we have experienced several serial eeprom product pricing trends due to market conditions we experienced significant competitive downward pricing pressures in our serial eeprom product lines during the first half of fiscal 2002 returning to modest pricing declines in the second half of fiscal 2002 we experienced modest pricing declines in our serial eeprom product lines during fiscal 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 pricing for our serial eeprom product lines were approximately flat we have experienced and expect to continue to experience varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results 

  

analog and interface products 

  

sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 73 of our total net sales in fiscal 2004 approximately 73 of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 and approximately 74 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002 

  

net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 6 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and increased approximately 13 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in net sales of our analog and interface products in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was driven primarily by new proprietary design wins supply and demand conditions within the market and our ability to gain market share our net sales of analog and interface products within the telecommunications sector primarily in the cell phone market were down approximately 31 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2004 telecommunications represented approximately 16 of our sales of analog and interface products compared to approximately 27 in fiscal 2003 and 32 in fiscal 2002 our net sales of nontelecommunications analog and interface products were up approximately 31 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and up approximately 32 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

  

analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in nature currently we consider more than half of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products during fiscal 2004 our pricing of our nonproprietary analog and interface products moderately increased compared to fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2003 pricing of our nonproprietary analog and interface products was approximately flat compared to fiscal 2002 we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products to increase over time 

  

turns orders 

  

our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the revenue target that we set entering the quarter we have emphasized our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing orders with short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our backlog visibility on future product shipments turns orders correlate to product lead times which have extended during the december 2003 and march 2004 quarters for many of our products with current lead times extending from their levels of the past several years for many of our products customers are beginning to place orders with us extending beyond their immediate requirements 

  

 

the percentage of turns orders in any given quarter is dependent on overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times as such our percentage of turns orders required in any particular quarter has fluctuated significantly over time during fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 our turns orders were at the high end of what we have experienced however as product lead times began to extend during the last two quarters of fiscal 2004 we began to have improved visibility and a reduction in the percentage of turns orders required 

  

even with improved visibility turns orders are difficult to predict and we may not experience the combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in a quarter that would be sufficient to achieve anticipated net sales if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter our net sales and operating results will suffer 

  

the foregoing statements regarding competitive pricing pressure in our microcontroller serial eeprom and analog and interface product lines our ability to moderate future average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines and the proprietary portion of our analog and interface product lines increasing over time are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual orders and sales inventory mix and timing of customer orders customers’ inventory levels order patterns and seasonality level of sellthrough of our products through distribution in any particular fiscal period our ability to ramp products into volume production competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability disruptions in commercial activities or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers the financial condition of our customers fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization changes in product mix absorption of fixed costs labor and other fixed manufacturing costs and general industry economic and political conditions 

  

distribution 

  

distributors accounted for 64 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 60 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and 62 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 

  

our largest distributor accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 12 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 and 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 our two largest distributors accounted for 25 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 

  

generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and we or our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 

  

at march 31 2004 distributors were maintaining an average of approximately 24 months of inventory of our products over the past three fiscal years the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 20 and 31 months thus inventory levels at our distributors are at the low to moderate end of the range we have experienced over the last three years with conditions in the semiconductor industry moving to extending of current lead times we would expect distributors to increase current inventory levels as we recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will materially impact our net sales 

  

distributors generally have broadbased rights to return product to us as revenue on distributor shipments is not recognized until the distributors sell our product on to their end customers distributor returns have no impact on revenue recognition 

  

we also grant certain credits to our thirdparty distributors and also offer these distributors price protection the credits are granted to the distributors on specifically identified pieces of the distributors’ business to allow them to earn a competitive gross margin on the sale of our products to their end customers the credits are on a per unit basis and are not given to the distributor until they provide information regarding the sale to their end customer the effect of granting these credits establishes the net selling price from us to our distributors for the products and results in the net revenue recognized by us when the product is sold by the distributors to their end customers 

  

 

we reduce product pricing through price protection based on market conditions competitive considerations and other factors price protection is granted to thirdparty distributors on the inventory that they have on hand at the date the price protection is offered when we reduce the selling price of our products it allows the distributors to claim a credit against its outstanding accounts receivables balances based on the new price of the inventory it has on hand as of the date of the price reduction there is no revenue recognition impact from the price protections 

  

we do not offer material incentive programs to our thirdparty distributors 

  

the foregoing statements regarding our expectation that distributors will increase their current inventory levels and our belief that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will not materially impact our net sales are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others the rate of recovery in the overall economy and the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual orders and sales inventory mix and timing of customer orders customers’ inventory levels order patterns and seasonality the impact on our business and customer order patterns due to major public health concerns such as the sars virus level of sellthrough of our products through distribution in any particular fiscal period disruptions in commercial activities or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers and the financial condition of our customers 

  

sales by geography 

  

sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were as follows dollars in thousands 

  

   

our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america and south america sales to customers in asia have increased during the last three fiscal years due to lower manufacturing costs and developing markets in asia particularly china 

  

sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 71 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and approximately 69 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 the majority of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 

  

sales to customers in china including hong kong accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2004 and approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the periods covered by this report 

  

gross profit   our gross profit was 3500 million in fiscal 2004 3522 million in fiscal 2003 and 2867 million in fiscal 2002 gross profit as a percent of sales was 500 in fiscal 2004 541 in fiscal 2003 and 502 in fiscal 2002   the most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage over the past three fiscal years were 

  

•   improvements in capacity utilization and product absorption which positively affected gross margin by 104 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and by 271 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002

  

 

•   318 million in accelerated depreciation and other costs associated with the closure of fab 1 which negatively affected gross margin in fiscal 2004

•   increases in noncapitalized expenses in fab 3 and fab 4 our nonoperational facilities for portions of the periods covered by this report which negatively affected gross margin noncapitalized expenses amounted to 181 million in fiscal 2004 131 million in fiscal 2003 and 64 million in fiscal 2002

•   a oneweek unpaid shutdown negatively affecting gross profit by 17 million in fiscal 2004 the shutdown occurred in the three months ended september 30 2003 and had a negative impact on gross profit due to the fact that certain fixed costs including depreciation utilities property taxes and other ongoing costs continued when the factory was shut down there were no shutdowns in fiscal 2003 there were three shutdowns in fiscal 2002 that negatively affected gross profit by a total of 50 million two of the fiscal 2002 shutdowns were unpaid which lessened the unfavorable impact on gross profit

  

other factors that impacted gross profit percentage in the periods covered by this report include 

  

•   continued cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing such as new manufacturing technologies and more efficient manufacturing techniques

•   varying factors impacting the average selling prices of our products

•   fluctuations in the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and analog products and related serial eeprom products and

•   inventory writeoffs and the sale of inventory that was previously written off

  

during fiscal 2002 we operated at approximately 70 of our cumulative total fab 1 and fab 2 capacity due to capacity reductions implemented in the march 2001 quarter and oneweek plant shutdowns in each quarter of fiscal 2002 our overall gross margins in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by these actions due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in our wafer fabrication manufacturing during fiscal 2003 we operated at approximately 85 of our cumulative total fab 1 and fab 2 capacity which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2004 we operated at approximately 91 of our fab 2 capacity which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal 2003 we are in the early stages of ramping our production activities at fab 4 

  

the process technologies utilized impact our gross margins fab 2 currently utilizes various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilizes our 05 to 10 micron processes fab 4 currently utilizes our 05 micron process technology we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs since the closure of fab 1 in june 2003 all of our production has been on 8inch wafers in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 approximately 80 of our production was on 8inch wafers 

  

our overall inventory levels were 945 million at march 31 2004 compared to 1023 million at march 31 2003 and 886 million at march 31 2002 we had 101 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2004 compared to 128 days at march 31 2003 and 110 days at march 31 2002 

  

we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption wafer fab loading levels and competitive and economic conditions 

  

the foregoing statements relating to our transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs and the fluctuation of gross margins over time are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization changes in capacity utilization absorption of fixed costs labor and other direct manufacturing costs competition and competitive pressure on pricing disruptions in commercial activities or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability our ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed cost and availability of raw materials changes in product mix and other general industry economic and political conditions 

  

 

at march 31 2004 approximately 71 of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 77 as of march 31 2003 and approximately 53 at march 31 2002 thirdparty contractors located throughout asia perform the balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements were being performed in our thailand facility over the last three fiscal years as of april 30 2004 we had substantially completed a 67000 square foot expansion area at our thailand facility that once placed in service will increase the facility’s test capacity by approximately 80 the expansion area is expected to be placed in service in fiscal 2005 we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to thirdparty contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 

  

our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 

  

research and development rd 

  

rd expenses for fiscal 2004 were 854 million or 122 of sales compared to 88 million or 135 of sales for fiscal 2003 and 817 million or 143 of sales for fiscal 2002 we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position we expense all rd costs as incurred rd expenses include expenditures for labor depreciation masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and software to support new products and design environments 

  

rd expenses decreased 26 million or 30 for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 the primary reasons for the dollar decrease in rd costs in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 were reductions in professional services and lower costs associated with product prototyping which were partially offset by increases in labor costs   rd expenses increased 63 million or 77 for fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 the primary reason for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was increased labor and professional service costs associated with expanding our technical resources and the ongoing rd expenses acquired as part of the acquisition of powersmart inc described at “ special charges – fiscal 2003 – powersmart inprocess research and development charge ” below at page 34 rd expenses would have been higher in fiscal 2002 if we had not implemented unpaid oneweek shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2002 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2004 were 924 million or 132 of sales compared to 894 million or 137 of sales for fiscal 2003 and 826 million or 145 of sales for fiscal 2002 selling general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 31 million or 34 for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 were increases in labor costs and travel expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 67 million or 82 for fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 the primary reason for the dollar increase in selling general and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 relate to increased labor costs due to increases in headcount salaries and bonuses 

  

selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels 

  

special charges   the following table presents a summary of special charges for the fiscal years ended march 31 2004 and 2003 there were no special charges incurred during fiscal 2002 

  

 

 

  

fiscal 2004 

  

fab 1 closure and special charges 

  

on april 7 2003 we announced our intention to close our chandler arizona fab 1 wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain fab 1 personnel and processes into our tempe arizona fab 2 wafer fabrication facility we completed this integration process during the threemonth period ended june 30 2003 the closure of fab 1 and the integration of certain fab 1 personnel into fab 2 operations resulted in a reduction in force of 207 employees who were either directly involved in our manufacturing operations or provided support to fab 1 the detail of the charges incurred related to the closure of fab 1 that were included in cost of sales for the threemonth period ended june 30 2003 is as follows amounts in thousands 

  

 

  

for the quarter ended june 30 2003 operating expense included 1612000 of special charges recorded principally for contract cancellation severance and other costs related to the closure of fab 1 and other actions we incurred 865000 of such expenditures during fiscal 2004 we reversed 747000 of the special charges recorded in the quarter ended june 30 2003 in the quarter ended december 31 2003 as a result of a favorable outcome in the settlement of a contract cancellation 

  

the facility where fab 1 is located is an integral part of our overall campus in chandler arizona within this same facility resides our wafer probe mask making and other manufacturing related activities the accelerated depreciation that was taken only related to assets used in the wafer fabrication operations at the facility we have no specific plans for utilizing the space formerly housing the wafer fabrication operations and intend to leave it in an idle status the property plant and equipment that was subject to the accelerated depreciation is reflected in the gross and accumulated depreciation carrying values in the property plant and equipment section of our balance sheet and related footnote disclosures 

  

fiscal 2003 

  

fab 3 impairment charge 

  

in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “sfas 144” “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” which is applicable to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 sfas 144 provides a single accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that must be met to classify an asset as heldforsale classification as heldforsale is an important distinction because assets heldforsale are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell sfas 144 is effective for all of our financial statements issued subsequent to april 1 2002 in accordance with sfas 144 we recorded a 415 million asset impairment charge during the quarter ended september 30 2002 as described below 

  

 

we acquired fab 3 a semiconductor manufacturing facility in puyallup washington in july 2000 the original purchase consisted of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real property it was our intention to bring fab 3 to productive readiness and commence volume production of 8inch wafers using our 07 and 05 micron process technologies by august 2001 we delayed our production start up at fab 3 due to deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal 2002 fab 3 has never been brought to productive readiness 

  

on august 23 2002 we acquired fab 4 a semiconductor manufacturing facility in gresham oregon see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements on page f10 below we decided to purchase fab 4 instead of bringing fab 3 to productive readiness because among other things the cost of the manufacturing equipment needed to ramp production at fab 3 over the next several years was significantly higher than the total purchase price of fab 4 and the time to bring fab 4 to productive readiness was significantly less than the time required to bring fab 3 to productive readiness 

  

after the acquisition of fab 4 was completed we undertook an analysis of the potential production capacity at fab 4 the results of the production capacity analysis led us to determine that fab 3’s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the september 2002 quarter we committed to a plan to sell fab 3 we have retained a thirdparty broker to market fab 3 on our behalf accordingly fab 3 was classified as an asset heldforsale as of september 30 2002 and maintained that classification at march 31 2004 given management’s continued intent to sell the facility within the next twelve months 

  

management determined the value assigned to the assets through various methods including assistance from a thirdparty appraisal the independent third party used the market approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair value of fab 3 the comparable sales included eight properties including our purchases of fab 3 in july 2000 and fab 4 in august 2002 based on the results of this appraisal we recorded an asset impairment charge on fab 3 of 369 million including estimated costs to sell the remaining value of 602 million is classified as an asset heldforsale and is included as a component of other current assets at march 31 2004 

  

during the quarter ended september 30 2002 we also recorded an asset impairment charge of 46 million to writedown certain excess manufacturing equipment located at fab 3 to its net realizable value of 02 million this manufacturing equipment became “excess” as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of fab 4 the net realizable value for the excess manufacturing equipment was determined based on management estimates substantially all of the other manufacturing equipment located at fab 3 has been transferred to and will be used in our other wafer fabrication facilities located in tempe arizona fab 2 and gresham oregon fab 4 

  

if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated in the appraisal or if future market conditions deteriorate the net proceeds from the assets heldforsale could be less than the amount estimated in the financial statements and additional charges could result prior to or at the time of the sale of fab 3 however as of march 31 2004 management did not believe that fab 3 was recorded in excess of its recoverable value based on an assessment of existing market conditions 

  

powersmart inprocess research and development charge 

  

during the quarter ended june 30 2002 purchased inprocess research and development of 93 million associated with our acquisition of powersmart inc was written off at the date of the acquisition june 5 2002 in accordance with fasb interpretation no 4 “ applicability of fasb statement no 2 business combinations accounted for by the purchase method” fin 4 powersmart delivered a battery management whole product solution that improves system runtimes with a lower system cost for the user included in the whole product solution is an application tools suite designed to speed up implementation during the user’s development and production the acquisition was intended to strengthen our position in battery management applications such as laptop computers personal digital assistants cellular telephones digital cameras and camcorders 

  

the assets acquired included inprocess research and development for which there is no alternative future uses management determined the value assigned to this asset through various methods including assistance from third party appraisal firms in valuing the powersmart business as of the valuation date there were 15 projects that were considered to be in process the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the inprocess projects these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating expenses cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the inprocess technology these net returns were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving commercial readiness the 

  

 

above analysis resulted in 93 million of value assigned to acquired inprocess research and development which was expensed on the acquisition date in accordance with fasb interpretation no 4 “applicability of fasb statement no 2 business combinations accounted for by the purchase method” we believe the assumptions used in valuing inprocess research and development are reasonable but are inherently uncertain since the date of the purchase we incurred development costs of approximately 41 million related to the acquired inprocess research and development and should the projects continue to move toward commercialization we estimate that future expenditures could approximate 06 million over the next fiscal year as of march 31 2004 four of the inprocess research and development projects had been completed six had been postponed and five projects continue to be inprocess we expect the six inprocess projects to be completed in fiscal 2005 or before 

  

the foregoing statements relating to our estimated future expenditures on the acquired inprocess rd projects and expected completion dates for rd projects are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others delays in completion of a particular project changes in our prioritization of projects changes in the specifications of a particular project unforeseen engineering problems and unanticipated costs 

  

other income expense 

  

interest income in fiscal 2004 increased from interest income in fiscal 2003 as our average invested cash balances were at higher levels in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 interest income in fiscal 2003 decreased from interest income in fiscal 2002 as our average invested cash balances and the interest rates applicable to our invested cash balances were lower in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provisions for income taxes reflect tax on our foreign earnings and federal and state tax on our us earnings our effective tax rate was 228 in fiscal 2004 223 in fiscal 2003 and 255 in fiscal 2002 and is lower than statutory rates in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations and rd tax credits the decreases in our effective tax rates in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 were due to the impairment portion of the special charges in fiscal 2003 and the accelerated depreciation and other charges associated with the closure of fab 1 in fiscal 2004 which provided an income tax benefit at a greater rate than our historic effective rate given the 40 tax jurisdiction in which the charges occurred these charges impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 by approximately 270 basis points and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 by approximately 300 basis points 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at march 31 2004 our gross deferred tax asset was 1260 million 

  

various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations we are currently under audit by the united states internal revenue service for our fiscal years ended march 31 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in the united states and other countries in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 

  

 

our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property plant and equipment in thailand although our tax holidays in thailand partially expired in october 2003 our manufacturing operations in thailand are being predominantly conducted using equipment that was invested pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until september 2006 the expiration of a portion of our tax holiday in thailand did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal 2004 

  

the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset from our future taxable income and the adequacy of our tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others current and future tax laws and regulations taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations results of any current or future audit conducted by the us internal revenue service or other taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business and the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax asset 

  

change in accounting principle 

  

we had historically recognized revenue from sales to our americas european and multinational asian distributors at point of sale pos or when those distributors sell our products to their customers and prior to fiscal 2003 we recognized revenue on sales to regional asian distributors at point of purchase pop or when we shipped product to these distributors upon shipment amounts billed to distributors at pos are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to its customers 

  

on march 18 2003 we announced that we would change our revenue recognition policy relating to regional asian distributors from pop to pos we believe that revenue recognition at pos for sales to distributors as our sole revenue recognition policy worldwide is a more reflective measure of end customer demand for our products to implement the change in revenue recognition we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 114 million net of income taxes of 66 million as of april 1 2002 the beginning of fiscal 2003 the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was calculated by multiplying the quantity of our inventory that the regional asia distributors maintained as of april 1 2002 by the gross margin we would realize on those sales net of related income tax we restated our quarterly results for fiscal 2003 to conform to the change in accounting principle and have included the restated amounts at note 23 of our consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we had 4745 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at march 31 2004 an increase of 2580 million from the march 31 2003 balance the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments over this time period is primarily attributable to our cash flows generated from operations 

  

during fiscal 2004 we maintained an unsecured shortterm line of credit with various financial institutions in asia which at march 31 2004 totaled 5 million us dollar equivalent there were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march 31 2004 but an allocation of approximately 06 million of the available line was made relating to import guarantees associated with our business in thailand there are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit 

  

net cash provided from operating activities was 3431 million for fiscal 2004 2602 million for fiscal 2003 and 1788 million for fiscal 2002 the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to our results of operations after consideration of noncash special charges increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and decreases in inventory 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 2676 million for fiscal 2004 3768 million for fiscal 2003 and 1387 million in fiscal 2002 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the purchases of fab 4 and powersmart that occurred in fiscal 2003 

  

we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future there were no hedges outstanding as of march 31 2004 

  

 

our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 635 million in fiscal 2004 2651 million in fiscal 2003 and 447 million in fiscal 2002 the primary reason for the dollar decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was a reduced need for additional capital equipment as a result of our purchase of fab 4 during fiscal 2003 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 were the purchase of fab 4 other selective investments to increase our manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and our continued investment in rd equipment we currently intend to spend approximately 75 million during the next 12 months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

we expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 241 million for fiscal 2004 and 31 million for fiscal 2003 net cash provided by financing activities was 161 million in fiscal 2002 proceeds from the sale of stock the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were 532 million for fiscal 2004 315 million for fiscal 2003 and 438 million for fiscal 2002 cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 539 million in fiscal 2004 265 million in fiscal 2003 and 278 million in fiscal 2002 

  

on august 7 2002 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2004 we had repurchased the entire 2500000 common share authorization for a total of 593 million on march 11 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of march 31 2004 we had repurchased 1200100 common shares under this authorization for a total of 312 million as of march 31 2004 all but 1967508 of the purchased shares under both authorizations had been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations on april 22 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 

  

on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount of 40 million we have continued to pay quarterly dividends and have increased the amount of such dividends on a regular basis during fiscal 2004 we paid dividends in the amount of 0113 per share for a total dividend payment of 233 million 

  

we maintained a net shares settled forward contract during the year ended march 31 2002 during fiscal 2002 we made a net delivery of 572645 shares of our common stock we also received approximately 141 million in connection with an early termination covering 1650000 of the shares outstanding under the net shares settled forward contract we closed out the net shares settled forward contract in its entirety on january 15 2002 and made a cash payment of 278 million to purchase the remaining 1610606 shares outstanding under the contract the purchased shares were held as treasury shares and were used to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan through april 9 2002 

  

we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities or for other purposes the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix and competitive factors there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

  

the foregoing statements regarding our anticipated level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months the nature of such expenditures the financing and sufficiency of our capital expenditures and our belief that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our requirements are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among others changes in demand for our products and those of our customers changes in utilization of current manufacturing capacity unanticipated costs in continuing to ramp production at fab 4our ability to increase 

  

 

production at fab 2 market acceptance of our products and of our customers’ products the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products the availability and cost of raw materials equipment and other supplies actual levels of capital expenditures the costs and outcome of any litigation involving intellectual property customer or other issues the financial condition of our customers and vendors uninsured losses and the economic political and other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march 31 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at march 31 2004 dollars in thousands 

  

   

1   capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchase or property plant and equipment they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of march 31 2004 as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 

  

2   other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses 

  

3   total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 

  

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purpose of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on microchip and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not have any transactions arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provided offbalance sheet financing liquidity or market or credit risk support engage in leasing hedging research and development services or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements see note 18 of the financial statements regarding our lease commitments 

  

 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities “vies” either 1 that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or 2 in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest in december 2003 the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin 46 “revised interpretations” resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie vies created after january 31 2003 but prior to january 1 2004 may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations for vies created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december 15 2003 certain disclosures are effective immediately vies created after january 1 2004 must be accounted for under the revised interpretations we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin no 46 did not have an effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in april 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” which is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 sfas no 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in sfas no 133 clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component amends the definition of an “underlying” to conform it to the language used in fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” and amends certain other existing pronouncements we do not have any derivative financial instruments the adoption of sfas no 149 did not have any impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations shareholders’ equity and cash flows 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” this statement requires that certain instruments that were previously classified as equity on a company’s statement of financial position now be classified as liabilities the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june 15 2003 we have no instruments impacted by the adoption of this statement and therefore the adoption of sfas no 150 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

  

our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an availableforsale basis was 4629 million as of march 31 2004 and 2087 million as of march 31 2003 these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase the following table provides information about our availableforsale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates we have aggregated our availableforsale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollars in thousands 

  

   

we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant approximately 99 of our sales are denominated in us dollars at times we maintain hedges of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation the amounts of the hedges outstanding as of march 31 2004 and march 31 2003 were immaterial if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates at march 31 2004 and march 31 2003 the effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be material 

  

 

during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discuss in this item 7a and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future

     in addition embedded control systems facilitate the emergence of complete
new classes of products embedded control systems have been incorporated into
thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of markets worldwide
including

     o    automotive comfort safety and     o    cordless and cellular
          entertainment applications              telephone accessories
     o    remote control devices             o    motor controls
     o    handheld tools                     o    security systems
     o    home appliances                    o    educational and entertainment

                                                  pda accessories

     embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the
principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a
selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit
nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various
inputoutput peripheral capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a
complete embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and
may include specialized peripheral device controllers and internal or external
nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms to store additional program
software

     the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for
microcontrollers one of the largest segments of the semiconductor market
microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures
although 4bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive they generally lack
the minimum performance and features required for product differentiation and
are typically used only to produce basic functionality in products while
traditional 16 and 32bit architectures provide very high performance they are
generally more expensive for most highvolume embedded control applications
typically costing two to four times the cost of an 8bit microcontroller as a
result manufacturers of competitive highvolume products have increasingly
found 8bit microcontrollers to be the most costeffective embedded control
solution

     most microcontrollers available today are rombased and must be programmed
by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing resulting in 10 to 12week
lead times based on current market conditions for delivery of such
microcontrollers in addition to delayed product introduction these long lead
times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory
shutdowns when changes in the firmware are required to address these issues
some suppliers offer programmable microcontrollers that can be configured by the
customer in the customers manufacturing line thus minimizing leadtime and
inventory risks when the inevitable firmware changes occur while these
microcontrollers were initially expensive relative to rombased
microcontrollers manufacturing technology has evolved over the last several
years to the point where reprogrammable microcontrollers are now available for
little to no premium over rombased microcontrollers thus providing significant
value to microcontroller customers as a result reprogrammable microcontrollers
are the fastest growing segment of the 8bit microcontroller market

     wafer fabrication

     as we announced on april 7 2003 we are closing fab 1 and integrating
certain personnel and processes from fab 1 into fab 2 fab 1 which currently
produces 6inch wafers using manufacturing processes between 05 and 50
microns is our oldest manufacturing facility fab 2 currently produces 8inch
wafers and supports manufacturing processes between 035 and 50 microns

     we expect that the integration of fab 1 processes and products into fab 2
will be completed by june 30 2003 at which time fab 1 will cease to operate as
a wafer fabrication facility we also expect that we will incur accelerated
depreciation charges and other expenses related to the shut down of fab 1 in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004 see item 7  managements discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations  recent development below at
page 24 for a discussion of these anticipated charges

     we believe the combined capacity of fab 2 and fab 4 will provide sufficient
capacity to allow us to respond to increases in future demand

     during fiscal 2003 fabs 1 and 2 operated at approximately 85 of their
aggregate capacity compared to approximately 70 of their aggregate capacity
during fiscal 2002 operating at lower percentages of capacity has a negative
impact on operating results due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in
our wafer fabrication manufacturing as of march 31 2003 products manufactured
on 8inch wafers accounted for approximately 80 of our production

     fab 3 is nonoperational and is currently classified as an asset
heldforsale see item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations  special charges  fab 3 impairment
charge below at page 33 for a discussion of the status of fab 3

     fab 4 was acquired in august 2002 product and customer qualifications are
in process and production startup is currently planned for the third quarter of
fiscal 2004 fab 4 will produce 8inch wafers using 05 micron manufacturing
processes however fab 4 is capable of supporting technologies below 018
microns

     we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to
reduce future manufacturing costs we believe that our successful transition to
more advanced process technologies and larger wafers is important for us to
remain competitive our future operating results could be adversely affected if
any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented

     we also contract with thirdparty wafer foundries to fabricate
approximately 3 of our products primarily in our analog and smart battery
management product families we plan to transition certain of these products to
our own wafer fabrication facilities over time on a strategic basis we will
continue to use thirdparty foundries to shorten our product design cycle on
certain key technologies and products

     assembly and test

     we perform product assembly and testing at our facilities located near
bangkok thailand at march 31 2003 approximately 77 of our assembly
requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31
2003 our thailand facility was testing substantially all of our wafer
production during fiscal 2003 we substantially completed an approximately
67000 square foot expansion of test capacity at our thailand facility that
once placed in service will increase the facilitys test capacity by between
50 and 70 the expansion was not finalized as the capacity is not currently
required due to conditions within the semiconductor industry we plan to
complete the expansion when business conditions indicate that the capacity is
required we also use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in several asian
countries for the balance of our assembly and test requirements

     general matters impacting our manufacturing operations

     we employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our
microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes afford us both
costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and greater
functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors develop and
optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines we use a
common process technology for both microcontroller and nonvolatile memory
products this allows us to more fully absorb our process research and
development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly our

                                       6
page
engineers utilize advanced cad tools and software to perform circuit design
simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer fabrication
facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test
wafers quickly and efficiently

     due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing
consistently high manufacturing yields can have significant positive effects on
gross profit and overall operating results during fiscal 2003 our focus on
manufacturing productivity allowed us to maintain average wafer fab line yields
in excess of 95 our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a
comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee
training and selective upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment
maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in
the achievement of our operating results the manufacture and assembly of
integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic
devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes
are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants
in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the
performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in
the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than
anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are
unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels

     our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and
equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one
source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers
capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our
standards in addition the raw materials and equipment necessary for our
business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of
semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply
shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told
us they need more time than expected to fill our orders an interruption of any
raw materials or equipment sources could harm our business

     our reliance on third parties for a portion of wafer fabrication and
assembly and testing involves some reduction in our level of control over the
portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the quality
delivery and cost performance of these thirdparty contractors our future
operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to
maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at
approximately their current levels

     the foregoing statements related to the timing of the completion of the
transfer of processes and products from fab 1 to fab 2 the timing composition
and amount of any charges related to the shutdown of fab 1 the timing of
production startup of fab 4 the shutdown of fab 1 and the integration of
certain personnel and processes from fab 1 into fab 2 and the startup of fab 4
allowing us to reduce future manufacturing costs the combined capacity of fab 2
and fab 4 providing sufficient capacity to allow us to respond to future
increases in demand and the transition to more advanced process technologies to
reduce future manufacturing costs are forwardlooking statements actual results
could differ materially because of the following factors among others our
ability to effectively carry out our planned restructuring activities and
realize the savings and operational efficiencies expected from these actions
the rate of recovery in the overall economy and the uncertainty of current
economic and political conditions the potential for unanticipated results from
our restructuring activities on our performance including customer concerns
productivity and the retention of key employees changes in utilization of our
current manufacturing capacity unanticipated costs in bringing fab 4 online
timely facilitization of fab 4 including the availability of equipment and
other supplies our ability to ramp products into volume production at fab 4
the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the portland oregon
area changes in demand for products and the products of our customers changes
in demand for our analog and battery management products supply disruption
absorption of fixed costs labor and other direct manufacturing costs
fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity
utilization changes in product mix competitive pressures on prices labor
unrest political instability and expropriation and other general economic
conditions

research and development rd

     we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products
including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process
technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in
maintaining our competitive position our current rd activities focus on the
design of new 8bit microcontrollers 16bit digital signal controllers memory
and mixedsignal products assps new development systems and software and
applicationspecific software libraries we are also developing new design and
process technology to achieve further cost reductions and performance
improvements in existing products

sales and distribution

     general

     we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct
sales personnel and distributors

     our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in
three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain
sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe
and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to
the continued development of the embedded control market the majority of our
field sales engineers fses field application engineers faes and sales
management have technical degrees and have been previously employed in an
engineering environment we believe that the technical knowledge of our sales
force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products the primary
mission of our fae team is to provide technical assistance to strategic accounts
and to conduct periodic training sessions for fses and distributor sales teams
faes also frequently conduct technical seminars in major cities around the
world and work closely with our distributors to provide technical assistance
and enduser support

     distribution

     our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical
support requirements of a broad base of diverse customers we believe that
distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse
customer base

     in fiscal 2003 we derived 60 of our net sales from sales through
distributors and 40 of our net sales from direct sales to original equipment
manufacturers referred to as oem customers distributors accounted for 62 of
our net sales in fiscal 2002 and 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2001 one
distributor accounted for 12 of our total net sales for fiscal 2003 13 of our
total net sales for fiscal 2002 and 14 for fiscal 2001 no other distributor or
end customer accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal years 2003
2002 or 2001

     generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and
our distributors may terminate their relationship with us with little or no
advanced notice the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more
of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and
could result in us receiving product returns from the distributors

     as is common in the semiconductor industry we provide price protection to
our distributors under our current policy distributors receive a credit for
the difference at the time of a price reduction between the price they were
originally charged for products in inventory and the reduced price that we
subsequently charge distributors on a casebycase basis distributors may also
receive credit for specific transactions that we approve in advance we also
grant distributors limited rights to return products

     revenue recognition

     we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems for sales
recorded upon shipment we record reserves to cover the estimated customer
returns our distributors have broad rights to return products and price
protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells
the product to their customers upon shipment amounts billed to distributors
are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred
and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is
sold by the distributor to their customers we changed our revenue recognition
policy as it relates to sales to asia regional distributors during fiscal 2003

     our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe
which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive
communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas
sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america
and south america

     sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 71 of our net sales
in fiscal 2003 approximately 69 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 and
approximately 68 of our net sales in fiscal 2001

     sales to customers in china accounted for approximately 13 of our net
sales in fiscal 2003 we did not have sales into any other foreign countries
that exceeded 10 of our net sales during the periods covered by this report

     our international sales are predominately billed in us dollars although
foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not
experienced any material difficulties as a result of export restrictions to
date

     our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks as described under
the heading we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which
exposes us to foreign political and economic risks on page 16

backlog

     as of april 25 2003 our backlog was approximately 1066 million
compared to 1199 million as of april 26 2002 our backlog includes all
purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months

     we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory
within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large
extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by
shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current
backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the
customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for
scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable
measure of sales for any future period

competition

     the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been
characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with
major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have
greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing
distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering
manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products emerging companies
may also increase their participation in the market for embedded control
applications furthermore capacity in the semiconductor industry is generally
increasing over time and such increased capacity or improved product
availability could adversely affect our competitive position

                                       9
page
     we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation
and performance of our embedded control products including such products

     o    speed                              o    reliability
     o    functionality                      o    packaging alternatives
     o    density                            o    price and
     o    power consumption                  o    availability

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control
market include

     o    ease of use
     o    functionality of application development systems
     o    dependable delivery and quality and
     o    technical service and support

     we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these
factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could
harm our business

patents licenses and trademarks

     we maintain a portfolio of united states and foreign patents expiring on
various dates between 2003 and 2021 we also have numerous additional united
states and foreign patent applications pending while we intend to continue to
seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes we believe that our
continued success depends primarily on the technological skills and innovative
abilities of our personnel and our ability to rapidly commercialize product
developments rather than on our patents our existing patents and any new
patents that are issued may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide
meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us in addition the laws
of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to
the same extent as the laws of the united states

     we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and
crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and
manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our
customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive
communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual
property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all
such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry
practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or
other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that
licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that
damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could
result in substantial cost to us and divert management effort may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us
against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain
necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement
claims could harm our business see item 3  legal proceedings beginning
below at page 19

environmental regulation

     we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental
regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of certain
chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes our facilities have
been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our
activities are conducted in compliance with such regulations any changes in
such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly
equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental
regulations any failure by us to control adequately the storage use and
disposal of regulated substances could result in future liabilities

     increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of
electronic manufacturing operations while we have not experienced any
materially adverse effects on our operations from environmental regulations our
business and results of operations could suffer if for any reason we fail to
control the use of or to restrict adequately the discharge of hazardous
substances under present or future environmental regulations

employees

     as of april 25 2003 we had 3373 employees approximately 39 of our
employees work at our thailand facility none of our employees in the us or
thailand are represented by a labor organization we have never had a work
stoppage and believe that our employee relations are good

     on april 7 2003 we announced that the closure of fab 1 and the
integration of certain personnel and processes from fab 1 into fab 2 would
result in a reduction in force of approximately 140 employees see item 1 
business  manufacturing above at page 5 for a discussion of the closure of
fab 1 and the integration of certain personnel and processes into fab 2

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce
our net sales and profitability

     our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors
that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our
control some of the factors that may affect our quarterly operating results
include

     o    changes in demand for our products in the distribution and oem
          channels
     o    the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual
          orders and sales
     o    the level of sellthrough of our products through distribution
     o    the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter
          turns orders
     o    market acceptance of both our products and our customers products
     o    customer order patterns and seasonality
     o    levels of inventories at our distributors and other customers
     o    inventory mix and timing of customer orders
     o    downward pricing pressures in our product lines
     o    possible disruption in commercial activities or international
          transport or delivery caused by war armed conflict or terrorist
          activity or unexpected increases in the price of or decrease in the
          supply of oil any of which could result in changes in logistics and
          security arrangements and reduced customer purchases relative to
          expectations
     o    impact of events outside of the united states such as the business
          impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political
          instability
     o    the impact on our business and on customer order patterns due to major
          public health concerns such as the outbreak of the sars virus
     o    disruption in the supply of wafers or assembly and testing services
     o    availability of manufacturing capacity the extent of effective use of
          manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields
     o    the availability and cost of raw materials equipment and other
          supplies
     o    the costs and outcome of any litigation involving intellectual
          property customer and other issues
     o    uninsured losses and
     o    economic political and other conditions in the worldwide markets
          served by us

     we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are
not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such
comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our
operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common
stock

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing
capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields

     the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly
nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we
produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety
of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing
environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer
fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor
industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated
manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to
maintain yields at approximately the current levels

     our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less
than optimal capacity lower capacity utilization results in certain costs being
charged directly to expense and lower gross margins

if we do not bring our fab 4 gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility on
line in a timely manner our anticipated revenues may be reduced and our gross
margins will be adversely impacted

                                       12

     we acquired fab 4 located in gresham oregon in august 2002 we currently
anticipate that fab 4 will commence production in the third quarter of fiscal
2004 bringing fab 4 online involves significant risks including

     o    successful implementation of our 05 micron manufacturing process at
          fab 4
     o    effective integration of a variety of hardware and software components
     o    potential shortages of materials and skilled labor
     o    unforeseen environmental or engineering problems
     o    approvals and requirements of governmental and regulatory agencies
          and
     o    unanticipated costs

     any one of these risks could delay the equipping and production startup of
fab 4 and could involve significant additional costs or reduce our anticipated
revenues

     as a result of these and other factors fab 4 may not commence production
when anticipated or within budget also we may be unable to achieve adequate
manufacturing yields in fab 4 in a timely manner and our revenues may not
increase in proportion to the anticipated increase in manufacturing capacity
associated with fab 4 which would harm our operating results

we depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and
therefore have limited visibility of future product shipments

     our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments
from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter
which we refer to as turns orders we emphasize our ability to respond quickly
to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers
placing orders with short delivery schedules shorter lead times generally mean
that turns orders as a percentage of our business is relatively high in any
particular quarter and reduces our visibility on future product shipments the
percentage of turns orders in any given quarter fluctuates and depends on
overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times

     as such our percentage of turns orders required in any particular quarter
has fluctuated over the last three fiscal years between approximately 20 and
62 because turns orders are difficult to predict increased levels of turns
orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast if we do not achieve a
sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our revenue
targets our revenue and operating results will suffer

intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures
reduced sales of our products and reduced market share

     the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been
characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with
major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have
greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical
marketing distribution and other resources than we with which to pursue
engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products
emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market for
embedded control applications we may be unable to compete successfully in the
future which could harm our business

     our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both
within and outside our control including

     o    the quality performance reliability features ease of use pricing
          and diversity of our products
     o    the quality of our customer service and our ability to address the
          needs of our customers
     o    our success in designing and manufacturing new products including
          those implementing new technologies
     o    the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own
          products
     o    our level of manufacturing capacity utilization and manufacturing
          yields
     o    our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering and management
          personnel
     o    product introductions by our competitors
     o    the number nature and success of our competitors in a given market
     o    our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and other
          supplies at acceptable prices
     o    our ability to protect our products and processes by effective
          utilization of intellectual property laws and general market and
          economic conditions

     historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease
over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of
our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained
relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and
nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time we have
experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure in certain
of our proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we
have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our
proprietary product lines by continuing to introduce new products with more
features and higher prices we have experienced in the past and expect to
continue to experience in the future varying degrees of competitive pricing
pressures in our serial eeprom products

     we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a
result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would reduce our
operating results

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition
for qualified personnel is intense in our market

     our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities
of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for
qualified engineering and management personnel is intense we may be
unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and
retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of
one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could
harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our
senior management team

our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis

     our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our
ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete
effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer
requirements the success of our new product introductions depends on various
factors including

     o    proper new product selection
     o    timely completion and introduction of new product designs
     o    development of support tools and collateral literature that make
          complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and
     o    market acceptance of our customers end products

     because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to
time in completing development of new products in addition our new products
may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to
design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which
could reduce our future operating results

     our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new
design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies
are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd
expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time
experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process
technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or
delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely
affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially
delayed or inefficiently implemented

general conditions in the insurance industry may affect our costs and increase
the risks to our business operations

     as conditions in the insurance industry have resulted in decreased
availability of coverage and substantially increased insurance rates over the
last two fiscal years our liability property and casualty insurance coverage
levels have decreased and our retained risk exposure from uninsured losses has
increased we have not made any material change to our operations as a result of
the reduced coverage availability and cost of insurance coverage have generally
fluctuated over time as the insurance industry reacts to various market forces
and we will continue to consider changes in our coverage levels based on
conditions in the insurance market

                                       14

we are dependent on several thirdparty contractors to perform key manufacturing
functions for us

     we use several thirdparty contractors located throughout asia for a
portion of the assembly and testing of our products we also rely on outside
wafer foundries for a portion of the wafer fabrication of our analog and smart
battery management products through the first half of fiscal 2004 we expect to
continue to rely on one outside foundry to supply a substantial portion of the
wafers that are required to support our smart battery management business which
represented approximately 2 of our net sales during the quarter ended march 31
2003 such foundry is a direct competitor of ours although we have reduced our
dependence on thirdparty contractors over time the disruption or termination
of any of these sources could harm our business and operating results our use
of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the
portions of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could
suffer if any thirdparty contractor were to experience financial operations
production difficulties or situations when demand exceeds capacity or if they
were unable to maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs
at approximately their current levels in such case we may not be able to
qualify additional manufacturing sources for our products on a timely manner or
at all and such arrangements if any may not be on favorable terms to us

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet
our needs

     our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and
equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one
source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers
capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our
standards in addition the raw materials and equipment necessary for our
business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of
semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply
shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told
us they need more time than expected to fill our orders or that they will no
longer support certain equipment with updates or spare and replacements parts
an interruption of any raw materials or equipment sources or the lack of
supplier support for a particular piece of equipment could harm our business

our business is highly dependent on selling through distributors

     sales through distributors accounted for 60 of our net sales for the
fiscal year ended march 31 2003 sales through one distributor accounted for
12 of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended march 31 2003 generally
we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and our distributors
may terminate their relationship with us with little or no advanced notice

     the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our
distributors could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in
an increase in inventory returns

our operating results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of supply and
demand in the semiconductor industry

     the semiconductor industry is characterized by wide fluctuations of supply
and demand throughout the last three fiscal years the industry experienced a
significant economic downturn characterized by diminished product demand and
production overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry
cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly
replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of
market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod
fluctuations in operating results and may in the future experience
periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or
economic conditions

we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims

     we are currently and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings
or claims regarding patent infringement intellectual property rights contracts
and other matters in addition as is typical in the semiconductor industry we
receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification
or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers
by third parties these legal proceedings and claims whether with or without
merit could result in substantial cost to us and divert our resources if we
are not able to resolve a claim negotiate a settlement of a matter obtain
necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms andor successfully
prosecute or defend our position our business financial condition or results
of operations could be harmed

                                       15

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in lost
revenue or market opportunities

     our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property
rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our
success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and
intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing
processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive
and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in
addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of
sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial
advantage to us we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings
in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial
and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do
not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
the united states infringement of our intellectual property rights by a third
party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for
us

we do not have longterm contracts with our customers

     we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and
we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers when we do
enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the
convenience of the customer in the event of any early termination of a contract
by one of our major customers it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly
replace that revenue source which would harm our financial results

business interruptions could harm our business

     operations at any of our primary manufacturing facilities or at any of our
wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors may be disrupted for
reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of
terrorism political instability public health issues such as sars
telecommunications failure fire earthquake floods or other natural
disasters if operations at any of our or our subcontractors facilities are
interrupted we may not be able to shift production to other facilities on a
timely basis if this occurs we may experience delays in shipments of products
to our customers and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on
acceptable terms this could result in reduced revenues and profits and the
cancellation of orders or loss of customers in addition business interruption
insurance will likely not be enough to compensate us for any losses that may
occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business
interruptions could significantly harm our business

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to
foreign political and economic risks

     sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net
sales during the fiscal year ended march 31 2003 approximately 71 of our net
sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our
raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product
assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand we also use
various foreign thirdparty contractors for a portion of our assembly and
testing and for a portion of our wafer fabrication requirements for our analog
and smart battery management products substantially all of our finished goods
inventory is maintained in thailand

     our reliance on foreign operations foreign suppliers maintenance of
substantially all of our finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and
significant foreign sales exposes us to foreign political and economic risks
including

     o    political social and economic instability
     o    trade restrictions and changes in tariffs
     o    import and export license requirements and restrictions
     o    difficulties in staffing and managing international operations
     o    employment regulations
     o    disruptions in international transport or delivery
     o    fluctuations in currency exchange rates
     o    difficulties in collecting receivables
     o    economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us and
     o    potentially adverse tax consequences

     if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our
operating results could suffer

current geopolitical turmoil public health concerns and the continuing threat
of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our
business

     international turmoil such as the recent war in iraq the tensions in
north korea and the sars outbreak have contributed to an uncertain political
and economic climate in the united states and in many of the countries in which
we conduct business these conditions make it difficult for us and our
customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could
harm our business

we are subject to stringent environmental regulation which may force us to
incur significant expenses

     we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental
regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic
volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process
although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable
environmental regulations our failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or
a cessation of operations any such regulation could require us to acquire
costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with
environmental regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately
restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future
liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future
costs or liabilities

our failure to successfully integrate businesses products or technologies we
acquire could disrupt or harm our ongoing business

     we have from time to time acquired and may in the future acquire
additional complementary businesses products and technologies achieving the
anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends upon whether the integration of
the acquired business products or technology is accomplished efficiently and
effectively in addition successful acquisitions in the semiconductor industry
may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries because such
acquisitions require among other things integration of product offerings
manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and rd
efforts these difficulties can become more challenging due to the need to
coordinate geographically separated organizations the complexities of the
technologies being integrated and the necessities of integrating personnel with
disparate business backgrounds and combining two different corporate cultures
the integration of operations following an acquisition also requires the
dedication of management resources which may distract attention from our
daytoday business and may disrupt key rd marketing or sales efforts the
inability of our management to successfully integrate any future acquisition
could harm our business furthermore products acquired in connection with
acquisitions may not gain acceptance in our markets and we may not achieve the
anticipated or desired benefits of such transaction

recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and related regulations
could result in increased costs to us

     recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting
public companies including the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and
rules proposed by the sec nasdaq and the nyse could result in increased costs
to us as we respond to their requirements the new rules could make it more
difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance including director and
officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy
limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or
similar coverage in this regard during our most recent annual renewal of our
director and officer liability insurance policy we experienced substantially
reduced policy limits and terms at a significant cost increase compared to our
prior coverage the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for
us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors
on committees of our board of directors or as executive officers we cannot
predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the
timing of such costs that we may incur as we implement these new and proposed
rules

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to a variety of factors

     the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the
past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our
common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of
factors many of which are beyond our control including

                                       17
page
     o    quarterly variations in our operating results and the operating
          results of other technology companies
     o    actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new
          products by us or our competitors
     o    changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance or
          buysell recommendations
     o    general conditions in the semiconductor industry and
     o    worldwide economic and financial conditions

     in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high
technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating
performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors
may harm the market price of our common stock

     at the end of fiscal 2003 we owned longlived assets in the united states
amounting to 11380 million and 2902 million in other countries including
1822 million in thailand at the end of fiscal 2002 we owned longlived
assets in the united states amounting to 9469 million and 3287 million in
other countries including 1639 million in thailand

     in addition to the facilities we own we lease numerous research and
development facilities and sales offices in north america europe and asia our
aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately
295000

     we currently believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet
our requirements for the next 12 months

     as conditions in the insurance market have become more difficult over the
last two fiscal years our property insurance cost have increased our coverage
levels have decreased and our retained risk exposure from uninsured losses has
increased we have not made any material change to our operations as a result of
the increased costs and reduced coverage availability and cost of coverage have
generally fluctuated over time as the insurance industry reacts to various
market forces and we will consider modifying our coverage levels in the future
based on availability and pricing

item 3 legal proceedings

     microchip technology incorporated v us philips corporation et al
district of arizona 01cv2090pgr us philips corporation v atmel
corporation et al southern district of new york 01cv9178lap as
previously reported on october 26 2001 we filed an action in federal district
court in arizona for declaratory relief against us philips corporation and
philips electronics north america corp requesting that the court declare among
other matters that we do not infringe philips us patent nos 4689740 and
5559502 we initiated legal action so that a determination could be made
relating to the validity enforceability and alleged infringement of and our
license to the philips patents in response to our filing the declaratory
judgment action in arizona philips filed an action against us in federal
district court in new york alleging infringement of the 740 patent and seeking
unspecified damages and injunctive relief the arizona court has agreed to
retain jurisdiction and the new york case has been transferred to arizona in
response to this development on december 16 2002 philips filed a demand for
arbitration in amsterdam with the international chamber of commerce we have
submitted to the icc court of arbitration a jurisdictional objection to
proceeding with arbitration pending the outcome of the arizona litigation but
the icc has not yet ruled on this objection additionally philips and we have
filed and briefed cross motions in the arizona action with philips seeing to
compel the arbitration in the icc while we are seeking to stay the arbitration
and proceed with the arizona action the cross motions have not been decided
pending a decision discovery has been stayed by agreement between philips and
us we intend to continue to litigate this matter vigorously we currently
believe that the outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations however the
final outcome of this matter is inherently uncertain and should the outcome be
adverse to us we may be required to pay damages and other expenses and may be
subjected to injunctive relief the litigation even if resolved in our favor
may also result in diversion of management attention and significant legal fees

     in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number
of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured
liability in any one or more of them although the outcome of these actions is
not presently determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not harm our business litigation relating to the semiconductor
industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject
to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or
outcome of any such litigation in the future

fab 1 wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain fab 1 personnel and
processes into our tempe arizona fab 2 wafer fabrication facility this
decision was made as a result of days of inventory at march 31 2003 reaching
128 days increasing from 110 days at december 31 2002 this increase in
inventory reflects the lower demand for our products that we experienced in the
march 2003 quarter we made the decision to close fab 1 in order to better align
our production capacity to current demand requirements this decision making
process included a review of our capacity including the forthcoming startup of
our gresham oregon fab 4 wafer fabrication facility which is required to
produce our more advanced products we expect to complete the integration
process during the quarter ending june 30 2003 after which fab 1 will cease to
operate as a wafer fabrication facility the closure of fab 1 and the
integration of certain fab 1 personnel into fab 2 operations will result in a
reduction in force of approximately 140 employees we expect that in the first
quarter of fiscal 2004 we will incur accelerated depreciation charges and other
expenses related to the shut down of fab 1 of between 27 million and 33
million

change in accounting principle

     we have historically recognized revenue from sales to our americas
european and multinational asian distributors at point of sale pos or when
those distributors sell our products to their customers and prior to fiscal
2003 we recognized revenue on sales to regional asian distributors at point of
purchase pop or when we shipped product to these distributors upon shipment
amounts billed to distributors at pos are included as accounts receivable
inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as
a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to its
customers

     on march 18 2003 we announced that we would change our revenue
recognition policy relating to regional asian distributors from pop to pos we
believe that revenue recognition at pos for sales to distributors as our sole
revenue recognition policy worldwide is a more reflective measure of end
customer demand for our products to implement the change in revenue
recognition we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle of 114 million net of income taxes of 66 million as of april 1
2002 the beginning of fiscal 2003 the cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle was calculated by multiplying the quantity of our inventory
that the regional asia distributors maintained as of april 1 2002 by the gross
margin we would realize on those sales net of related income tax we restated
our quarterly results for fiscal 2003 to conform to the change in accounting
principle and have included at note 23 of our consolidated financial statements
a comparative table of our earnings for the first three quarters of fiscal 2003
with and without the change in accounting principle the restatement of the
first three quarters of fiscal 2003 resulted in a cumulative reduction in
revenue of approximately 87 million and a cumulative reduction in net income
of approximately 24 million or 01 per share

critical accounting policies and estimates

     general

     our discussion and analysis of microchips financial condition and results
of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting
our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our
estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income
taxes property plant and equipment litigation and impairment of property

                                       24
page
plant and equipment and assets held for sale we base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due
to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions
we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we believe the
following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

     revenue recognition

     we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems for sales
recorded upon shipment we record reserves to cover the estimated customer
returns returns have historically been less than 15 of sales to the extent
rates of return change our estimates for the reserves necessary to cover such
returns would also change our distributors have broad rights to return products
and price protection rights so we defer revenue recognition until the
distributor sells the product to their customers upon shipment amounts billed
to distributors are included as accounts receivable inventory is relieved the
sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until
the product is sold by the distributor to their customers we changed our
revenue recognition policy as it relates to sales to asia regional distributors
during fiscal 2003 as described above at page 24 and in note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements

     inventories

     inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin
firstout fifo method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence
or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost
of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable
than those we projected are additional inventory writedowns may be required
inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and
charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later
suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our
reserves for obsolescence we generally evaluate estimates of demand over a
12month period which is based on the most recent quarter multiplied by four and
provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated 12month
demand

     income taxes

     as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax
exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in
deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated
balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction
and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a
valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we
believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be
recovered from future taxable income should we determine that we would not be
able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period
such determination was made at march 31 2003 our gross deferred tax asset was
1165 million

     numerous taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business are
increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses we
believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax
liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries if such amounts
ultimately prove to be unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves
would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no
longer deemed necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the
ultimate assessment a future charge to expense would result

     the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax
asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forwardlooking statements
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among
others results of any audit conducted by the various taxing authorities in the
countries in which we do business the level of our taxable income and whether
our taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits available from our
deferred tax assets current and future tax laws and regulations and taxation
rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations

     property plant  equipment

     property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and
improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when
incurred at march 31 2003 the carrying value of our property and equipment
totaled 7679 million which represents 538 of our total assets this
carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting
policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgements relative to
the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a
straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which
range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 30
years on buildings

     fab 4 has not been placed in service and the related depreciation of the
assets at fab 4 has not commenced the lives to be used for depreciating the
equipment at fab 4 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in
service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired
the estimated life or values of the underlying assets

     in april 2003 we announced our intention to close fab 1 and integrate
certain fab 1 personnel and processes into fab 2 we expect to complete the
integration process during the quarter ended june 30 2003 after which fab 1
will cease to operate as a wafer fabrication facility the closure of fab 1 and
the integration of certain fab 1 personnel into fab 2 operations will result in
a reduction in force of approximately 140 employees we expect that in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004 we will incur accelerated depreciation charges on
the underlying assets and other expenses related to the shut down of fab 1

     the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our
property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and
expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of
different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our
property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and
operations would likely result in materially different carrying values of
assets and results of operations

     we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility
resides the land is subject to a complex restructuring situation relating to
the seller of the land we have provided reserves that we estimate will be
adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value
of the land however timing of the resolution and the ultimate amount to be
paid could change

     litigation

     our current estimated range of liability related to certain pending
litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the
amount and range of loss and recorded reserves were not significant at march
31 2003

     because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and
the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation we are unable
to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an
unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available we will assess
the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our
estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could
materially impact our results of operation and financial position

     impairment of property plant and equipment and assets held for sale

     we assess whether indicators of impairment of longlived assets are
present if such indicators are present we determine whether the sum of the
estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less
than their carrying value if less we recognize an impairment loss based on the
excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows appraisals or other
methods if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used we
recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the
extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset
are less than the assets carrying value which we depreciate over the remaining
estimated useful life of the asset we may incur impairment losses or
additional losses on already impaired assets in future periods if factors
influencing our estimates change

     net sales

     we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design
development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our
products to distributors and oems in a broad range of market segments perform
ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no
collateral

     our net sales of 6515 million in fiscal 2003 increased by 802 million
or 140 over fiscal 2002 and net sales of 5713 million in fiscal 2002
decreased by 1445 million or 202 over fiscal 2001 the increase in net
sales in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from increased
demand predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller and analog and
interface products the decrease in net sales in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
2001 resulted primarily from slowing demand from end markets and to a lesser
extent from inventory corrections at our customers overall semiconductor
industry conditions and serial eeprom pricing declines we believe that we have
continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market
over the last three fiscal years key factors that have driven our net sales
performance during the last three fiscal years include

     o    continued market share gains
     o    increasing semiconductor content in our customers products
     o    our new product offerings that have increased our served available
          market and
     o    increasing demand for our programmable products

     sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2003 2002 and
2001 were as follows dollars in thousands

     certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period
amounts to the current period presentation

     microcontrollers

     our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our
total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems
accounted for approximately 79 of our total net sales in fiscal 2003
approximately 78 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002 and approximately 66 of
our total net sales in fiscal 2001

                                       27
page
     net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 17 in
fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in net sales was primarily
due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets driven
principally by market share gains and those factors described above under net
sales at page 27 the end markets that we serve include the automotive
communications computing consumer and industrial control markets during
fiscal 2002 the semiconductor industry experienced significant demand reductions
based on overall market conditions net sales of our microcontroller products
decreased approximately 5 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 the decrease
in net sales of our microcontroller products was significantly lower than the
decrease in our other product lines due primarily to our continuing design win
performance and the overall positioning of our proprietary product offerings

     historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease
over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of
our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to
the proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to
continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller
product lines primarily due to competitive conditions we have been able to in
the past and expect to be able to in the future moderate average selling price
declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with
more features and higher prices we may be unable to maintain average selling
prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing
pressure in the future which would adversely affect our operating results

     memory products

     sales of our memory products accounted for approximately 13 of our total
net sales in fiscal 2003 approximately 15 of our total net sales in fiscal
2002 and approximately 25 of our total net sales in fiscal 2001

     net sales of our memory products increased approximately 2 in fiscal 2003
compared to fiscal 2002 driven primarily by customer demand conditions within
the serial eeprom market which products comprise substantially all of our
memory product net sales net sales of our memory products decreased by
approximately 52 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 driven by over supply
in the market and significant pricing pressures

     serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature
with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability
driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business
cycle during the past three fiscal years we have experienced several serial
eeprom product pricing trends due to market conditions in fiscal 2001 we
experienced product pricing increases due to supply constraints within the
market we experienced significant competitive downward pricing pressures in our
serial eeprom product lines during the first half of fiscal 2002 returning to
modest pricing declines in the second half of fiscal 2002 we experienced modest
pricing declines in our serial eeprom product lines during fiscal 2003 compared
to fiscal 2002 we have experienced and expect to continue to experience
varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products
we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom
products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would
adversely affect our operating results

     analog and interface products

     sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately 7
of our total net sales in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 and approximately 10 of
our total net sales in fiscal 2001

     net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately 13
in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 driven primarily by new proprietary
design wins supply and demand conditions within the market and our ability to
gain market share net sales of our analog and interface products decreased
approximately 39 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 as a result of
decreased demand primarily in the telecommunications market

     analog and interface products can be proprietary or nonproprietary in
nature currently we consider approximately 45 of our analog and interface
product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are relatively stable
similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products
the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience
price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those
products during fiscal 2003 pricing of our nonproprietary analog and
interface products was approximately flat compared to fiscal 2002 during fiscal
2002 our analog and interface products experienced price reductions of
approximately 25 compared to fiscal 2001 the price decreases experienced in
fiscal 2002 can be primarily attributed to the supply and demand environment and

                                       28
page
the integration of the telcom products into our pricing structure we may be
unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface
products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which would
adversely affect our operating results we anticipate the proprietary portion of
our analog and interface products to increase over time

     turns orders

     our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments
from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter
which we refer to as turns orders we measure turns orders at the beginning of a
quarter based on the orders needed to meet the revenue target that we set
entering the quarter we emphasize our ability to respond quickly to customer
orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers placing
orders with short delivery schedules turns orders directly correlate to product
lead times which are generally three weeks or less for the majority of our
products essentially unchanged from lead times a year ago shorter lead times
generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively
high in any particular quarter and reduces our visibility on future product
shipments with current lead times for the majority of our products being three
weeks or less generally customers do not place orders beyond their immediate
requirements

     the percentage of turns orders in any given quarter is dependent on overall
semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times as such our
percentage of turns orders required in any particular quarter has fluctuated
over the last three fiscal years between 20 and 62 during fiscal 2003 our
turns orders were at the high end of this range

     turns orders are difficult to predict and we may not experience the
combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in a quarter that would
be sufficient to achieve anticipated net sales if we do not achieve a
sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter our net sales and
operating results will suffer

     the foregoing statements regarding competitive pricing pressure in our
microcontroller serial eeprom and analog and interface product lines our
ability to moderate future average selling price declines in our microcontroller
product lines and the proprietary portion of our analog and interface product
lines increasing over time are forwardlooking statements actual results could
differ materially because of the following factors among others the level of
orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter changes in demand for
our products and the products of our customers the level and timing at which
previous design wins become actual orders and sales inventory mix and timing of
customer orders customers inventory levels order patterns and seasonality
level of sellthrough of our products through distribution in any particular
fiscal period our ability to ramp products into volume production competition
and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability disruptions in
commercial activities or international transport or delivery occasioned by
terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price
of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases
relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states such as
the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political
instability the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the
markets addressed by our products market acceptance of our new products and
those of our customers the financial condition of our customers fluctuations
in production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization
changes in product mix absorption of fixed costs labor and other fixed
manufacturing costs and general industry economic and political conditions

     distribution

     distributors accounted for 60 of our net sales in fiscal 2003 62 of our
net sales in fiscal 2002 and 65 of our net sales in fiscal 2001

     our largest distributor accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in
fiscal 2003 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 and 14 of our net sales in
fiscal 2001

     generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and
we or our distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little
or no advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one
or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter
and could result in an increase in inventory returns

     at march 31 2003 distributors were maintaining an average of
approximately 25 months of inventory of our products over the past three
fiscal years the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have
fluctuated between approximately 23 and 38 months while inventory levels at
our distributors are at the low end of the range we have experienced over the
last three years we would not anticipate any significant change in inventory
holding patterns until lead times for our products and the industry generally

                                       29
page
extend beyond the current levels as we recognize revenue based on sell through
for all of our distributors we do not believe that inventory holding patterns
at our distributors will impact our net sales

     the foregoing statements regarding our anticipation that distributor
inventory holding patterns will not significantly change until lead times for
our products and the industry in general extend beyond the current levels and
our belief that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will not impact
our net sales are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ
materially because of the following factors among others the rate of recovery
in the overall economy and the uncertainty of current economic and political
conditions changes in demand for our products and the products of our
customers the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual
orders and sales inventory mix and timing of customer orders customers
inventory levels order patterns and seasonality the impact on our business and
customer order patterns due to major public health concern such as the spread
of the sars virus level of sellthrough of our products through distribution in
any particular fiscal period disruptions in commercial activities or
international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity armed
conflict war or an unexpected increase in the price of or decrease in the
supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations
impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of
fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability the cyclical
nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our
products market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers and
the financial condition of our customers

     sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 71 of our net sales
in fiscal 2003 approximately 69 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 and
approximately 68 of our net sales in each of fiscal 2001 the majority of our
foreign sales are us dollar denominated

     sales to customers in china accounted for approximately 13 of our net
sales in fiscal 2003 we did not have sales into any other countries that
exceeded 10 of our net sales during the periods covered by this report

     gross profit

     our gross profit was 3522 million in fiscal 2003 2867 million in
fiscal 2002 and 3807 million in fiscal 2001 gross profit as a percent of
sales was 541 in fiscal 2003 502 in fiscal 2002 and 532 in fiscal 2001

     the most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage over the
past three fiscal years were

     o    higher levels of manufacturing capacity utilization in fiscal 2003
          compared to fiscal 2002
     o    reduced levels of manufacturing capacity utilization in fiscal 2002
          compared to fiscal 2001
     o    continued cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test
          manufacturing
     o    our ability to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller
          products where moderate downward pricing pressures have been offset by
          introduction of new products with more features and higher selling
          prices
     o    varying positive and negative factors impacting the average selling
          prices of our serial eeprom products

                                       30
page
     o    fluctuations in the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and
          analog products and related serial eeprom products
     o    the sale of inventory that was previously reserved for and
     o    oneweek plant shutdowns in each quarter of fiscal 2002

     by march 31 2001 we reduced cumulative wafer capacity at fab 1 and fab 2
by approximately 24 compared to our december 31 2000 levels in response to
business conditions that resulted in decreased product demand during fiscal
2002 we operated at approximately 70 of our cumulative total fab 1 and fab 2
capacity due to the capacity reductions implemented in the march 2001 quarter
and oneweek plant shutdowns in each quarter of fiscal 2002 our overall gross
margins in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by these actions due to the
relatively high fixed costs inherent in our wafer fabrication manufacturing
during fiscal 2003 we operated at approximately 85 of our cumulative total fab
1 and fab 2 capacity which favorably impacted gross margins compared to fiscal
2002

     the process technologies utilized and the size of the wafers on which our
products are produced impact our gross margins fabs 1 and 2 currently utilize
various manufacturing process technologies but predominantly utilize our 05 to
10micron processes we continue to transition products to more advanced
process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs in fiscal 2002 and
fiscal 2003 approximately 80 of our production was on 8inch wafers in fiscal
2001 approximately 62 of our production was on 8inch wafers all of our
production will be on 8inch wafers once the fab 1 personnel and processes are
integrated into fab 2

     our overall inventory levels were 1023 million at march 31 2003
compared to 886 million at march 31 2002 and 957 million at march 31 2001
we had 128 days of inventory on our balance sheet at march 31 2003 compared to
110 days at march 31 2002 and 114 days at march 31 2001 see item 7 
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations  recent development beginning at page 24 above for a discussion
of our anticipated actions related to our overall inventory levels

     we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time driven
primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller analog and interface
and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in
a particular quarter as well as manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption
wafer fab loading levels and competitive and economic conditions

     the foregoing statements relating to our transition to advanced process
technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs and the fluctuation of gross
margins over time are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ
materially because of the following factors among others changes in demand for
our products and the products of our customers fluctuations in production
yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization changes in
capacity utilization absorption of fixed costs labor and other direct
manufacturing costs competition and competitive pressure on pricing
disruptions in commercial activities or international transport or delivery
occasioned by terrorist activity armed conflict war or an unexpected increase
in the price of or decrease in the supply of oil resulting in reduced enduser
purchases relative to expectations impact of events outside the united states
such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political
instability our ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed cost and
availability of raw materials changes in product mix and other general
industry economic and political conditions

     at march 31 2003 approximately 77 of our assembly requirements were
being performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 53 as of
march 31 2002 thirdparty contractors located throughout asia perform the
balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements
were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2003 and march 31
2002 we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand
facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to thirdparty
contractor assembly and test costs as well as increased control over these
portions of the manufacturing process

     our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control
over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review the
quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our
future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to
maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at
approximately their current levels

     research and development rd

     rd expenses for fiscal 2003 were 880 million or 135 of sales
compared to 817 million or 143 of sales for fiscal 2002 and 786
million or 110 of sales for fiscal 2001 we are committed to investing in
new and enhanced products including development systems software and in our
design and manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are
significant factors in maintaining our competitive position we expense all rd
costs as incurred rd expenses include expenditures for labor depreciation
masks prototype wafers and expenses for the development of process
technologies new packages and software to support new products and design
environments

     rd expenses increased 63 million or 77 for fiscal 2003 over fiscal
2002 rd expenses increased 31 million or 39 for fiscal 2002 over fiscal
2001 the primary reason for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2003
over fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was increased labor and professional service
costs associated with expanding our technical resources and the ongoing rd
expenses acquired as part of the acquisition of powersmart inc described at
special charges  fiscal 2003  powersmart inprocess research and development
charge below at page 33 rd expenses would have been higher in fiscal 2002 if
we had not implemented unpaid oneweek shutdowns in each of the first two
quarters of fiscal 2002

     selling general and administrative

     selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2003 were 894
million or 137 of sales compared to 826 million or 145 of sales for
fiscal 2002 and 1026 million or 144 of sales for fiscal 2001 selling
general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field
sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional
expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses
also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications
engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting
customers in the selection and use of our products

     selling general and administrative expenses increased 67 million or
82 for fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 the primary reason for the dollar
increase in selling general and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 over fiscal
2002 relate to increased labor costs due to increases in headcount salaries and
bonuses selling general and administrative expenses decreased 200 million
or 195 for fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 primarily due to reductions in
wages bonuses and recruitment costs and unpaid oneweek shutdowns in each of
the first two quarters of fiscal 2002

     selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily
due to revenue and operating expense levels

     fab 3 impairment charge

     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards no 144 sfas 144 accounting
for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which is applicable to
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 sfas
144 provides a single accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed of
and significantly changes the criteria that must be met to classify an asset as
heldforsale classification as heldforsale is an important distinction
because assets heldforsale are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of
book value or fair value less cost to sell sfas 144 is effective for all of our
financial statements issued subsequent to april 1 2002 in accordance with sfas
144 we recorded a 415 million asset impairment charge during the quarter
ended september 30 2002 as described below

     we acquired fab 3 a semiconductor manufacturing facility in puyallup
washington in july 2000 the original purchase consisted of semiconductor
manufacturing facilities and real property it was our intention to bring fab 3
to productive readiness and commence volume production of 8inch wafers using
our 07 and 05 micron process technologies by august 2001 we delayed our
production start up at fab 3 due to deteriorating business conditions in the
semiconductor industry during fiscal 2002 fab 3 has never been brought to
productive readiness

     on august 23 2002 we acquired fab 4 a semiconductor manufacturing
facility in gresham oregon see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
on page f11 below we decided to purchase fab 4 instead of bringing fab 3 to
productive readiness because among other things the cost of the manufacturing
equipment needed to ramp production at fab 3 over the next several years was
significantly higher than the total purchase price of fab 4 and the time to
bring fab 4 to productive readiness was significantly less than the time
required to bring fab 3 to productive readiness

     after the acquisition of fab 4 was completed we undertook an analysis of
the potential production capacity at fab 4 the results of the production
capacity analysis led us to determine that fab 3s capacity would not be needed
in the foreseeable future and during the september 2002 quarter we committed to
a plan to sell fab 3 we have retained a thirdparty broker to market fab 3 on
our behalf accordingly fab 3 was classified as an asset heldforsale as of
september 30 2002 and maintained that classification at march 31 2003

     we retained an independent thirdparty firm other than our independent
auditors to complete a fair value appraisal of fab 3 the independent third
party used the market approach and considered sales of comparable properties in
determining the fair value of fab 3 the comparable sales included eight
properties including our purchases of fab 3 in july 2000 and fab 4 in august
2002 based on the results of this appraisal we recorded an asset impairment
charge on fab 3 of 369 million including estimated costs to sell the
remaining value of 602 million is classified as an asset heldforsale and is
included as a component of other current assets at march 31 2003

     during the quarter ended september 30 2002 we also recorded an asset
impairment charge of 46 million to writedown certain excess manufacturing
equipment located at fab 3 to its net realizable value of 212000 this
manufacturing equipment became excess as a result of duplicate equipment
acquired in the purchase of fab 4 the net realizable value for the excess
manufacturing equipment was determined based on management estimates
substantially all of the other manufacturing equipment located at fab 3 has been
transferred to and will be used in our other wafer fabrication facilities
located in tempe arizona fab 2 and gresham oregon fab 4

     if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated in the
appraisal or if future market conditions deteriorate the net proceeds from the
assets heldforsale could be less than the amount estimated in the financial
statements and additional charges could result prior to or at the time of the
sale of the facility

     powersmart inprocess research and development charge

     during the quarter ended june 30 2002 purchased inprocess research and
development of 93 million associated with our acquisition of powersmart inc
was written off at the date of the acquisition june 5 2002 in accordance with
fasb interpretation no 4 applicability of fasb statement no 2 business
combinations accounted for by the purchase method fin 4 the value assigned
to the inprocess research and development was determined by an independent
valuation analysis performed by a firm other than our independent auditors as
of the valuation date there were 15 projects that were considered to be in
process the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of cash
flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the

                                       33
page
inprocess projects these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total
revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating
expenses cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a
forecast of net return on inprocess technology these net returns were
substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks
associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving
commercial readiness the above analysis resulted in 93 million of value
assigned to acquired inprocess research and development which was expensed on
the acquisition date in accordance with fin 4 we believe the assumptions used
in valuing the inprocess research and development are reasonable but are
inherently uncertain and no assurance can be given that the assumptions made
will occur during fiscal 2003 we incurred development costs of approximately
32 million related to the acquired inprocess research and development and
should the projects continue to move toward commercialization we estimate that
future expenditures could approximate 20 million over the next few years none
of the inprocess research and development projects had been completed as of
march 31 2003

     the foregoing statement relating to our estimated future expenditures on
the acquired inprocess rd projects is a forwardlooking statement actual
results could differ materially because of the following factors among others
delays in completion of a particular project changes in our prioritization of
projects changes in the specifications of a particular project unforeseen
engineering problems and unanticipated costs

fiscal 2002

     there were no special charges incurred during fiscal 2002

fiscal 2001

     during the march 2001 quarter we implemented capacity and cost reduction
actions necessitated by adverse business conditions in the semiconductor
industry we reduced cumulative wafer fab capacity at fabs 1 and 2 by
approximately 24 compared to our december 31 2000 levels we also decided to
close our hong kong test facility acquired as part of the telcom transaction
and migrate these test requirements to our thailand test facility the capacity
reduction at fabs 1 and 2 was completed by the end of the march 2001 quarter
the closure of the hong kong facility was completed by june 30 2001 these
actions resulted in a restructuring charge of 64 million in the march 2001
quarter these actions were undertaken to reduce both manufacturing capacity and
manufacturing costs the reduction in wafer fab capacity was required due to
reduced customer demand the closure of the hong kong facility was undertaken to
rationalize our test manufacturing capacity and migrate the test requirements to
our more costeffective test facility in thailand

     included in the restructuring charges resulting from these actions were

     o    40 million related to equipment that was written off
     o    21 million related to employee severance costs and
     o    03 million related to other restructuring costs

     on january 16 2001 we completed our merger with telcom under the terms
of the merger agreement we exchanged each share of telcom common stock for
0795 of a share of our common stock we issued 14702184 shares of our common
stock and assumed all outstanding telcom stock options the transaction was
structured as a taxfree reorganization and has been accounted for as a
poolingofinterests

     during the march 2001 quarter we recognized a special charge of 109
million for costs associated with the telcom transaction these costs included

     o    73 million associated with investment banking fees
     o    16 million associated with legal and accounting fees
     o    09 million of severance costs and
     o    11 million related to other costs

     all reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal 2001 actions
have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously provided
amounts

     other income expense

     interest income in fiscal 2003 decreased from interest income in fiscal
2002 as our average invested cash balances and the interest rates applicable to
our invested cash balances were lower in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
interest income in fiscal 2002 decreased from interest income in fiscal 2001
although average invested cash balances were higher in fiscal 2002 the decrease
in interest income in fiscal 2002 was primarily driven by significantly lower
interest rates applicable to our invested cash balances during fiscal 2002
compared to the interest rates during fiscal 2001

     provision for income taxes

     provisions for income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and
state tax on us earnings our effective tax rate was 223 in fiscal 2003
255 in fiscal 2002 and 272 in fiscal 2001 and is lower than statutory rates
in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations
and rd tax credits the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2003
compared to fiscal 2002 was due to the impairment portion of the special charges
which provided an income tax benefit at a greater rate than our historic
effective rate given the 40 tax jurisdiction in which it occurred excluding
special charges our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 253 the decrease
in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 related to
increased rd tax credits that were available to us

     as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax
exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in
deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated
balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset
will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction
and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a
valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we
believe that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable
income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of
our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax
asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at
march 31 2003 our gross deferred tax asset was 1165 million various taxing
authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are
increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses we
believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax
liabilities that may arise upon audit in the united states and other countries
in which we do business if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the
resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded
in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary if such amounts
ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment a future charge to
expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined

     our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax
holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our
investments in property plant and equipment in thailand although our tax
holidays in thailand will partially expire in october 2003 our manufacturing
operations in thailand will be conducted using equipment that was invested
pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until september 2006 we
believe that the expiration of a portion of our tax holiday in thailand will not
have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal 2004

     companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing
authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations
we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service for our fiscal
years ended march 31 1998 1999 2000 and 2001

     the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax
asset from our future taxable income the adequacy of our tax reserves to offset
any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit and our belief that the
expiration of a portion of our thai tax holiday will not have a material adverse
impact on our fiscal 2004 effective tax rate are forwardlooking statements
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among
others current and future tax laws and regulations taxation rates in
geographic regions where we have significant operations results of any current
or future audit conducted by the us internal revenue service or other taxing
authorities in the countries in which we do business and the level of our
taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize our
deferred tax asset

liquidity and capital resources

     we had 2165 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments
at march 31 2003 a decrease of 641 million from the march 31 2002 balance
the decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments over this time
period is primarily attributable to the cash used in our june 5 2002
acquisition of powersmart and our august 23 2002 acquisition of fab 4 offset
by cash generated from operating activities

     on february 25 2003 we elected to terminate our unsecured revolving
credit facility that we had maintained with a syndicate of banks since may 2000
the 1000 million credit facility was due to expire on may 31 2003 there were
no borrowings against the credit facility on february 25 2003 we did not
borrow against the credit facility in either fiscal 2003 or fiscal 2002

     during the fiscal year ended march 31 2003 we maintained an unsecured
shortterm line of credit with various financial institutions in asia totaling
200 million us dollar equivalent there were no borrowings under the
foreign line of credit as of march 31 2003 but an allocation of approximately
09 million of the available line was made relating to import guarantees
associated with our business in thailand there are no covenants related to the
foreign line of credit

     net cash provided from operating activities was 2602 million for fiscal
2003 1788 million for fiscal 2002 and 2544 million for fiscal 2001 the
increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to our results of
operations after consideration of noncash special charges pretax income in
fiscal 2003 increased approximately 519 million compared to fiscal 2002 after
consideration of noncash special charges

     net cash used in investing activities was 3768 million for fiscal 2003
1387 million for fiscal 2002 and 3991 million in fiscal 2001 the increase
in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was
primarily due to our acquisitions of fab 4 and powersmart increases in our
shortterm investment balances and increased capital expenditures

     we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to
minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the
countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly
inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that
inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we
conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the
future

     our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of
actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 2651
million in fiscal 2003 447 million in fiscal 2002 and 4411 million in
fiscal 2001 the primary reasons for the dollar increase in capital expenditures
in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 were the purchase of fab 4 other
selective investments to increase our manufacturing capacity in response to
market demand and our continued investment in rd equipment in each of fiscal
2002 and fiscal 2001 capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of
production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment we
currently intend to spend approximately 45 million during the next 12 months to
invest in equipment and facilities to maintain and selectively increase
capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs

     at march 31 2003 we had contractual obligations of approximately 116
million for the purchase or construction of property plant and equipment the
majority of these contractual obligations mature in the quarter ending june 30
2003

     we expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash
balances cash flows from operations available debt arrangements and other
sources of financing including possible issuances of equity and debt securities
depending on market conditions we believe that the capital expenditures
anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide sufficient
manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs

     the foregoing statements regarding the anticipated level of capital
expenditures over the next 12 months the nature of such expenditures the
financing and sufficiency of our capital expenditures and the belief that
capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will
provide us sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated
needs are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially
because of the following factors among others changes in demand for our
products and those of our customers changes in utilization of current
manufacturing capacity unanticipated costs in bringing fab 4 online market
acceptance of our products and of our customers products the cyclical nature
of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products the
availability and cost of raw materials equipment and other supplies actual
levels of capital expenditures the costs and outcome of any litigation

     net cash used in financing activities was 31 million for fiscal 2003 net
cash provided by financing activities was 161 million for fiscal 2002 and
1095 million for fiscal 2001 proceeds from the sale of stock the exercise of
stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were
315 million for fiscal 2003 438 million for fiscal 2002 and 1185 million
for fiscal 2001 repayments on lines of credit were 90 million in fiscal 2001
cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was 265 million in fiscal
2003 and 278 million in fiscal 2002

     on august 7 2002 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up
to 2500000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions as of march 31 2003 we had repurchased 1264700
shares of common stock for 27062782 as of march 31 2003 all but 311855 of
the purchased shares had been reissued to fund stock option exercises and

future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate
considerations

     on october 28 2002 we announced that our board of directors had approved
and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the initial
quarterly dividend of 002 per share was paid on december 6 2003 in the amount
of 4060766 a second quarterly dividend payment of 002 per share was paid
on february 28 2003 in the amount of 4068480 a third quarterly dividend of
0024 per share was declared on april 24 2003 and was paid on may 29 2003 in
the amount of 4893296

     we maintained a net shares settled forward contract during the years ended
march 31 2002 and 2001 the table below contains a summary of the share and
cash activity under this contract

     during fiscal 2002 we made a net delivery of 572645 shares of our common
stock we also received approximately 141 million in connection with an early
termination covering 1650000 of the shares outstanding under the net shares
settled forward contract we closed out the net shares settled forward contract
in its entirety on january 15 2002 and made a cash payment of 278 million to
purchase the remaining 1610606 shares outstanding under the contract the
purchased shares were held as treasury shares and were used to fund stock option
exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan through april 9
2002

     we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated
cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor
industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must
constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital
equipment for both production and research and development we may seek
additional equity or debt financing during the next 12 months for the capital
expenditures required to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product
assembly and test facilities or other purposes the timing and amount of any
such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors including demand
for our products changes in industry conditions product mix and competitive
factors there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on
acceptable terms and any additional equity financing would result in
incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders

recently issued accounting pronouncements

     sfas 146

     in june 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no 146 sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities sfas no 146 supersedes emerging issues task force no 943 eitf
943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other
costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring
sfas 146 eliminates the provisions of eitf 943 that required a liability to be
recognized for certain exit or disposal activities at the date an entity
committed to an exit plan sfas no 146 requires a liability for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized when the liability
is incurred sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after december 31 2002 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 146 to
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

     sfas 148

     in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting
standards no 148 sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased
compensationtransition and disclosure sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123
accounting for stockbased compensation to provide alternative methods of
transition to sfas no 123s fair value method of accounting for stockbased
employee compensation sfas no 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of
sfas no 123 and apb 28 interim financial reporting to require disclosure in
the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entitys
accounting policy with respect to stockbased employee compensation on reported
net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements
while sfas no 148 does not amend sfas no 123 to require companies to account
for employee stock options using the fair value method the disclosure
provisions of sfas no 148 are applicable to all companies with stockbased
employee compensation regardless of whether they account for that compensation
using the fair value method of sfas no 123 or the intrinsic value method of apb
25 as allowed by sfas no 123 we have elected to continue to utilize the
accounting method prescribed by apb 25 and have adopted the disclosure
requirements of sfas no 123 as of march 31 2003

     fin 45

     in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 fin 45
guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees fin 45
requires a guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability
for the fair value of the obligation it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee
we will apply fin 45 to guarantees if any issued after december 15 2002 at
adoption fin 45 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
statements of income or financial position fin 45 also requires guarantors to
disclose certain information for guarantees including product warranties
outstanding at march 31 2003

     fin 46

     in january 2003 the fasb issued fin no 46 consolidation of variable
interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51
fin no 46 requires certain variable interest entities or vies to be
consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in
the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest
or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties
fin no 46 is effective for all vies created or acquired after january 31 2003
for vies created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin
no 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after
june 15 2003 we currently have no contractual relationship or other business
relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore we do not expect
the adoption of fin no 46 to have a material effect on our consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities was 2087
million as of march 31 2003 and 2476 million as of march 31 2002 these
securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk
and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market rates
were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from the levels of march 31
2003 and march 31 2002 the decline in the fair value of our investment
portfolio would not be material given that the our investments typically have
interest rate reset features that regularly adjust to current market rates
additionally we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until
maturity and therefore we would not expect to recognize any material adverse
impact in income or cash flows

     we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency
rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has
not been significant if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates
at march 31 2003 and march 31 2002 the effect on our financial position and
results of operation would not be material given that we enter into
foreigncurrency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency
rate fluctuations

     during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a
variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to
interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discuss in this
item 7a and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these
risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the
adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not
anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made
that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future

industry background

     competitive pressures require manufacturers to expand product functionality
and provide differentiation while maintaining or reducing cost to address these
requirements manufacturers use integrated circuitbased embedded control
systems that provide an integrated solution for applicationspecific control
requirements embedded control systems enable our customers to

         differentiate their products
         replace less efficient electromechanical control devices
         add product functionality and
         significantly reduce product cost
page
     in addition embedded control systems facilitate the emergence of complete
new classes of products embedded control solutions have been incorporated into
thousands of products and subassemblies in a wide variety of markets worldwide
including

  automotive air bag systems     cordless and cellular telephone accessories
  remote control devices         motor controls
  handheld tools                 security systems
  appliances                     educational and entertainment devices and
  portable computers             personal digital assistant pda accessories

     embedded control systems typically incorporate a microcontroller as the
principal active and sometimes sole component a microcontroller is a
selfcontained computeronachip consisting of a central processing unit
nonvolatile program memory random access memory for data storage and various
inputoutput capabilities in addition to the microcontroller a complete
embedded control system incorporates applicationspecific software and may
include specialized peripheral device controllers and internal or external
nonvolatile memory components such as eeproms to store additional program
software

     the increasing demand for embedded control has made the market for
microcontrollers one of the largest segments of the semiconductor market
microcontrollers are currently available in 4bit through 32bit architectures
although 4bit microcontrollers are relatively inexpensive typically costing
under 100 each they generally lack the minimum performance and features
required by todays design engineers for product differentiation and are
typically used only to produce basic functionality in products while 16 and
32bit architectures provide very high performance they are prohibitively
expensive for most highvolume embedded control applications typically costing
600 to 1000 each as a result manufacturers of competitive highvolume
products have increasingly found 8bit microcontrollers that typically cost
about 100 to 600 each to be the most costeffective embedded control
solution for example a typical new automobile may include one 32bit
microcontroller for engine control three 16bit microcontrollers for
transmission control audio systems and antilock braking and up to 50 8bit
microcontrollers to provide other embedded control functions such as door
locking automatic windows sun roof adjustable seats electric mirrors air
bags fuel pump speedometer and the security and climate control systems

     most microcontrollers available today are rombased and must be programmed
by the semiconductor supplier during manufacturing resulting in 5 to 15week
lead times based on current market conditions for delivery of such
microcontrollers in addition to delayed product introduction these long lead
times can result in potential inventory obsolescence and temporary factory
shutdowns when changes to the firmware are required to address timetomarket
constraints some suppliers have made eprom eeprom or flash memorybased
programmable microcontrollers available for prototyping and preproduction runs
however these microcontrollers have been relatively expensive and
manufacturers have still been required to send program code to the semiconductor
factory for rom programming as product changes are made as a result the long
lead times for production volume microcontrollers have not been significantly
reduced by traditional approaches

microcontrollers to customers worldwide since their introduction in 1990 our
picr products are designed for applications requiring fieldprogrammability
high performance low power and cost effectiveness they feature a variety of
memory technology configurations low voltage and power small footprint and
ease of use our performance results from an exclusive product architecture
which features dual data and instruction pathways referred to as a harvard
dualbus architecture a reduced instruction set referred to as risc and
variable length instructions all of which provide significant speed advantages
over the alternative singlebus cisc architectures prices for our
microcontroller products currently range from approximately 046 to 1000 per
unit in volume quantities

     our original market focus was in the lowcost segment of the 8bit
microcontroller marketplace with our baseline products we built our current
market position as the leading worldwide supplier of field programmable
microcontrollers over the past eight years we have introduced more than 152
new microcontrollers targeted at the baseline midrange highend and enhanced
architecture segments of the traditional 8bit microcontroller marketplace
additionally with our scalable product architecture we have successfully
targeted both the entry level of the 16bit microcontroller market as well as
the higher end of the 4bit microcontroller marketplace significantly enlarging
our addressable market

     we have used our manufacturing experience and design and process technology
to bring additional enhancements and manufacturing efficiencies to the
development and production of our picr family of microcontroller products our
extensive experience base has enabled us to develop our advanced low cost user

     our family of development tools operates in the standard windowsr
environment on standard pc hardware entrylevel systems which include an
assembler and programmer or incircuit debugging hardware are priced at less
than 200 a fully configured system which also provides incircuit emulation
hardware is priced at approximately 2000 customers moving from entrylevel
designs to those requiring realtime emulation are able to preserve their
investment in learning and tools as they migrate to future picr devices since
all systems share the same integrated development environment

     many independent companies also develop and market application development
tools and systems that support our standard microcontroller product
architecture currently there are more than 120 thirdparty tool suppliers
worldwide whose products support our proprietary microcontroller architecture

     we believe that familiarity with and adoption of our and thirdparty
development systems by an increasing number of product designers will be an
important factor in the future selection of our embedded control products these

manufacturing

     the ownership of our manufacturing resources is an important component of
our business strategy enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing
control and to be one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control
industry by owning our wafer fabrication and the majority of our test
operations and by employing proprietary statistical process control techniques
we have been able to achieve high production yields direct control over
manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles
this control also allows us to capture the wafer manufacturing and a portion of
the assembly and testing profit margin

     we perform product packaging and testing at our facilities located near
bangkok thailand we also use thirdparty assembly and test contractors in
several asian countries

     wafers are produced in class 10 fabrication modules in fab 1 and fab 2 fab
1 currently contains approximately 40000 square feet of usable clean room space
and currently produces 6inch wafers fab 2 currently contains approximately
50000 square feet of usable clean room space and currently produces 8inch
wafers wafer sort is performed in an 8000 square foot class 10000 clean
room equipped with automated wafer handlers and test equipment fabs 1 and 2
are managed by the same management team and utilize similar production
techniques fab 3 contains approximately 114000 square feet of clean room space
and when required for production will produce 8inch wafers

     by march 31 2001 we reduced cumulative capacity at fabs 1 and 2 by
approximately 24 compared to our capacity at december 31 2000 in response to
business conditions that resulted in decreased product demand during fiscal
2002 fabs 1 and 2 operated at approximately 70 of their capacity due to the
capacity reductions implemented in the march 2001 quarter and a oneweek plant
shutdown in each quarter of fiscal 2002 operating at lower percentages of
capacity has a negative impact on operating results as certain fixed operating
costs are expensed

     fab 3 is currently being maintained at minimal operating cost until we
expect to require its capacity for production we currently plan to utilize fab
3 for our future production requirements however as we begin to plan for the
mobilization of fab 3 we continue to explore other potentially more
costeffective alternatives that may become available to meet our future
production requirements

     fabs 1 and 2 currently utilize various manufacturing process technologies
but predominantly utilize our 10 to 05 micron processes we continue to
transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future
manufacturing costs we also continue to increase the percentage of our
production on 8inch wafers as of march 31 2002 8inch wafers accounted for
approximately 80 of our production we believe that our successful transition
to more advanced process technologies is important for us to remain competitive
our future operating results could be adversely affected if any such transition
is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented

     the foregoing statements related to our continuing exploration of
alternatives to meet our future production requirements and the transition to
more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs are
forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially because of
the following factors among others increased or decreased customer demand for
our products the availability of equipment and other supplies supply
disruption fluctuations in production yields production efficiencies and
overall capacity utilization absorption of fixed costs labor and other direct
manufacturing costs changes in product mix and other economic conditions

     we currently employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in
developing our microcontroller and memory products we believe our processes
afford us both costeffective designs in existing and derivative products and
greater functionality in new product designs while many of our competitors
develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product
lines we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and
nonvolatile memory products this allows us to more fully absorb our process
research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more
rapidly our engineers utilize advanced cad tools and software to perform
circuit design simulation and layout and our inhouse photomask and wafer
fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by
processing test wafers quickly and efficiently

     at march 31 2002 approximately 53 of our assembly requirements were
being performed in our thailand facility thirdparty contractors located
throughout asia perform the balance of our assembly operations our 200000
square foot thailand facility currently tests substantially all of the products
produced in fabs 1 and 2 and also tested substantially all such products at
march 31 2002 during fiscal 2003 we will construct an approximately 67000
square foot expansion of test capacity at our thailand facility that once
completed will increase the facilitys test capacity by up to 70 the
expansion is currently scheduled to be completed by february 2003 see item 2 
properties below at page 15

                                       5
page
     the foregoing statement related to the expected completion date of the
expansion of test capacity at our thailand facility is a forward looking
statement actual results could differ materially because of the following
factors among others delays in construction and equipment installation of the
additional test capacity the availability of equipment and other supplies
supply disruption labor unrest political instability and expropriation and
other general economic conditions

     we also contract with thirdparty wafer foundries to fabricate
approximately 40 of our analog products we expect that by the end of fiscal
2003 approximately 20 of our analog products will be fabricated by third
parties on a strategic basis we will use thirdparty foundries to shorten our
product design cycle on certain key technologies and products

     the foregoing statement related to the amount of analog products being
fabricated by third parties at the end of fiscal 2003 is a forwardlooking
statement actual results could differ materially because of the following
factors among others increased or decreased customer demand for our analog
products difficulties transitioning products from thirdparty foundries to our
manufacturing processes and technologies fluctuations in production yields
production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization changes in product
mix competitive pressures on prices and other economic conditions

     our reliance on third parties involves some reduction in our level of
control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review
the quality delivery and cost performance of these thirdparty contractors our
future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to
maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at
approximately their current levels

     our reliance on foreign operations maintenance of substantially all of our
finished goods in inventory in foreign locations and significant foreign sales
exposes us to foreign political and economic risks to date we have not
experienced any significant interruptions in our foreign business operations if
any significant interruption in our foreign business operations materializes
our sales could decrease and our performance could suffer

     due to the high fixed costs inherent in semiconductor manufacturing
consistently high manufacturing yields can have significant positive effects on
gross profit and overall operating results during fiscal 2002 we continued to
focus on manufacturing productivity and maintained average wafer fab line
yields in excess of 95 our manufacturing yields are primarily driven by a
comprehensive implementation of statistical process control extensive employee
training and selective upgrading of our manufacturing facilities and equipment
maintenance of manufacturing productivity and yields are important factors in
the achievement of our operating results the manufacture and assembly of
integrated circuits particularly nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic
devices such as those that we produce are complex processes these processes
are sensitive to a wide variety of factors including the level of contaminants
in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and the
performance of our wafer fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in
the semiconductor industry we have from time to time experienced lower than
anticipated manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are
unable to maintain yields at approximately the current levels

     our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and
equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one
source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers
capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our
standards in addition the raw materials and equipment necessary for our
business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of
semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply
shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told
us they need more time than expected to fill our orders an interruption of any
raw materials or equipment sources could harm our business

research and development

     we are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products
including development systems and in our design and manufacturing process
technologies we believe these investments are significant factors in
maintaining our competitive position our current research and development or
rd activities focus on the design of new microcontroller 16bit digital
signal controller memory and mixedsignal products assps new development
systems and software and applicationspecific software libraries we are also
developing new design and process technology to achieve further cost reductions
and performance improvements in existing products in fiscal 2002 our rd
expenses were 817 million compared to 786 million in fiscal 2001 and 524
million in fiscal 2000

sales and distribution

     we market our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct
sales personnel and electronics distributors from time to time we expect that
we may restructure certain portions of our sales network as we deem appropriate
given the level of our business

     our direct sales force focuses primarily on major strategic accounts in
three geographical markets the americas europe and asia we currently maintain
sales and support centers in major metropolitan areas in north america europe
and asia we believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to
the continued development of the embedded control market the majority of our
field sales engineers referred to as fses field application engineers
referred to as faes and sales management have technical degrees and have been
previously employed in an engineering environment we believe that the technical
knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our
products currently we strive to have at least one dedicated fae in every sales
and support center the primary mission of our fae team is to provide technical
assistance to strategic accounts and to conduct periodic training sessions for
fses and distributor sales teams faes also frequently conduct technical
seminars in major cities around the world and work closely with our
distributors to provide technical assistance and enduser support

     distributors focus primarily on servicing the product and technical support
requirements of our broad base of small and mediumsized customers we believe
that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad customer
base

     in fiscal 2002 we derived 62 of our net sales from sales through
distributors and 35 of our net sales from direct sales to original equipment
manufacturers referred to as oem customers distributors accounted for 65 of
our net sales in fiscal 2001 and 63 of our net sales in fiscal 2000 one
distributor accounted for 13 of our total net sales for fiscal 2002 14 for
fiscal 2001 and 14 for fiscal 2000 no other distributor or end customer
accounted for more than 10 of our net sales in fiscal years 2002 2001 or 2000

     generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and
our distributors may terminate their relationship with us with little or no
advanced notice the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more
of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and
could result in an increase in inventory returns

     as is common in the semiconductor industry we provide limited price
protection to our distributors under our current policy distributors receive a
credit for the difference at the time of a price reduction between the price
they were originally charged for products in inventory and the reduced price
that we subsequently charge distributors from time to time and on a
casebycase basis distributors may also receive credit for specific
transactions that we approve in advance we also grant some distributors limited
rights to return products we do not recognize net sales and profit on sales to
distributors that have rights of return and price protection until those
distributors have sold the products to end customers

     foreign sales primarily in asia and europe represented 69 of our total
net sales in fiscal 2002 compared to 68 in each of fiscal 2001 and fiscal
2000 international sales are predominately billed in us dollars although
foreign sales are subject to certain government export restrictions we have not
experienced any material difficulties as a result of export restrictions to
date for a detailed description of our sales by geographic region see also
item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations  results of operations  net sales at page 20 and note
16 to our consolidated financial statements

backlog

     as of april 26 2002 our backlog was approximately 1199 million
compared to 1379 million as of april 27 2001 our backlog includes all
purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the subsequent 12 months

     we primarily produce standard products that can be shipped from inventory
within a short time after we receive an order our business and to a large
extent that of the entire semiconductor industry is characterized by
shortterm orders and shipment schedules orders constituting our current
backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the
customers option without significant penalty thus while backlog is useful for
scheduling production backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable
measure of sales for any future period orders received in a quarter for
shipment in that quarter which we refer to as turns orders are an important
component of our quarterly operating results see additional factors that may
affect results of operations beginning below at page 10

competition

     the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been
characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with
major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have
greater market recognition and greater financial technical marketing
distribution and other resources than we with which to pursue engineering
manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products emerging companies
may also increase their participation in the market for embedded control
applications furthermore capacity in the semiconductor industry is increasing
over time and such increased capacity or improved product availability could
adversely affect our competitive position

     we currently compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation
and performance of our embedded control products including such products

         speed                             reliability
         functionality                     packaging alternatives
         density                           price
         power consumption                 availability

we believe that other important competitive factors in the embedded control
market include

         ease of use
         functionality of application development systems and
         technical service and support

     we believe that we compete favorably with other companies on all of these
factors but we may be unable to compete successfully in the future which could
harm our business

patents licenses and trademarks

     as of march 31 2002 we owned 197 us patents and 78 foreign patents
expiring on various dates between 2003 and 2021 and had an additional 140 us
patent applications and 146 foreign patent applications pending we intend to
continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing processes the
process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and patents may
not be issued from currently pending or future applications in addition our
existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of sufficient
scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage
to us we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the us
patent and trademark office which can require significant financial and
management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do not
protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the
united states we believe however that our continued success depends primarily
on such factors as the technological skills and innovative abilities of our
personnel rather than on our patents

     we have entered into certain intellectual property licenses and
crosslicenses with other companies related to semiconductor products and
manufacturing processes as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our
customers have from time to time received and may in the future receive
communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual
property rights on certain of our products or technologies we investigate all
such notices and respond as we believe is appropriate based on industry
practice we believe that in most cases we can obtain any necessary licenses or
other rights on commercially reasonable terms but we cannot assure that
licenses would be on acceptable terms that litigation would not ensue or that
damages for any past infringement would not be assessed litigation which could
result in substantial cost to us and divert management effort may be necessary
to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us
against claimed infringement of the rights of others the failure to obtain
necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement
claims could harm our business see item 3  legal proceedings beginning
below at page 16

environmental regulation

     we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental
regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic
volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes
including the resource conservation and recovery act the comprehensive
environmental response compensation and liability act the superfund amendment
and reauthorization act the clean air act and the water pollution control act
we believe that we have obtained all of the environmental permits required to
conduct our business although we believe that our activities conform to
presently applicable environmental regulations our failure to comply with
present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines
suspension of production or a cessation of operations any such regulation could
require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to
comply with environmental regulations while we have not experienced any
materially adverse effects on our operations from governmental regulations any
failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of
hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities environmental
problems may occur that could subject us to future costs or liabilities

employees

     as of april 26 2002 we had 3041 employees worldwide including 1957 in
manufacturing 540 in rd 397 in sales and marketing and 147 in finance and
administration approximately 41 of our employees work at our thailand
facility no employees in the us or thailand are represented by a labor
organization we have never had a work stoppage and believe that our employee
relations are good

additional factors that may affect results of operations

     when evaluating microchip and its business you should give careful
consideration to the factors listed below in addition to the information
provided elsewhere in this form 10k and in other documents that we file with
the securities and exchange commission

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors that could reduce
our net sales and profitability

     our quarterly operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors
that could reduce our net sales and profitability many of which are beyond our
control some of the factors that may affect our operating results include

         demand for our products in the distribution and oem channels
         the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter
          turns orders
         market acceptance of both our products and our customers products
         customer order patterns and seasonality
         possible disruption in commercial activities or international
          transport or delivery caused by terrorist activity armed conflict or
          unexpected increases in the price or supply of oil which could result
          in changes in logistics and security arrangements and reduced
          customer purchases relative to expectations
         impact of events outside of the united states such as the business
          impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political
          instability
         disruption in the supply of wafers or assembly and testing services
         availability of manufacturing capacity the extent of effective use of
          manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields
         the availability and cost of raw materials equipment and other
          supplies and
         economic political and other conditions in the worldwide markets
          served by us

     we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results are
not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely upon any such
comparisons as indications of future performance in future periods our
operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors which would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common
stock

our operating results will suffer if we ineffectively utilize our manufacturing
capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields

     the manufacture and assembly of integrated circuits particularly
nonvolatile erasable cmos memory and logic devices such as those that we
produce are complex processes these processes are sensitive to a wide variety
of factors including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing
environment impurities in the materials used and the performance of our wafer
fabrication personnel and equipment as is typical in the semiconductor
industry we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated
manufacturing yields our operating results will suffer if we are unable to
maintain yields at approximately the current levels

     our operating results are also adversely affected when we operate at less
than 100 capacity as was the case throughout fiscal 2002 lower capacity
utilization results in certain costs being charged directly to expense and lower
gross margins

we depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and
therefore have limited visibility of future product shipments

     our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders
received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as
turns orders and shipments from backlog we emphasize our ability to respond
quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in
customers placing orders with short delivery schedules the percentage of turns
orders in any given quarter is dependent on overall semiconductor industry
conditions and product lead times shorter lead times have the effect of
increasing turns orders as a percentage of our business in any given quarter and
reducing our visibility on future product shipments as such our percentage of
turns orders has fluctuated over the last three fiscal years between
approximately 20 and 60 as of april 1 2002 we required turns orders of
approximately 57 in order to achieve our revenue target for the first quarter
of fiscal 2003 because turns orders are difficult to predict increased levels
of turns orders make our net sales more difficult to forecast

                                       10
page
     if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular
quarter relative to our projections our revenue and operating results will
suffer

intense competition in our markets may lead to reduced sales of our products and
reduced market share

     the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been
characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change we compete with
major domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have
greater market recognition and substantially greater financial technical
marketing distribution and other resources than we with which to pursue
engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products
emerging companies are also increasing their participation in the market for
embedded control applications we may be unable to compete successfully in the
future which could harm our business

     our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both
within and outside our control including

         the quality performance reliability features ease of use pricing
          and diversity of our products
         the quality of our customer services and our ability to address the
          needs of our customers
         our success in designing and manufacturing new products including
          those implementing new technologies
         manufacturing capacity utilization and manufacturing yields
         hiring and retention of qualified engineering and management personnel
         adequate supplies of raw materials and other supplies at acceptable
          prices
         the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their own
          products
         product introductions by our competitors
         the number nature and success of our competitors in a given market
         general market and economic conditions and
         protection of our products and processes by effective utilization of
          intellectual property laws

     historically average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease
over the life of any particular product the overall average selling prices of
our microcontroller and proprietary analog and interface products have remained
relatively constant while average selling prices of our serial eeprom and
nonproprietary analog and interface products have declined over time we have
experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure in certain
of our proprietary product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we
have been able to moderate average selling price declines in many of our
proprietary products by continuing to introduce new products with more features
and higher prices we experienced significant competitive pricing pressures in
our serial eeprom product lines during the first half of fiscal 2002 which
moderated in the third and fourth quarters

     we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller
or other products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which
would reduce our operating results

we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition
for qualified personnel is intense in our market

     our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities
of our senior management engineering and other personnel the competition for
qualified engineering and management personnel is intense we may be
unsuccessful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and
retaining additional key personnel that we require the loss of the services of
one or more of our key personnel or the inability to add key personnel could
harm our business we have no employment agreements with any member of our
senior management team

                                       11
page
our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis

     our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our
ability to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that can compete
effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer
requirements the success of new product introductions depends on various
factors including

         proper new product selection
         timely completion and introduction of new product designs
         development of support tools and collateral literature that make
          complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use and
         market acceptance of our customers end products

     because our products are complex we have experienced delays from time to
time in completing development of new products in addition our new products
may not receive or maintain substantial market acceptance we may be unable to
design develop and introduce competitive products on a timely basis which
could reduce our future operating results

     our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new
design and process technologies semiconductor design and process technologies
are subject to rapid technological change and require significant rd
expenditures we and other companies in the industry have from time to time
experienced difficulties in effecting transitions to advanced process
technologies and consequently have suffered reduced manufacturing yields or
delays in product deliveries our future operating results could be adversely
affected if any transition to future process technologies is substantially
delayed or inefficiently implemented

we are dependent on several thirdparty contractors in asia to perform key
manufacturing functions for us

     we depend on several thirdparty contractors located throughout asia for a
portion of the assembly and testing of our products and for a portion of the
wafer fabrication of our analog products although we seek to reduce our
dependence on these thirdparty contractors disruption or termination of any of
these sources could harm our business and operating results our reliance on
third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions
of our business that we subcontract our future operating results could suffer
if any thirdparty contractor were to experience financial operations or
production difficulties or if they were unable to maintain manufacturing
yields assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current
levels

we may lose sales if our suppliers of raw materials and equipment fail to meet
our needs

     our semiconductor manufacturing operations require raw materials and
equipment that must meet exacting standards we generally have more than one
source for these supplies but there are only a limited number of suppliers
capable of delivering various raw materials and equipment that meet our
standards in addition the raw materials and equipment necessary for our
business could become more difficult to obtain as worldwide use of
semiconductors in product applications increases we have experienced supply
shortages from time to time in the past and on occasion our suppliers have told
us they need more time than expected to fill our orders an interruption of any
raw materials or equipment sources could harm our business

our business is highly dependent on selling through distributors

     sales through distributors accounted for 62 of our net sales for the
fiscal year ended march 31 2002 sales through one distributor accounted for
13 of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended march 31 2002 generally
we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and our distributors
may terminate their relationship with us with little or no advanced notice

     the loss of or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our
distributors could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in
an increase in inventory returns

our operating results may be impacted by the wide fluctuations of supply and
demand in the semiconductor industry

     the semiconductor industry is characterized by wide fluctuations of supply
and demand over the last 18 months the industry has experienced a significant
economic downturn characterized by diminished product demand and production

                                       12

overcapacity we have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry
cyclicality by selling proprietary products that cannot be easily or quickly
replaced to a geographically diverse base of customers across a broad range of
market segments however we have experienced substantial periodtoperiod
fluctuations in operating results and may in the future experience
periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or
economic conditions

intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant
liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights

     as is typical in the semiconductor industry we and our customers have from
time to time received and may in the future receive communications from third
parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights on certain of our
products or technologies in the event a third party were to make a valid
intellectual property claim and a license or other agreement was not available
on commercially reasonable terms our operating results could be harmed we have
in the past been are currently and may in the future be involved in
litigation to defend microchip against alleged infringement of the rights of
others or to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation could result
in substantial cost to us and divert our resources an unfavorable outcome in
any such suit could harm our business financial condition or results of
operations

     our ability to obtain patents licenses and other intellectual property
rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our
success to that end we have acquired certain patents and patent licenses and
intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions and manufacturing
processes the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive
and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications in
addition our existing patents and any new patents that are issued may not be of
sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial
advantage to us we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings
in the us patent and trademark office which can require significant financial
and management resources in addition the laws of certain foreign countries do
not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of
the united states

we do not have longterm contracts with our customers

     we do not typically enter into longterm contracts with our customers and
we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers when we do
enter into customer contracts the contract is generally cancelable at the
convenience of the customer in the event of any early termination of a contract
by one of our major customers it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly
replace that revenue source which would harm our financial results

business interruptions could harm our business

     operations at any of our primary manufacturing facilities or at any of our
wafer fabrication or test and assembly subcontractors may be disrupted for
reasons beyond our control including work stoppages power loss incidents of
terrorism political instability telecommunications failure fire earthquake
floods or other natural disasters if operations at any of our facilities or by
any of our subcontractors are interrupted we may not be able to shift
production to other facilities on a timely basis if this occurs we may
experience delays in shipments of products to our customers and alternate
sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms this could result
in reduced revenues and profits and the cancellation of orders or loss of
customers in addition business interruption insurance may not be enough to
compensate us for any losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred
by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our
business

we are highly dependent on foreign sales and operations which exposes us to
foreign political and economic risks

     sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net
sales during the fiscal year ended march 31 2002 approximately 69 of our net
sales were made to foreign customers we purchase a substantial portion of our
raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers in addition we own product
assembly and testing facilities located near bangkok thailand we also use
various thirdparty contractors located throughout asia for a portion of our
assembly and testing and a portion of our analog product wafer fabrication
requirements

                                       13
page
our reliance on foreign operations maintenance of substantially all of our
finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales
exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including

         political social and economic instability
         trade restrictions and changes in tariffs
         import and export license requirements and restrictions
         difficulties in staffing and managing international operations
         employment regulations
         disruptions in international transport or delivery
         fluctuations in currency exchange rates
         difficulties in collecting receivables
         economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us and
         potentially adverse tax consequences

     if any of these risks materialize our sales could decrease and our
operating results could suffer

we are subject to stringent environmental regulation which may force us to
incur significant expenses

     we must comply with many different federal state and local governmental
regulations related to the use storage discharge and disposal of toxic
volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process
although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable
environmental regulations our failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in the imposition of fines suspension of production or
a cessation of operations any such regulation could require us to acquire
costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with
environmental regulations any failure by us to control the use of or adequately
restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future
liabilities environmental problems may occur that could subject us to future
costs or liabilities

     in 1993 telcom acquired the semiconductor manufacturing operations of
teledyne inc previously conducted at telcoms mountain view california
facility the semiconductor manufacturing operations conducted by teledyne at
the facility allegedly contaminated the soil and groundwater of the facility
and the groundwater of properties located downgradient of the facility
although telcom was indemnified by teledyne against among other things any
liabilities arising from any such contamination and although we should be able
to benefit from this indemnification as a successor to telcoms business we
cannot assure you that claims will not be made against us or that such
indemnification will be available or will provide meaningful protection at the
time any such claim is brought to the extent that we are subject to a claim
that is not covered by the indemnity from teledyne or as to which teledyne is
unable to provide indemnification our financial condition or operating results
could suffer

our failure to successfully integrate businesses products or technologies we
acquire could disrupt or harm our ongoing business

     on may 22 2002 we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to
acquire powersmart inc we have from time to time acquired and may in the
future acquire additional complementary businesses products and technologies
achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends in part upon
whether the integration of the acquired business products or technology is
accomplished efficiently and effectively in addition successful acquisitions
in the semiconductor industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other
industries because such acquisitions require among other things integration of
product offerings manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and
marketing and rd efforts these difficulties can become more challenging due to
the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations the complexities
of the technologies being integrated and the necessities of integrating
personnel with disparate business background and combining two different
corporate cultures the integration of operations following an acquisition also
requires the dedication of management resources may distract attention from the
daytoday business and may disrupt key rd marketing or sales efforts the
inability of our management to successfully integrate any future acquisition
could harm our business furthermore products acquired in connection with
acquisitions may not gain acceptance in our markets and we may not achieve the
anticipated or desired benefits of such transaction

                                       14
page
powersmart depended on thirdparty wafer manufacturers for all of its product
requirements any inability or unwillingness of powersmarts wafer suppliers to
meet these manufacturing requirements would significantly delay our ability to
produce and ship powersmart products

     while microchip has historically manufactured virtually all of its own
wafers powersmart purchased its wafers primarily from two outside foundries
each of these foundries also fabricates wafers for other semiconductor
companies including some of our competitors one of the foundries used by
powersmart is a direct competitor of ours during fiscal 2003 we expect to
continue to rely on these wafer suppliers to supply a substantial portion of the
wafers that are required to support the business that we are acquiring from
powersmart we may be unable to acquire wafers from these foundries if they
experience manufacturing failures yield shortfalls or other situations when
demand exceeds capacity or for other reasons in such case we may not be able
to qualify additional manufacturing sources for existing powersmart products on
a timely manner or at all and such arrangements if any may not be on
favorable terms to us

     although current market conditions in the semiconductor industry indicate
that there is sufficient manufacturing capacity at outside foundries a
significant increase in demand for powersmart products during fiscal 2003 could
result in wafers being in short supply and prevent us from having an adequate
supply to meet our customer requirements and meet requested delivery dates for
customers of our powersmart products

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to a variety of factors

     the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the
past and is likely to fluctuate in the future the future trading price of our
common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of
factors many of which are beyond our control including

         quarterly variations in our operating results and the operating
          results of other semiconductor companies
         actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new
          products by us or our competitors
         changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance or
          buysell recommendations
         general conditions in the semiconductor industry and
         worldwide economic and financial conditions

     in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high
technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating
performance of such companies these broad market fluctuations and other factors
may harm the market price of our common stock









item 2 properties

     our current headquarters an rd center and fab 1 are located in four
buildings totaling approximately 415000 square feet situated on a 77acre
parcel of land in chandler arizona

     a second us manufacturing site consisting of fab 2 office and warehouse
facilities and an rd center is located in three buildings totaling
approximately 379000 square feet on a 22acre parcel of land in tempe arizona

     our third us manufacturing site consisting of fab 3 office and
warehouse facilities and an rd center is located in eight buildings totaling
approximately 700000 square feet on a 92acre parcel of land in puyallup
washington we acquired this property in july 2000 we are currently maintaining
fab 3 at a minimum operating cost until we expect to require its capacity for
production we currently plan to utilize fab 3 for our future production
requirements however as we begin to plan for the mobilization of fab 3 we
continue to explore other potentially more costeffective alternatives that
may become available to meet our future production requirements

     we own the chandler tempe and puyallup facilities

     we also own a final test and assembly facility located near bangkok
thailand the thailand final test and assembly operations are housed in a
200000 square foot facility that is owned by our thailand subsidiary and are
located in the alphatechnopolis industrial park in chacherngsao thailand near
bangkok during fiscal 2003 we will construct an expansion of approximately
67000 square feet at our thailand facility the expansion is currently
scheduled to be completed by february 2003 this area will house additional test
capacity and will also be available for incremental assembly capacity the
thailand facility is situated on land to which we expect to acquire title in
accordance with an agreement between the

                                       15
page
landowner and us to date progress towards obtaining the full title has been
hampered by the condition of the thailand financial industry and general
economic conditions in thailand at this time it is not possible to estimate
when full title transfer will be completed

     to support our sales activities we lease space for 32 sales and support
centers in major metropolitan areas in the united states europe and asia as
well as three design centers one each in california switzerland and india
our aggregate monthly rental payment for our leased facilities is approximately
242000

     we currently believe that our existing facilities together with the
additional test capacity presently under construction at our thailand facility
will be adequate to meet our requirements for the next 12 months

     as conditions in the insurance market have become more difficult over the
last fiscal year our property insurance coverage levels have decreased and our
retained risk exposure from uninsured losses has increased we have not made any
material change to our operations as a result of the reduced coverage
availability and cost of coverage have generally fluctuated over time as the
insurance industry reacts to various market forces and we will consider
purchasing additional coverage if and when the availability and pricing becomes
more favorable

     the foregoing statements related to our continuing exploration of
alternatives to meet our future production requirements the expected completion
date of construction of additional test capacity at our thailand facility the
acquisition of title to the land on which the thailand facility is situated the
adequacy of existing facilities for the next 12 months and changes in insurance
coverage are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ materially
because of the following factors among others the cyclical nature of the
semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products demand for our
products the availability of equipment and other supplies fluctuations in
production yields production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization
competitive pressures on prices political instability and expropriation cost
and availability of insurance and other economic conditions see also the
factors set forth under item 1  business  additional factors that may affect
results of operations beginning at page 10 of this report




item 3 legal proceedings

     microchip technology incorporated v us philips corporation et al
district of arizona 01cv2090pgr us philips corporation v atmel
corporation et al southern district of new york 01cv9178lap on october
26 2001 we filed an action in federal district court in arizona for
declaratory relief against us philips corporation and philips electronics
north america corp requesting that the court declare among other matters that
we do not infringe philips us patent nos 4689740 and 5559502 we
initiated legal action so that a determination could be made relating to the
validity enforceability and alleged infringement of and our license to the
philips patents prior to filing suit we had engaged in good faith licensing
negotiations with philips for several years but the discussions had reached a
point of impasse when philips substantially increased its royalty demands in
response to our filing the declaratory judgment action in arizona philips filed
an action against us in federal district court in new york alleging
infringement of the 740 patent and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive
relief despite the litigation it is possible that discussions between the
parties could resume for the purpose of resolving this matter by agreement
which could include a new license on commercially reasonable terms the
litigation is in pretrial stages we intend to litigate this matter vigorously
we currently believe that the outcome of this matter will not have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
however the final outcome of this matter is inherently uncertain and should
the outcome be adverse to us we may be required to pay damages and other
expenses and may be subjected to injunctive relief the litigation even if
resolved in our favor may also result in diversion of management attention and
significant legal fees

     in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in a limited number
of legal actions both as plaintiff and defendant and could incur uninsured
liability in any one or more of them although the outcome of these actions is
not presently determinable we believe that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not harm our business litigation relating to the semiconductor
industry is not uncommon and we are and from time to time have been subject
to such litigation no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or
outcome of any such litigation in the future

     net sales

     we have one operating industry segment and engage primarily in the design
development manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products we sell our
products to distributors and oems in a broad range of market segments perform
ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no
collateral

     our net sales of 5713 million in fiscal 2002 decreased by 1445 million
or 202 over fiscal 2001 and net sales of 7157 million in fiscal 2001
increased by 1627 million or 294 over fiscal 2000 the decrease in net
sales in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 resulted primarily from slowing
demand from end markets and to a lesser extent from inventory corrections at
our customers overall semiconductor industry conditions and serial eeprom
pricing declines we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of
market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years

     our sales increases prior to fiscal 2002 can be attributed to several
factors including

         new product introductions
         strong demand for new and existing products which address our
          customers requirements and
         focused technical resources that assist our customers in successfully
          bringing their products to market

     our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our
total net sales microcontrollers and associated application development systems
accounted for approximately 78 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002
approximately 65 of our total net sales in fiscal 2001 and approximately 72 of
our total net sales in fiscal 2000 net sales of our microcontroller products
decreased approximately 4 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 the decrease
in net sales of our microcontroller products was significantly lower than the
decrease in our other product lines due to our continuing design win performance
and the overall positioning of our proprietary product offerings net sales of
our microcontroller products increased approximately 18 in fiscal 2001
compared to fiscal 2000 driven by increased end market demand our continued
design win performance and increases in our overall market share historically
average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of
any particular product the overall average selling prices of our
microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the
proprietary nature of these products we have experienced and expect to
continue to experience moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller
product lines due primarily to competitive conditions we have been able to
moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by
introducing new products with more features and higher prices

                                       21
page
     sales of our serial eeprom products accounted for approximately 14 of our
total net sales in fiscal 2002 approximately 25 of our total net sales in
fiscal 2001 and approximately 18 of our total net sales in fiscal 1999 net
sales of our serial eeprom products decreased approximately 54 in fiscal 2002
compared to fiscal 2001 driven by over supply in the market and significant
pricing pressures net sales of our serial eeprom products increased
approximately 81 in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 driven primarily by
customers real and perceived supply and demand conditions within the market
serial eeprom product pricing responds to changes in supply and demand factors
over time being more commodity than proprietary in nature during the periods
covered by this report we have experienced various serial eeprom product
pricing trends due to market conditions in fiscal 2000 serial eeprom product
pricing trends showed modest declines while in fiscal 2001 pricing actually
increased due to supply constraints however we experienced significant
competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom product lines during the
first half of fiscal 2002 returning to modest pricing declines in the second
half of fiscal 2002 we anticipate serial eeprom pricing to be flat to up 3 in
the first quarter of fiscal 2003

     sales of mixedsignal analog and interface products accounted for
approximately 7 of our total net sales in fiscal 2002 approximately 10 of our
total net sales in fiscal 2001 and approximately 11 of our total net sales in
fiscal 2000 net sales of our analog and interface products decreased
approximately 39 in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 the decrease in net
sales of our analog and interface products can be attributed to decreased
demand primarily in the telecommunications market net sales of our analog and
interface products increased approximately 17 in fiscal 2001 compared to
fiscal 2000 driven by customers real and perceived supply and demand conditions
within the market analog and interface products can be proprietary or
nonproprietary in nature currently we consider approximately 40 of our
analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature where prices are
relatively stable similar to the pricing stability of our microcontroller
products the nonproprietary portion of our analog and interface business will
experience price fluctuations driven primarily by the current supply and demand
for those products similar to the pricing pressures experienced in our serial
eeprom product lines during fiscal 2002 our analog and interface products
experienced price reductions of approximately 25 the price decreases
experienced in fiscal 2002 can be attributed to the supply and demand
environment as well as the integration of the telcom products into our pricing
structure we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface
products to increase over time

     we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller
or other products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future which
would adversely affect our operating results

     sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march 31 2002 2001 and
2000 were as follows in thousands

     our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders
received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter which we refer to as
turns orders and shipments from backlog we measure turns orders at the
beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the revenue target
that we set entering the quarter we emphasize our ability to respond quickly to
customer orders as part of our competitive strategy resulting in customers
placing orders with short delivery schedules turns orders directly correlate
with product lead times which are currently between two and four weeks
generally essentially unchanged from lead times a year ago shorter lead times
have the effect of increasing turns orders as a percentage of our business in
any given quarter and reducing our visibility on future product shipments with
current lead times between two and four weeks customers do not place orders
beyond their immediate requirements and therefore we do not currently have the
order visibility we experienced throughout fiscal 2001 the percentage of turns
orders in any given quarter is dependent on overall semiconductor industry
conditions and product lead times as such our percentage of turns orders has
fluctuated over the last three fiscal years between approximately 20 and 60
at april 1 2002 we required turns orders of approximately 57 in order to
achieve our revenue target for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 at january 1

     turns orders are difficult to predict and we may not experience the
combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in any particular quarter
that would be sufficient to achieve anticipated net sales if we do not achieve
a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter relative to our
projections our revenue and operating results will suffer

     distributors accounted for 62 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 65 of our
net sales in fiscal 2001 and 63 of our net sales in fiscal 2000 our largest
distributor accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal 2002 14
of our net sales in fiscal 2001 and 14 of our net sales in fiscal 2000
generally we do not have longterm agreements with our distributors and our
distributors may terminate their relationships with us with little or no
advanced notice the loss of or the disruption in the operations of one or
more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter
and could result in an increase in product returns at march 31 2002
distributors were maintaining an average of 24 months of inventory of our
products over the past three fiscal years the months of inventory maintained
by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 24 and 37 months we
believe that distributor inventory levels are at or near replenishment levels
and that the dollar value and average months of distributor inventory will
increase in future periods as our business returns to a pattern of growth

     our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe
which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive
communications computing consumer and industrial control products americas
sales include sales to customers in the united states canada central america
and south america sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 69 of
our net sales in fiscal 2002 and approximately 68 of our net sales in each of
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 the majority of our foreign sales are us dollar
denominated

     we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to
minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations although none of the
countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly
inflationary economy in the last five years there is no assurance that
inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we
conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the
future at march 31 2002 we had no significant foreign currency contracts
outstanding

     gross profit

     our gross profit was 2867 million in fiscal 2002 3807 million in
fiscal 2001 and 2834 million in fiscal 2000 gross profit as a percent of
sales was 502 in fiscal 2002 532 in fiscal 2001 and 513 in fiscal 2000

     the most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage in the
periods covered by this report were

         reduced levels of manufacturing capacity utilization in fiscal 2002
          compared to the previous two fiscal years
         continued cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test
          manufacturing in all periods covered by this report
         maintenance of average selling prices for our microcontroller products
          where moderate pricing pressures were significantly offset by new
          product introductions with more features and higher selling prices in
          all periods covered by this report
         significant competitive pricing pressures in serial eeprom products in
          the first half of fiscal 2002 returning to a pattern of more moderate
          prices declines in the second half of fiscal 2002 as discussed at
          page 22
         pricing increases in serial eeprom products during fiscal 2001
         modest pricing declines in serial eeprom products during fiscal 2000
         fluctuations in the product mix of microcontroller and
          analog products and related serial eeprom products as illustrated in
          the chart in net sales on page 22 and
         cost reductions associated with oneweek plant shutdowns in each of
          the first three quarters of fiscal 2002

     by march 31 2001 we reduced cumulative wafer capacity at fab 1 and fab 2
by approximately 24 compared to our december 31 2000 levels in response to
business conditions that resulted in decreased product demand during fiscal
2002 fab 1 and fab 2 operated at approximately 70 of their capacity due to the
capacity reductions implemented in the march 2001 quarter and a oneweek plant
shutdown in each quarter of fiscal 2002 beginning with the march 2001 quarter
our overall gross margins have been negatively impacted by these actions due to
the relatively high fixed costs inherent in our wafer fabrication manufacturing
which continue even at lower capacity levels we expect capacity utilization in
the first quarter of fiscal 2003 to be approximately 80 we are taking the
necessary actions to increase our capacity utilization by increasing variable
spending such as direct labor and raw materials costs and selectively placing
orders for longer lead time manufacturing equipment needed to achieve our
projected manufacturing outputs

     overall inventory levels have declined from 957 million as of march 31
2001 to 886 million as of march 31 2002 confirming that capacity was reduced
to a level aligned with market demand we maintained 110 days of inventory on
our balance sheet as of march 31 2002 compared to 114 days as of march 31
2001 the highest number of days of inventory that we had experienced for the
period covered by this report was 127 days as of september 30 2001

     fab 3 is currently being maintained at minimal operating cost until we
expect to require its capacity for production we currently plan to utilize fab
3 for our future production requirements however as we begin to plan for the
mobilization of fab 3 we continue to explore other potentially more
costeffective alternatives that may become available to meet our future
production requirements when required for production fab 3 will produce 8inch
wafers upon commencement of operations at fab 3 our operating margins could
suffer as production is brought online and depreciation on the buildings and
related equipment commences

     fabs 1 and 2 currently utilize various manufacturing process technologies
but predominantly utilize our 10 to 05micron processes we continue to
transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future
manufacturing costs in fiscal 2002 approximately 80 of our production was on
8inch wafers in fiscal 2001 products produced on 8inch wafers increased from
approximately 55 at the beginning of fiscal 2001 to approximately 80 at the
end of fiscal 2001 we anticipate that gross margins will fluctuate over time
driven primarily by the product mix of microcontroller products and related
memory products manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption wafer fab loading
levels and competitive and economic conditions

     the foregoing statements relating to our expected capacity utilization in
the first quarter of fiscal 2003 confirmation that our capacity reduction
actions have aligned capacity with market demand our continuing exploration of
alternatives to meet our future production requirements the transition to
higher yielding manufacturing processes to reduce future operating costs and the
fluctuation of gross margins over time are forwardlooking statements actual
results could differ materially because of the following factors among others
demand for our products fluctuations in production yields production
efficiencies and overall capacity utilization absorption of fixed costs labor
and other direct manufacturing costs competition and competitive pressure on
pricing possible disruption in commercial activities occasioned by terrorist
activity and armed conflict which could result in changes in logistics and
security arrangements and reduced enduser purchases relative to expectations
impact of events outside the united states such as the business impact of
fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability our ability to
increase manufacturing capacity as needed cost and availability of raw
materials changes in product mix and other industry and economic conditions

     at march 31 2002 approximately 53 of our assembly requirements were
being performed in our thailand facility compared to approximately 45 as of
march 31 2001 thirdparty contractors located throughout asia perform the
balance of our assembly operations substantially all of our test requirements
were being performed in our thailand facility as of march 31 2002 compared to
approximately 95 as of march 31 2001 we believe that the assembly and test
operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost
savings when compared to thirdparty contractor assembly and test costs as well
as increased control of these portions of the manufacturing process

     our reliance on third parties involves some reduction in our level of
control over the portions of our business that we subcontract while we review
the quality delivery and cost performance of our thirdparty contractors our
future operating results could suffer if any thirdparty contractor is unable to
maintain manufacturing yields assembly and test yields and costs at
approximately their current levels

     our reliance on foreign operations maintenance of substantially all of our
finished goods in inventory at foreign locations and significant foreign sales
exposes us to foreign political and economic risks including

         political social and economic instability
         trade restrictions and changes in tariffs
         import and export license requirements and restrictions
         difficulties in staffing and managing international operations
         employment regulations
         disruptions in international transport or delivery
         fluctuations in currency exchange rates
         difficulties in collecting receivables
         economic slowdown in the worldwide markets served by us and
         potentially adverse tax consequences

     to date we have not experienced any significant interruptions in our
foreign business operations if any of these risks materialize our sales could
decrease and our operating results could suffer

     research and development rd

     rd expenses for fiscal 2002 were 817 million or 143 of sales
compared to 786 million or 110 of sales fiscal 2001 and 524 million or
95 of sales for fiscal 2000 we are committed to continuing our investment in
new and enhanced products including development systems and in our design and
manufacturing process technologies we believe these investments are significant
factors in maintaining our competitive position we expense all rd costs as
incurred rd expenses include expenditures for labor masks prototype wafers
and expenses for the development of process technologies new packages and
software to support new products and design environments

     rd expenses increased 31 million or 39 for fiscal 2002 over fiscal
2001 rd expenses increased 262 million or 501 for fiscal 2001 over fiscal
2000 the primary reason for the dollar increase in rd costs in fiscal 2002
over fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 was increased labor and professional service
costs associated with expanding our technical resources rd expenses would have
increased more in fiscal 2002 if we had not implemented unpaid oneweek plant
shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2002

     selling general and administrative

     selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002 were 826
million or 145 of sales compared to 1026 million or 144 of sales for
fiscal 2001 and 868 million or 157 of sales for fiscal 2000 selling
general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field
sales marketing and administrative personnel advertising and promotional
expenditures and legal expenses selling general and administrative expenses
also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications
engineers who work in sales and support centers worldwide to stimulate demand by
assisting customers in the use and proper selection of our products

     selling general and administrative expenses decreased 200 million or
195 for fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 the primary reason for the dollar
decrease in selling general and administrative costs in fiscal 2002 over fiscal
2001 relate to reductions in wages bonuses and recruitment costs and unpaid
oneweek plant shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2002
selling general and administrative expenses increased 159 million or 183
for fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000 the primary reason for the dollar increase in
selling general and administrative costs in fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000 was
the labor and recruitment costs associated with expanding our employment base to
support the growth of our business

     selling general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time primarily
due to revenue and operating expense levels

fiscal 2001

     during the march 2001 quarter we implemented capacity and cost reduction
actions necessitated by the downturn in the semiconductor industry we reduced
cumulative wafer fab capacity at fabs 1 and 2 by approximately 24 compared to
our december 31 2000 levels we also decided to close our hong kong test
facility acquired as part of the telcom transaction and migrate these test
requirements to our thailand test facility the capacity reduction at fabs 1 and
2 was completed by the end of the march 2001 quarter the closure of the hong
kong facility was completed by june 30 2001 these actions resulted in a
restructuring charge of 64 million in the march 2001 quarter these actions
were undertaken to reduce both manufacturing capacity and manufacturing costs
the reduction in wafer fab capacity was required due to reduced customer demand
the closure of the hong kong facility was undertaken to rationalize our test
manufacturing capacity and migrate the test requirements to our more
costeffective test facility in thailand

                                       26

     included in the restructuring charges resulting from these actions was

         40 million related to equipment that was written off
         21 million related to employee severance costs and
         03 million related to other restructuring costs

     on january 16 2001 we completed our merger with telcom under the terms
of the merger agreement we exchanged each share of telcom common stock for
0795 of a share of microchip common stock we issued 14702184 shares of our
common stock and assumed all outstanding telcom stock options the transaction
was structured as a taxfree reorganization and is being accounted for as a
poolingofinterests

     during the march 2001 quarter we recognized a special charge of 109
million for costs associated with the telcom transaction these costs included

         73 million associated with investment banking fees
         16 million associated with legal and accounting fees
         09 million of severance costs and
         11 million related to other costs

     all reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal 2001 actions
have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously provided
amounts

fiscal 2000

     telcom recorded restructuring charges in its quarter ended march 31 1999
of 03 million primarily for employee severance costs these charges have been
reflected in our fiscal 2000 operating results all restructuring reserves
relating to these charges have been fully utilized

     legal settlement with lucent technologies inc

     on january 13 1998 we finalized a settlement of patent litigation with
lucent technologies inc resulting in a 5000000 special charge during the
quarter ended december 31 1997 under the terms of the settlement we made
onetime cash payment to lucent and issued to lucent a warrant to acquire
1012500 shares of our common stock at 748 per share we originally assigned
a value of 33 million to the warrant and recorded the amount in accrued
liabilities the warrant was exercised by the holder in fiscal 2002 and the
33 million was reclassified to additional paidin capital and is now reflected
in our statement of stockholders equity and other comprehensive income the
terms of the settlement also provided for a contingent payment to lucent if our
earnings per share performance for the three and onehalf year period ended june
30 2001 did not meet certain targeted levels based on the estimate of earnings
per share for the measurement period as of march 31 1999 we provided
appropriate reserves to meet this liability due to the sale of the warrant by
the holder to a third party the associated reserve became unnecessary and 36
million of the special charge was reversed in the quarter ended september 30
1999

     we also recorded a special charge related to other legal issues in the
amount of 12 million in the quarter ended september 30 1999

     additionally we recorded a special charge related to other legal issues in
the amount of 12 million in the quarter ended september 30 1999

     all reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal 2000 actions
have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously provided
amounts

                                       27
page
     other income expense

     interest income in fiscal 2002 decreased from interest income in fiscal
2001 although average invested cash balances were higher in fiscal 2002 the
decrease in interest income was primarily driven by significantly lower interest
rates applicable to our invested cash balances during fiscal 2002 compared to
the interest rates applied during fiscal 2001 interest income in fiscal 2001
increased from fiscal 2000 as a result of higher invested cash balances due
primarily to the receipt of proceeds of 1140 million from followon public
offerings completed in march 2000

     provision for income taxes

     provisions for income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and
state tax on us earnings our effective tax rate was 255 in fiscal 2002
272 in fiscal 2001 and 255 in fiscal 2000 and is lower than statutory rates
in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations
and rd tax credits the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 was
primarily related to increased rd tax credits that were available to us based
on our current assumptions we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal
2003 will be approximately 255

     the foregoing statement regarding our anticipated effective tax rate for
fiscal 2003 is a forwardlooking statement actual results could differ
materially because of the following factors among others current tax laws and
regulations taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant
operations the portion of total income generated in each taxing jurisdiction
and current tax holidays available in foreign locations

euro conversion issues

     we operate in the european market and currently generate approximately
onethird of our total net sales from customers located in europe our
commercial headquarters in europe are located in the united kingdom which is
not currently one of the 11 member states of the european union that has
converted to the euro

     we currently conduct approximately 977 of our business in europe in us
dollars and approximately 21 of our business in europe in pounds sterling the
balance of our net sales in europe is conducted in the euro we will monitor the
potential commercial impact of conversion of a portion of our current business
to the euro but we do not currently anticipate any material impact to our
business or operations based on this transition

     the foregoing statement regarding the anticipated impact of the transition
to the euro currency is a forwardlooking statement actual results could differ
materially because of the following factors among others levels of sales in
europe that may be conducted in the euro and fluctuations in currency exchange
rates

liquidity and capital resources

     we had 2806 million in cash and cash equivalents at march 31 2002 an
increase of 1507 million from the march 31 2001 balance during the fiscal
year ended march 31 2002 we maintained an unsecured revolving credit facility
with a syndicate of banks totaling 1000 million we can elect to increase the
facility to 1500 million subject to certain conditions set forth in the
credit agreement this facility terminates on may 31 2003 there were no
borrowings against the line of credit as of march 31 2002 we are required to
achieve certain financial ratios and operating results to maintain this line of
credit and were in compliance with these covenants as of march 31 2002

     we also maintain an unsecured shortterm line of credit with various
financial institutions in asia totaling 200 million us dollar equivalent
there were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march 31 2002
but an allocation of 08 million of the available line was made related to
import guarantees associated with our business in thailand there are no
covenants related to the foreign line of credit

     at march 31 2002 an aggregate of 1192 million of these facilities was
available subject to financial covenants and ratios with which we were in
compliance our ability to fully utilize these facilities is dependent on our
remaining in compliance with such covenants and ratios

     net cash provided from operating activities was 1788 million for fiscal
2002 2544 million for fiscal 2001 and 2469 million for fiscal 2000 the
principal changes in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2002 was related to
decreased profitability offset by the impact of inventory valuation provisions
changes in inventories and changes in other assets and liabilities

     our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of
actual and anticipated business conditions capital expenditures were 447
million in fiscal 2002 4411 million in fiscal 2001 and 2140 million in
fiscal 2000 the primary reason for the dollar decrease in capital expenditures
from the prior year was the reduction in the level of capacity expansion
activities in response to reduced demand capital expenditures were primarily
for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and
development equipment in each of these periods we currently intend to spend
approximately 1500 million during the next 12 months to invest in equipment to
maintain and increase capacity at our existing wafer fabrication and product
assembly and test facilities

     we expect to finance capital expenditures through our cash flows from
operations and available debt arrangements we believe that the capital
expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide
sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs

     the foregoing statements regarding the anticipated level of capital
expenditures over the next 12 months and the financing of such capital
expenditures are forwardlooking statements actual results could differ
materially because of the following factors among others the cyclical nature
of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products market
acceptance of our products and of our customers products demand for our
products utilization of current manufacturing capacity the availability and
cost of raw materials equipment and other supplies and economic political and
other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us

     net cash provided by financing activities was 161 million for fiscal
2002 1095 million for fiscal 2001 and 1234 for fiscal 2000 proceeds from
the sale of stock and put options were 438 million for fiscal 2002 1185
million for fiscal 2001 and 1512 million for fiscal 2000 payments on long

     during fiscal 2002 we made a net delivery of 572645 shares of our common
stock we also received approximately 141 million in connection with an early
termination covering 1650000 of the shares outstanding under the net shares
settled forward contract we closed out the net shares settled forward contract
in its entirety on january 15 2002 and made a cash payment of 278 million to
purchase the remaining 1610606 shares of our common stock outstanding under
the contract the purchased shares were held as treasury shares and were used to
fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan
through april 9 2002

     we had no off balance sheet financings at march 31 2002

                                       29
page
     at march 31 2002 we had contractual obligations of approximately 363
million for the purchase or construction of property plant and equipment

     on may 22 2002 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire powersmart
inc we will pay approximately 540 million in cash for powersmart and will
assume a balance sheet with approximately 40 million in cash and other net
assets the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and will be funded
by our existing cash balances the transaction is expected to close by june 7
2002 following approval by powersmarts stockholders

     we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated
cash requirements for at least the next 12 months however the semiconductor
industry is capital intensive in order to remain competitive we must
constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital
equipment for both production and research and development we may seek
additional equity or debt financing during the next 12 months for the capital
expenditures required to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product
assembly and test facilities investments in or acquisitions of complimentary
businesses products or technologies or other purposes the timing and amount of
any such capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including
demand for our products changes in industry conditions product mix and
competitive factors there can be no assurance that such financing will be
available on acceptable terms and any additional equity financing could result
in incremental dilution to existing investors

critical accounting policies and estimates

     general

     our discussion and analysis of microchips financial condition and results
of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting
our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our
estimates including those related to revenue recognition allowance for
doubtful accounts inventories income taxes property plant and equipment and
litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results
may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from
those on which we based our assumptions we review these estimates and judgments
on an ongoing basis we believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements

     revenue recognition

     we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems and to
distributors who have no or limited product return rights and no price
protection rights for sales recorded upon shipment we record reserves to cover
the estimated customer returns returns have historically been less than 15 of
sales to the extent rates of return change our estimates for the reserves
necessary to cover such returns would also change when distributors have broad
rights to return products and price protection rights we defer revenue
recognition until the distributor sells the product to the end customer upon
shipment amounts billed to distributors with broad rights to return product and
price protection rights are included as accounts receivable inventory is
relieved the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current
liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their customers

     allowance for doubtful accounts

     we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which
is included in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by
regularly reviewing the composition of our accounts receivable aging and
evaluating individual customer receivables considering such customers
financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the
financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be
required writeoffs of customer account balances have ranged between 03
million and 06 million annually during the periods covered by this report

                                       30
page
     inventories

     inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin
firstout fifo method we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence
or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost
of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable
than those we projected additional inventory writedowns may be required
inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and
charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later
suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating our
reserves for obsolescence we generally evaluate estimates of demand over a
12month period and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the
estimated 12month demand

     income taxes

     as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
which we operate this process involves estimating our actual current tax
exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in
deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated
balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction
and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a
valuation allowance we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we
believe that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of
our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax
asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made at
march 31 2002 our gross deferred tax asset was 840 million numerous taxing
authorities in the countries in which we do business are increasing their
scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses we believe that we
maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may
arise upon audit in these countries if such amounts ultimately prove to be
unnecessary the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax
benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed
necessary if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate
assessment a future charge to expense would result

     the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax
asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forwardlooking statements
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors among
others results of any audit conducted by the various taxing authorities in the
countries in which we do business the level of our taxable income and whether
our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset current
and future tax laws and regulations and taxation rates in geographic regions
where we have significant operations

     property plant  equipment

     property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and
improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed when
incurred at march 31 2002 the carrying value of our property and equipment
totaled 7160 million which represents 561 of total assets this carrying
value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting
policies which incorporate estimates assumptions and judgements relative to
the useful lives of our property and equipment depreciation is provided on a
straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which
range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately 25
years on buildings we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such
assets may be impaired asset impairment evaluations are by nature highly
subjective

     fab 3 has not been placed in service and the related depreciation of the
assets at the facility has not commenced the lives to be used for depreciating
the equipment at fab 3 will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed
in service we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has
impaired the estimated life or values of the underlying assets

     the estimates assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our
property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and
expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations the use of
different estimates assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our
property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and
operations would likely result in materially different carrying values of
assets and results of operations

                                       31
page
     we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility
resides the land is subject to a complex restructuring situation relating to
the seller of the land we have provided reserves that we estimate will be
adequate to obtain full title such reserves are set at the estimated fair value
of the land however timing of the resolution and the ultimate amount to be
paid could change

     litigation

     our current estimated range of liability related to certain pending
litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of
loss and recorded reserves were not significant at march 31 2002 because of
the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining
pending litigation we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability
that could result from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes
available we will assess the potential liability related to our pending
litigation and revise our estimates revisions in our estimates of the potential
liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial
position

recently issued accounting pronouncements

     sfas 144

     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued
sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets
this statement establishes a single accounting model for longlived assets to be
disposed of by sale and resolves significant implementation issues related to
sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for
longlived assets to be disposed of and is effective for fiscal years beginning
after december 15 2001 with earlier adoption encouraged we are currently
evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 144 and have not yet determined the
effect if any such adoption would have on our results of operations or our
financial position



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     our investment portfolio consisting of fixed income securities was 2476
million as of march 31 2002 and 1301 million as of march 31 2001 these
securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk
and will decline in value if market interest rates increase if market rates
were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 from the levels of march 31
2002 and march 31 2001 the decline in the fair value of our investment
portfolio would not be material additionally we have the ability to hold our
fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect to
recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows

     we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency
rate fluctuations to date our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has
not been significant if foreign currency rates fluctuate by 15 from the rates
at march 31 2002 and march 31 2001 the effect on our financial position and
results of operation would not be material

     during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a
variety of market risks examples of which include but are not limited to
interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations as we discuss in this
item 7a and collectability of accounts receivable we continuously assess these
risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the
adverse effects of these and other potential exposures although we do not
anticipate any material losses in these risk areas no assurance can be made
that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future



item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
        financial disclosure

     following the close of fiscal 2001 our board of directors upon the
recommendation of the audit committee determined not to renew the engagement of
kpmg llp as microchips independent auditors kpmg had served as our independent
auditors for the fiscal years ended march 31 1993 through and including march

     principles of consolidation

     the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of microchip
     technology incorporated and its whollyowned subsidiaries microchip or
     the company all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
     been eliminated in consolidation

     on january 16 2001 the company merged with telcom semiconductor inc
     telcom the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests
     accordingly the consolidated financial statements have been restated to
     include the operations of telcom for all periods presented telcom had a
     december 31 fiscal year end thus the consolidated financial statements
     presented for march 31 2000 have been combined with the operations of
     telcom as of and for the year ended december 31 1999 the 2000 operations
     of telcom have been conformed to a march 31 year end thus the consolidated
     statements of cash flows and stockholders equity for march 31 2001
     include an adjustment of 3679000 which represents the net income of
     telcom for the quarter ended march 31 2000

     revenue recognition

     the company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems and
     to distributors who have no or limited product return rights and no price
     protection rights for sales recorded upon shipment the company records
     reserves for estimated customer returns when distributors have broad
     rights to return products and price protection rights the company defers
     revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to the end
     customer upon shipment amounts billed to distributors with broad rights
     to return product and price protection rights are included as accounts
     receivable inventory is relieved the sale is deferred and the gross
     margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the
     distributor to its customers

     research and development

     research and development costs are expensed as incurred research and
     development expenses include expenditures for labor masks prototype
     wafers and expenses for development of process technologies new packages
     and software to support new products and design environments

     foreign currency translation and forward contracts

     the companys foreign subsidiaries are considered to be extensions of the
     us company and any translation gains and losses related to these
     subsidiaries are included in other income and expense as the us dollar
     is utilized as the functional currency gains and losses resulting from
     foreign currency transactions transactions denominated in a currency other
     than the subsidiaries functional currency are also included in income
     gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on forward contracts
     are recorded currently in income

     income taxes

     as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements
     the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the
     jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves estimating the
     companys actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary
     differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and
     accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and
     liabilities which are included within the companys consolidated balance
     sheet the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax
     assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it
     believes that recovery is not likely it must establish a valuation
     allowance the company has not provided for a valuation allowance because
     management believes that its

                                       f7
page
     deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income should
     the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of
     its net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax
     asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

     cash and cash equivalents

     all highly liquid investments including marketable securities purchased
     with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be
     cash equivalents

     allowance for doubtful accounts

     the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
     losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required
     payments which is included in bad debt expense the company determines the
     adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the composition of its
     accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables
     considering such customers financial condition credit history and current
     economic conditions if the financial condition of the companys customers
     were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
     payments additional allowances may be required

     inventories

     inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the firstin
     firstout fifo method the company writes down its inventory for
     estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the
     difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value
     based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual
     market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company
     additional inventory writedowns may be required inventory impairment
     charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not
     subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that
     increased carrying amounts are recoverable in estimating reserves for
     obsolescence the company generally evaluates estimates of demand over a
     12month period and provides reserves for inventory on hand in excess of
     the estimated 12month demand

     property plant and equipment

     property plant and equipment are stated at cost major renewals and
     improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed
     when incurred the companys property and equipment accounting policies
     incorporate estimates assumptions and judgements relative to the useful
     lives of its property and equipment depreciation is provided on a
     straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the relative assets
     which range from three to 25 years the company evaluates the carrying
     value of its property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances
     indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired asset
     impairment evaluations are by nature highly subjective

     litigation

     the companys estimated range of liability related to certain pending
     litigation is based on claims for which it can estimate the amount and
     range of loss because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and
     range of the loss on the remaining pending litigation the company is
     unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result
     from an unfavorable outcome as additional information becomes available
     the company will assess the potential liability related to its pending
     litigation and revise its estimates such revisions in estimates of the
     potential liability could materially impact the companys results of
     operations and financial position

     impairment of longlived assets

     the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its longlived
     assets in accordance with sfas 121 accounting for the impairment of
     longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of based upon
     the estimated cash flows to be generated by the related asset the
     evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which there are
     identifiable independent cash flows

     equity derivative instruments

     the company has utilized a net share settled forward contract for the sale
     and repurchase of common stock amounts paid and proceeds received from
     this instrument are recorded as components of additional paidin capital

     stock option plans

     prior to april 1 1996 the company accounted for its stock option plans in
     accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb
     opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related
     interpretations as such compensation expense would be recorded only if
     on the date of grant the current market

                                       f8
page
     price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price and would be
     recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting period on april 1
     1996 the company adopted sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased
     compensation sfas no 123 which permits entities to recognize as
     expense over the vesting period the fair value of all stockbased awards on
     the date of grant alternatively sfas no 123 also allows entities to
     continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no 25 and provide pro
     forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee
     stock option grants made in fiscal 1996 and future years as if the
     fairvaluebased method defined in sfas no 123 had been applied the
     company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no
     25 and to provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas no 123

     use of estimates

     the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the
     reporting of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure
     of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated
     financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
     principles actual results could differ from those estimates

     sfas 133

     in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
     financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivatives and
     similar financial instruments for hedging activities to establish
     accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for
     hedging activities sfas no 133 requires that an entity recognizes all
     derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and
     measure those instruments at fair value this new standard as amended by
     related sfas nos 137 and 138 was effective for the company for its fiscal
     year ending march 31 2002 the adoption of sfas no 133 had no material
     impact on the companys results of operations

     sfas 144

     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
     144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets this
     statement establishes a single accounting model for longlived assets to be
     disposed of by sale and resolves significant implementation issues related
     to sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and
     for longlived assets to be disposed of and is effective for fiscal years
     beginning after december 15 2001 with earlier adoption encouraged the
     company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 144 and
     has not yet determined the effect if any such adoption would have on the
     companys results of operations or financial position
