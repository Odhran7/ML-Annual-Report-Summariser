industry background 

historically traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic “pv” installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems including the following 

• productivity limits  if solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter—group or “string” of modules are wired in series and an entire string’s output is limited by the output of the lowestperforming module because of its string design there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional central inverter approach 

• reli a bility issues  traditional central inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output as a result central inverters typically carry warranties of only 5 to 10 years 

• complex design and installation requirements  the central inverterbased solar pv installation requires greater effort on the part of the installer both in terms of design and onsite labor central inverter installations require string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation as well as specialized equipment such as direct current “dc” combiners conduits and disconnects in addition the use of highvoltage dc requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology 

• lack of monitoring  the majority of solar installations with central inverter technology offer limited monitoring capabilities if a module in a central inverter system fails or is not performing to specification the resulting loss of energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time 

• safety issues  central inverter solar pv installations have a wide distribution of highvoltage 600 volts to 1000 volts dc wiring if damaged dc wires can generate sustained electrical arcs reaching temperatures of more than 5000 °f this creates the risk of fire for solar pv installation owners and injury for installers and maintenance personnel 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  6 

these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

• installer  solar pv installers aim for simple installation design fast installation times and maximum system performance and predictability the installation of highvoltage dc central inverter technology however requires significant preparation precautionary safety measures timeconsuming string calculations extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment training and knowledge together these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer 

• system owner  solar power system owners aim for high energy production low cost high reliability and low maintenance requirements as well as reduced fire risks with traditional central inverters owners often are unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar pv installations due to string design limitations as such they experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions can face frequent system failures and lack the ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar pv installation in addition central inverter installations operate at highvoltage dc which bears significant fire risks further due to their large size central inverter installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building 

the solar industry is transitioning from solar only systems to complete energy management solutions which consist of solarplus storage and load control 

our products 

we design develop manufacture and sell home energy solutions that manage energy generation energy storage and control and communications on one intelligent platform we have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductorbased microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies provides advanced energy monitoring and control this is vastly different than a central inverter system using string modules with or without an optimizer approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array the enphase energy system powered by iq™ microinverters and iq™ batteries our current generation integrated solar storage and energy management offering enables selfconsumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy simplifying design and installation and improving system uptime and reliability the iq family of microinverters like all of our previous microinverters is fully compliant with nec 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements unlike string inverters this capability is builtin with no additional equipment necessary

intellectual property 

we operate in an industry in which innovation investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success we protect our technology through a variety of means including through patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements as of december 31 2021 we had 250 issued us patents 79 issued foreign patents 71 pending us patent applications and 60 pending foreign counterpart patent applications our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2022 and 2046 there are no significant patents expiring in 2022 

we have licensed certain technologies for application in hardware and software in our products such licenses are generally fullypaid royaltyfree licenses given the volume and pace of new patents worldwide it may become necessary in the future to license intellectual property on terms that are yet unknown to us and that may be less favorable than licenses in the past in addition we license open source software from various third parties for use in hardware and software such open source software is licensed under open source licenses and we take efforts to maintain compliance with such licenses 

we continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion energy storage devices and related energy environments 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter and storage manufacturing processes involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

we own or have rights to various trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries including enphase the enphase “e” iq ensemble os encharge envoy enpower and enlighten we rely on both registration of our marks as well as common law protection where available 

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans 

as part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology 

government regulations 

our business activities are global and are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations for example substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions in addition the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions changes in tax policy or trade regulations the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations compliance with these laws rules and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures and results of operations 

privacy and security laws 

there are privacy and data security laws to which we are currently subject andor may in the future be subject every us state members of the european economic area switzerland united kingdom brazil mexico australia new zealand china and many other jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted privacy and data security laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  11 

the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is wideranging in scope imposes several requirements relating to a variety of matters including the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates the information provided to the individuals the documentation we must maintain the security and confidentiality of the personal data data breach notification and the use of thirdparty processors in connection with the processing of personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the eu provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance including the potential for significant fines the gdpr requirements apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including employee information the gdpr has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to all types of personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the gdpr which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business however despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the gdpr we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control or other factors outside our control 

additionally we are governed by a california state privacy law called the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which contains requirements similar to gdpr for the handling of personal information of california residents the ccpa establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for california residents the ccpa includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action the ccpa requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers as that word is broadly defined in the ccpa and new ways for such consumers to optout of certain sales of personal information and to allow for a new cause of action for data breaches further california voters approved a new privacy law the california privacy rights act “cpra” in the november 3 2020 election effective starting on january 1 2023 the cpra will significantly modify the ccpa including by expanding the consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information the cpra also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and the cpra new legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally for example on march 2 2021 virginia enacted the virginia consumer data protection act “cdpa” which becomes effective on january 1 2023 and on june 8 2021 colorado enacted the colorado privacy act “cpa” which takes effect on july 1 2023 the cpa and cdpa are similar to the ccpa and cpra but aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear resulting in further legal uncertainty 

the gdpr ccpa cpra cpa and cdpa exemplify the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data other states in the us have passed or are considering privacy laws and additional countries have in recent years implemented new privacy laws our compliance costs and potential liability may increase with this scattered regulatory environment 

seasonality 

historically the majority of our revenues are from the north american and european regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends including weather patterns and construction cycles the first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry due to these same factors although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

government incentives 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates tax credits lower vat rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments the market for on‑grid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time thus helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utilityprovided power the disallowance or changes in government subsidies or economic incentives could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted by the scheduled phasedown of the investment tax credit for solar projects under section 48a the “itc” of the internal revenue 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  12 

code of 1986 as amended the “code” the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provided a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 which was reduced to a tax credit of 26 for any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through december 31 2022 and 22 thereafter to december 31 2023 before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning on january 1 2024 as a result several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the irs published in june 2018 allowing them to preserve the historical 30 investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after december 31 2019

risks related to our business operations and our industry 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries including the us have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs “fits” rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions where we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place furthermore electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

among other governmentestablished incentives net metering and related policies have supported the growth of ongrid solar products and changes to such policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from our solar service offerings net metering is a utility rate program that requires a consumer’s electric company to purchase the excess solar energy that the consumer’s solar panels produce and pay net surplus compensation “nsc” ie the retail rate for electricity exported to the grid less certain nonbypassable fees to the consumer for example in 2016 california’s public utilities commission “cpuc” issued an order retaining retailbased net metering credits for residential customers of californias major utilities as part of net energy metering 20 nem 20 under nem 20 new distributed generation customers receive the nsc customers under nem 20 also are subject to interconnection charges and time‑ofuse rates with different electricity prices during peak and offpeak hours existing customers who receive service under the prior net metering program as well as new customers under the nem 20 program remain eligible for the nem 20 program for a period of 20 years on september 3 2020 the cpuc opened a new proceeding to review its current net metering policies and to develop net energy metering 30 nem 30 also referred to by the cpuc as the nem 20 successor tariff and issued its draft decision on december 13 2021 while the outcome of this proceeding is uncertain it could result in a significant reduction of the nsc payments for new solar customers and introduces a monthly grid participation charge of approximately 8kw which significantly affects the economics of buying solar proceedings on distributed energy policy and utility rates before the cpuc could also result in changes that affect customers with distributed generation systems changes such as nem 30 in california or other jurisdictions could reduce demand for solar pv systems including our products and harm our business 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic our business will suffer 

our iq™ microinverter ac and iq™ battery storage systems are utilized in solar pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model under which businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 

• market acceptance of solar pv systems based on our product platform 

• cost competitiveness reliability and performance of solar pv systems compared to conventional and nonsolar renewable energy sources and products 

• availability and amount of government subsidies and incentives to support the development and deployment of solar energy solutions 

• the extent to which the electric power industry and broader energy industries are deregulated to permit broader adoption of solar electricity generation 

• the cost and availability of key raw materials and components used in the production of solar pv systems 

• prices of traditional utilityprovided energy sources 

• levels of investment by endusers of solar energy products which tend to decrease when economic growth slows and 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  16 

• the emergence continuance or success of or increased government support for other alternative energy generation technologies and products 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow demand for our customers’ products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology have recently caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of lowercost manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

further our success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and uncertain but it has caused and may continue to cause various negative effects including an inability to meet the needs of our existing or potential endcustomers due to supply chain constraints the demand for solar energy solutions may continue to decrease or at least not continue its growth relative to prepandemic periods and recent years as a result of government orders associated with the covid19 pandemic due to adverse worldwide economic and market conditions or other factors if demand for solar energy solutions decreases or does not grow demand for our customers’ products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

the solar energy industry is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy and is undergoing and subject to rapid change the solar energy industry will take several more years to develop and further mature which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and we cannot be certain that the market will grow to the size or at the rate we expect we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

we depend on limitedsource suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components and products on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components of our products such as our asics and lithiumion batteries any of the solesource and limitedsource suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues stop producing our components cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of solesource or limitedsource components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  17 

our business has been affected by is currently being adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the current impacts and evolving effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic may continue to and other actual or threatened epidemics pandemics outbreaks or public health crises may in the future adversely affect our and our customers’ results of operations and financial condition our supply chain and our business 

the global spread of covid19 and the efforts to control it have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect global supply chains any disruptions to our suppliers and manufacturers by for example worker absenteeism quarantines office and factory closures disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure or other travel or healthrelated restrictions have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business and operations for example the general constraints in the market for the semiconductors has been disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and that disruption has impacted and may in future further impact the component supply for our iq7 and iq8 products as a result of these supply chain constraints and possible disruptions we are working to expand our supplier base but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that supply chain constraints and disruptions will not continue or worsen limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or delays in production or delivery of components due to covid19related restrictions could delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished products and offerings which could adversely affect our business operations and customer relationships 

our liquidity also may be negatively impacted if sales decline significantly for an extended period due to the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic further the extent to which the ongoing covid19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto impact our business and liquidity will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be precisely predicted at this time 

the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including those that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time including the ultimate duration of the pandemic travel restrictions quarantines social distancing and business closure requirements in the us and other countries and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease it is possible that additional legislation or governmental action will be taken in response to the evolving effects of the covid19 pandemic we cannot assure you as to the ultimate content timing or effect of changes nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation or governmental action however such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could negatively affect our revenue or sales of our current and or potential future products moreover the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic remain unknown and it is possible that following the pandemic inperson interactions will remain limited which would negatively impact our sales team and our future revenues these and other potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic discussed elsewhere in this “risk factors” section as well as any future and unforeseen risks related to the pandemic not yet contemplated could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations to the extent the evolving effects of the covid19 pandemic adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section 

it is also possible that future global pandemics could also occur and also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers and our business and operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products in particular we outsource the manufacturing of our products to manufacturing partners flex and salcomp assemble and test our iq microinverter ac and iq battery storage systems and envoy products prices for such services are agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the related agreements as of december 31 2021 our related purchase obligations including amounts related to component inventory procured by our primary contract manufacturers on our behalf were approximately 4246 million the timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from our estimates due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  18 

flex also provides receiving kitting storage transportation inventory visibility and other valueadded logistics services at locations managed by flex hong kong sinbon industrial limited manufactures our custom ac cables during the fourth quarter of 2020 we qualified atl in addition to a123 as our lithiumion battery suppliers to help increase our available capacity in addition we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our products 

our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our contract manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price if any of these suppliers reduce or eliminate the supply of the components to us in the future our revenues business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 

further the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which the vast majority of our products are manufactured are located outside of the us we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the us increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers which may not be available to us on favorable terms if at all for example we have experienced a volume shortage of components and may experience in future as well an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business 

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  19 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments which would adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

we have in the past and may in the future experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in one of our contract manufacturers’ facilities due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials covid19 pandemic impacts or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the schedules requested which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages and changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity furthermore counterfeit parts in our supply chain have been and continue to be a concern since any counterfeit part can be a lower quality product which may affect our system reliability 

component shortages have required us and may continue to require us to incur expedited shipping costs to meet delivery schedules which impacts our revenue and gross profit 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of product lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension of an individual product line could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we rely primarily on distributors installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products to customers and the failure of these customers to perform at the expected level or at all would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of our operations 

we sell our solutions primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and developers of thirdparty solar finance offerings we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties as a result many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

in addition while we provide our distributors and installers with training and other programs including accreditations and certifications these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently in addition new partners may require extensive training and may take significant time and resources to achieve productivity our partners may subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations or violate laws or our policies in addition our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  20 

concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property ownership could constrain the growth and development of these partnerships or result in the termination of one or more partnerships if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted and our operating results may be harmed 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

the solar industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce products or develop alternative technologies which could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers as well as against new solutions and emerging technologies that directly compete with our business a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our solutions in the modulelevel power electronics market 

competitors in the inverter market include among others solaredge technologies inc fronius international gmbh sma solar technology ag ap systems generac tesla inc huawei technologies co ltd delta ginglong sungrow solax and other companies offering string inverters other existing or emerging companies may also begin offering alternative microinverter dctodc optimizer energy storage monitoring and other solutions that compete with our products competitors in the storage market include tesla lg chem sonnen generac panasonic byd e3dc senec schneider goal zero simpliphi and other producers of battery cells and integrated storage systems 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial marketing distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition especially in certain markets in addition some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and creating market awareness for these offerings further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices of our products in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

we also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform dctoac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our systems or sell products that compete with our systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  21 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 one customer accounted for approximately 34 of total net revenues further as of december 31 2021 amounts due from one customer represented approximately 38 of the total accounts receivable balance our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements generally do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period in addition these customers may decide to no longer use or to reduce the use of our products and services for other reasons that may be out of our control we may also be affected by events impacting our large customers that result in their decreasing their orders with us or impairing their ability to pay for our products the loss of or events affecting one or more of our large customers have had from time to time and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our energy systems including our storage solution integrated ac module iq8 tm solar microinverters and ensemble technology may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share 

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products including international acceptance of our iq8 tm microinverters and ensemble technology there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products and services will be impacted by a number of factors including 

• our ability to produce pv systems that compete favorably against other solutions on the basis of price quality reliability and performance 

• our ability to timely introduce and complete new designs and timely qualify and certify our products 

• whether installers system owners and solar financing providers will continue to adopt our systems which have a relatively limited history with respect to reliability and performance 

• whether installers system owners and solar financing providers will adopt our storage solution which is a relatively new technology with a limited history with respect to reliability and performance 

• the ability of prospective system owners to obtain longterm financing for solar pv installations based on our product platform on acceptable terms or at all 

• our ability to develop products and services that comply with local standards and regulatory requirements as well as potential incountry manufacturing requirements and 

• our ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with our customers and suppliers 

in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central or string inverters or who currently sell dctodc optimizers these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central or string inverter systems or dc optimizers which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our solutions 

our success in marketing and selling “ac module” versions of our microinverter system depends in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers 

we continue to work on variants of our microinverter systems that enable direct attachment of a microinverter to solar modules the market success of such “ac module” solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with sunpower and other solar module manufacturers to design microinverters that are compatible with and can be attached directly to solar modules we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial challenges faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules and the tariffs in the us 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  22 

our recent and planned expansion into existing and new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we currently offer solar microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets throughout the world and we intend to expand into other international markets our success in new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 

• acceptance of microinverters in markets in which they have not traditionally been used 

• our ability to compete in new product markets to which we are not accustomed 

• our ability to manage manufacturing capacity and production 

• willingness of our potential customers to incur a higher upfront capital investment than may be required for competing solutions 

• timely qualification and certification of new products 

• our ability to reduce production costs in order to price our products competitively 

• availability of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy solutions 

• accurate forecasting and effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand 

• our customer service capabilities and responsiveness and 

• timely hiring of the skilled employees and efficient execution of our project plan 

further new geographic markets and larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

• differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor safety local content recycling and consumer protection regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions 

• limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection 

• risk of change in international political or economic conditions 

• restrictions on the repatriation of earnings 

• fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 

• difficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and uk bribery act 

• potentially longer sales cycles 

• generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• higher volume requirements 

• increased customer concentrations 

• warranty expectations and product return policies and 

• cost performance and compatibility requirements 

failure to address these new markets successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these markets to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  23 

we may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing 

we are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets we have made investments in our infrastructure increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so any new product is subject to certain risks including component sourcing strategic partner selection and execution customer acceptance competition product differentiation market timing challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow if we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new product introductions these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline projected thus having a materially adverse impact on our revenue operating results and financial stability 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced our iq8 tm solar microinverters and ensemble technology we started production shipments of ensemble technology and iq8 tm microinverters to customers in north america during the second quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2021 respectively our new products are complex and require significant preparation precautionary safety measures timeconsuming string calculations extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment training and knowledge together these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer our installers may not have sufficient resources or expertise necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect which could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key personnel in areas such as engineering marketing and sales any of whom would be difficult to replace for example we are highly dependent on our president and chief executive officer badrinarayanan kothandaraman mr kothandaraman possesses technical knowledge of our business operations and strategy and he has substantial experience and contacts that help us implement our goals strategy and plan if we lose his services or if he decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us our business operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 

all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience if we are not able to continue to attract train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business the progress of our product development programs could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected to help attract retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees we use stockbased incentive awards including restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened which could harm our business and results of operations also if the value of our stock awards increases substantially this could potentially create substantial personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel in addition any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees 

additionally our ability to attract qualified personnel including senior management and key technical personnel is critical to the execution of our growth strategy competition for qualified senior management personnel and highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in all areas of our business in addition integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful our failure to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key technical personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  24 

any failure by management to properly manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our business has grown rapidly and if our business develops as currently expected we anticipate that we will continue to grow rapidly in the near future our expected rapid growth could place significant demands on our management operations systems accounting internal controls and financial resources and it may also negatively impact our ability to retain key personnel if we experience difficulties in any of these or other areas we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth any failure by management to manage our growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unsuccessful in continuing to expand our directtoconsumer sales channel by driving purchases through our website our business and results of operation could be harmed 

we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal state foreign and provincial regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the use of the internet availability of economic broadband access or other online services and increase the cost of providing our digital delivery of content and services these regulations and laws may cover taxation tariffs user privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection broadband internet access and the characteristics and quality of services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership sales use and other taxes libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations 

although we primarily sell our solutions and products directly to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators who then in turn integrate our products into complete solar pv installations for residential and commercial system owners we have recently invested significant resources in our directtoconsumer sales channel through our website and our future growth relies in part on our ability to attract consumers through this channel expanding our directtoconsumer sales model will require significant expenditures in marketing software development and infrastructure further the success of directtoconsumer sales through our website is also subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal state foreign and provincial regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce these regulations and laws may cover taxation tariffs privacy data protection pricing distribution electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection and intellectual property these laws and regulations can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell our products directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

further the expansion of our directtoconsumer channel could alienate some of our existing partners and cause a reduction in sales from these partners our existing partners may perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage based on the directtoconsumer sales offered through our website due to these and other factors conflicts in our sales channels could arise and cause our existing partners to divert resources away from the promotion and sale of our products if we are unable to successfully continue to drive traffic to and increase sales through our website our business and results of operations could be harmed

risks related to our intellectual property and technology 

we are dependent on information technology systems infrastructure and data we could be subject to breaches of our information technology systems caused by system security risks failure of our data protection cyberattacks and erroneous or nonmalicious actions or failures to act by our employees or others with authorized access to our networks which could cause significant reputational legal and financial damages 

like many companies we use and store a wide variety of confidential and proprietary information relating to our business the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation despite our implementation of security measures our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks ransomware supply chain attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks unauthorized access including impersonation of unauthorized users efforts to discover and exploit any security vulnerabilities or securities weaknesses and other similar disruptions these types of attacks have increased in general as more businesses implement remote working environments although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology and related systems and have implemented measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

the techniques used in attempted cyberattacks and intrusions are sophisticated and constantly evolving and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures although to date we have not experienced any material breaches of our systems that could have material adverse effect on our business attacks and intrusions on our systems will continue and we may experience a breach of our systems that compromises sensitive company information or customer data in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security intentional or nonmalicious breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data including our intellectual property trade secrets or personal information of our employees customers or users or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or that risks of loss or misuse of this information could occur furthermore if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to reputational damage and significant costs including to rebuild our systems modify our products and services defend litigation respond to government enforcement actions pay damages or take other remedial steps any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future 

we may also share information with contractors and thirdparty providers to conduct our business although such contractors and thirdparty providers typically implement encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data those thirdparty providers may experience a significant data security breach which may also detrimentally affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the effects of a security breach of privacy violation could be further amplified during the current covid19 pandemic in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant and theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information could require substantial expenditures to remedy further we cannot be certain that a our liability insurance will be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches cyberattacks and other related breaches b such coverage will cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any incident will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or c any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition or large deductible or coinsurance requirements could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

the software we use in providing system configuration recommendations or potential energy savings estimates to customers relies in part on third party information that may not be accurate or uptodate this may therefore generate inaccurate recommendations or estimates resulting in a loss of reputation and customer confidence 

we provide our customers online tools to help them determine proper system sizing and configurations estimates of bill savings and potential revenues resulting from executing a specific curtailment strategy these 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  26 

estimates are in turn based on a number of factors such as customer tariff structures estimated wholesale electricity prices and estimates of the reduction in electricity usage as a result of a curtailment activity if the estimates we provide prove to be significantly different from actual payments or savings received by our customers it may result in the loss of reputation andor customer confidence 

we are subject to stringent privacy laws information security policies and contractual obligations governing the use processing and transfer of personal information and any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

we are subject to a variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data in the different jurisdictions in which we operate including comprehensive regulatory systems in the us and europe california enacted the ccpa which creates individual privacy rights for california consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data the ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 and became enforceable by the california attorney general on july 1 2020 the ccpa has been amended from time to time and further a new privacy law the california privacy rights act or cpra was approved by california voters in the november 3 2020 election effective starting january 1 2023 the cpra will significantly modify the ccpa including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information the cpra also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and the cpra it remains unclear what if any further modifications will be made to the ccpa or cpra or how such legislation will be interpreted new legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally for example on march 2 2021 virginia enacted the virginia consumer data protection act “cdpa” which becomes effective on january 1 2023 and on june 8 2021 colorado enacted the colorado privacy act “cpa” which takes effect on july 1 2023 the cpa and cdpa are similar to the ccpa and cpra but aspects of these state privacy statutes remain unclear resulting in further legal uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply complying with the gdpr ccpa cpra cdpa cpa or other laws regulations amendments to or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations and contractual or other obligations relating to privacy data protection data transfers data localization or information security may require us to make changes to our services to enable us or our customers to meet new legal requirements incur substantial operational costs modify our data practices and policies and restrict our business operations certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations and all 50 states have laws including obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals state officers and others any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws regulations or other obligations may lead to significant fines penalties regulatory investigations lawsuits significant costs for remediation damage to our reputation or other liabilities 

in may 25 2018 the european union “eu” implemented the gdpr a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current eu data protection law to noneu entities that process or control the processing of the personal information of eu subjects 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  27 

the gdpr imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including for example more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime shortened timelines for data breach notifications limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to special categories of data such as health data and additional obligations when we contract with thirdparty processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu and the eea to the united states and other third countries in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union issued a decision that struck down the euus privacy shield framework which provided companies with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the eu to the united states and additionally called into question the validity of the european commission’s standard contractual clauses on which us companies rely to transfer personal data from europe to the united states and elsewhere if we or our vendors fail to comply with the gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu or eea member states or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with these laws it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties 

further following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu and the eea and the expiry of the transition period companies have to comply with both the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom national law the data protection act of 2018 the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover on june 28 2021 the european commission announced a decision of “adequacy” concluding that the uk ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the gdpr which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the eea to the uk some uncertainty remains however as this adequacy determination must be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim we cannot fully predict how the data protection act the uk gdpr and other uk data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term nor the effects of divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated 

compliance with us and international data protection laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business our and our collaborators’ and contractors’ failure to fully comply with gdpr the ccpa and other laws could lead to significant fines and require onerous corrective action in addition data security breaches experienced by us our collaborators or contractors could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property public disclosure of sensitive commercial data and the exposure of personally identifiable information including sensitive personal information of our employees customers collaborators and others compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and timeintensive process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules furthermore the laws are not consistent and compliance with various different requirements may be costly if we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information was to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the us and in other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade secrets copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business 

we may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business in addition our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our installers and enduser customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems is dependent on cloudbased hosting services along with the availability of wifi or mobile data services at enduser premises despite testing by us real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our customer solutions software or technology or the technology or software we license from third parties including open source software may not be found until our customers use our products real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in negative publicity loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products harm to our brand weakening of our competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them a disruption infiltration or failure of our information technology systems thirdparty cloud hosting platforms or enduser data services as a result of software or hardware malfunctions system implementations or upgrades computer viruses cyberattacks thirdparty security breaches employeehuman error theft or misuse malfeasance power disruptions natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security failure of our enlighten service loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner customer and employee personal data we have been and may in the future be subject to fraud attempts from outside parties through our electronic systems such as “phishing” email communications to our finance technical or other personnel which could put us at risk for harm from fraud theft or other loss if our internal controls do not operate as intended any such future events could further harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  29 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against our competitors we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe upon any intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the us and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent applications an adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

• obtain from a thirdparty claiming infringement a license to sell or use the relevant technology which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 

• stop manufacturing selling incorporating or using products that embody the asserted intellectual property 

• pay substantial monetary damages 

• indemnify our customers under some of our customer contracts or 

• expend significant resources to redesign the products that use the infringing technology or to develop or acquire noninfringing technology 

any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

we have licensed and in the future we may choose or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development and marketing of our products we cannot assure you that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost 

further such licenses may be nonexclusive which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property the licensing or acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive area and other established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size capital resources or greater development or commercialization capabilities in addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us we could encounter delays and incur significant costs in product or service introductions while we attempt to develop alternative products or services or redesign our products or services to avoid infringing third party patents or proprietary rights failure to obtain any such licenses or to develop a workaround could prevent us from commercializing products or services and the prohibition of sale or the threat of the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could materially affect our business and our ability to gain market acceptance for our products or services 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  30 

in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software further companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging their use of open source software and compliance with open source license terms as a result we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code there is little legal precedent in this area and any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could harm our business and could help third parties including our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours any of the above could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we may not be able to protect and enforce our trademarks and trade names or build name recognition in our markets of interest thereby harming our competitive position 

the registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names that we own may be challenged infringed circumvented declared generic lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks we may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names which we need in order to build name recognition in addition third parties have filed and may in the future file for registration of trademarks similar or identical to our trademarks thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion if they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks and if we are not successful in challenging such rights we may not be able to use these trademarks to develop brand recognition of our technologies products or services in addition there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names if third parties succeed they succeed in registering such trademarks in the us or other countries and if we are not successful in challenging such third party rights we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products and technologies such countries if we do not secure registrations for our trademarks we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names we may not be able to compete effectively which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and over the longterm if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks then our marketing abilities may be materially adversely impacted 

obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various required procedures document submissions fee payments and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements 

periodic maintenance fees renewal fees annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents andor applications will be due to be paid to the uspto and various governmental patent agencies outside of the united states at several stages over the lifetime of the patents andor applications we have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees and we engage an outside service and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to nonus patent agencies the uspto and various nonus governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process we employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and in many cases an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules however there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction in such an event our competitors may be able to enter the market without infringing our patents and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  31 

patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time 

patents have a limited lifespan in the united states if all maintenance fees are timely paid the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest us nonprovisional filing date various extensions may be available but the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited even if patents covering our products are obtained once the patent life has expired we may be open to competition from competitive products if one of our products requires extended development testing andor regulatory review patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such products are commercialized as a result our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours 

risks related to legal proceedings and regulations 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof in the solar energy sector or international trade by federal or state agencies in the united states or foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to compete and could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

there has been and will continue to be regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector generally and the solar energy sector in particular changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations around the world could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or further changes in tariffs export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example several states or territories including california hawaii and queensland australia have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar power systems with which we may not be able to comply in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally if the us takes action to eliminate or reduce laws regulations and incentives supporting solar energy such actions may result in a decrease in demand for solar energy in the us and other geographical markets it would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the us trade environment including the recent imposition of import tariffs could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows 

escalating trade tensions between the us and china have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions including tariffs applicable to certain of our products for example in september 2018 the us began assessing 10 tariffs on certain solar products manufactured in china including our microinverter products and related accessories which are manufactured in china these tariffs increased to 25 in may 2019 and on january 2020 the united states and china entered into an initial trade deal which preserves the bulk of the tariffs imposed in 2018 and maintains a threat of additional sanctions should china breach the terms of the deal 

however in march 2020 the office of the us trade representative announced certain exclusion requests related to tariffs on chinese imported microinverter products that fit the dimensions and weight limits within a section 301 tariff exclusion the “tariff exclusion” the tariff exclusion applied to covered products exported from china to the united states from september 24 2018 until august 7 2020 accordingly we sought and received refunds totaling approximately 389 million plus approximately 06 million accrued interest on tariffs previously paid from september 24 2018 to march 31 2020 for certain microinverters that qualify for the tariff exclusion this 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  32 

exemption expired in august 2020 and our request to extend it has been denied unless us policy changes or we are eligible for other exemptions or take other actions to avoid them such tariffs will continue to apply to our microinverters and other products such tariffs could hurt the demand for these products and materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining exemptions or that any actions that we may pursue with respect to the organization and operation of our business will effectively mitigate the effects of any tariffs that apply to our business if we are not able to avoid or mitigate the effects of such tariffs the tariffs or mitigating actions we might take could result in material additional costs to us and our suppliers and our results of operations could be negatively impacted as a result 

it is unknown whether and to what extent additional new tariffs or other new laws or regulations will be adopted that increase the cost of manufacturing in china andor importing components from china to the united states further it is unknown what effect that any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions would have on us or our industry and customers our lfp lithiumion phosphate battery cells for our storage products are supplied solely via our two suppliers in china although we are in the process of searching for other suppliers outside of china for future supplies the expertise and industry for the lfp lithiumion phosphate battery cell is primarily in china and we cannot be certain that we will locate additional qualified suppliers with the right expertise to develop our battery cells outside of china if at all 

in response to the tensions in uschina trade relations and increased tariffs we focused efforts and resources on attaining manufacturers outside of china primarily in mexico and india the tariffs and the possibility of additional tariffs in the future have created uncertainty in the industry if the price of solar power systems in the united states increases the use of solar power systems could become less economically feasible and could reduce our gross margins or reduce the demand of solar power systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products additionally existing or future tariffs may negatively affect key partners suppliers and manufacturers such outcomes could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows and continuing uncertainty could cause sales volatility price fluctuations or supply shortages or cause our customers to advance or delay their purchase of our products it is difficult to predict what further traderelated actions governments may take which may include additional or increased tariffs and trade restrictions and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions as additional new tariffs legislation andor regulations are implemented or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if china or other affected countries take retaliatory trade actions such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our significant international operations subject us to additional risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations including in emerging markets such as india and we are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy as of december 31 2021 approximately 63 of our total employees were located in india where we primarily conduct our research and development activities procurement customer support services and other general and administrative support functions our current international operations and our plans to expand our international operations have placed and will continue to place a strain on our employees management systems and other resources we have instituted workfromhome policy which we expect will remain in effect in the first quarter of 2022 and could extend to future quarters we will continue to actively monitor the situation including progress made through vaccinations and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities and that we determine are in the best interests of our employees 

our international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in operating businesses internationally such as 

• our lack of familiarity with commercial and social norms and customs in countries which may adversely affect our ability to recruit retain and manage employees in these countries 

• difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations 

• the potential diversion of management’s attention to oversee and direct operations that are geographically distant from our us headquarters 

• compliance with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations including employment tax privacy and data protection laws and regulations 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  33 

• legal systems in which our ability to enforce and protect our rights may be different or less effective than in the united states and in which the ultimate result of dispute resolution is more difficult to predict 

• higher employee costs and difficulty in terminating nonperforming employees 

• differences in workplace cultures 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• tariffs export controls and other nontariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules 

• more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• adverse tax consequences including as a result of transfer pricing adjustments involving our foreign operations 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• antibribery compliance by us or our partners 

• restrictions on the transfer of funds 

• global epidemics pandemics or contagious diseases and 

• new and different sources of competition 

our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our existing and future international operations and seriously impair our overall business 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws 

the us fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into new jurisdictions through internal growth or acquisitions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards although we implement policies and procedures and conduct training designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws thereby mitigating the risk of violations of such laws our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings see discussion of “legal proceedings” in item 3 part i of this annual report on form 10k the outcome of some of these legal proceeding could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations there can also be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities additionally defending against lawsuits and legal proceedings may involve significant expense and could divert the attention of our key personnel 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  34 

risks related to our financial condition and liquidity 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

• changes in customer geographic or product mix 

• increased price competition including the impact of customer and competitor discounts and rebates 

• our ability to reduce and control product costs including our ability to make product cost reductions in a timely manner to offset declines in our product prices 

• warranty costs and reserves including changes resulting from changes in estimates related to the longterm performance of our products product replacement costs and warranty claim rates as well as changes in the discount rates 

• loss of cost savings due to changes in component or raw material pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if product demand is not correctly anticipated 

• introduction of new products 

• ordering patterns from our distributors 

• price reductions on older products to sell remaining inventory 

• component shortages and related expedited shipping costs 

• our ability to reduce production costs such as through technology innovations in order to offset price declines in our products over time 

• changes in shipment volume 

• changes in distribution channels 

• excess and obsolete inventory and inventory holding charges 

• expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements 

• tariffs assessed on our products imported to the us and elsewhere and 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

we are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our gross margins 

the solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time we have reduced the prices of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future including from our major customers in addition we have reduced our prices ahead of planned cost reductions of our products which has adversely affected our gross margins when seeking to maintain or increase their market share our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products in addition our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our gross margins would continue to be adversely affected 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  35 

given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological change a principal component of our business strategy is reducing the costs to manufacture our products to remain competitive if our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the efficiency of their products our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency and we may be forced to sell our products at a price lower than our cost further if raw materials costs and other thirdparty component costs were to increase we may not meet our cost reduction targets if we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap we may not be able to remain price competitive which would result in lost market share and lower gross margins 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or coalfired plants or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and depressing sales of our products in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid 

moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar industry including manufacturers of central inverters and dctodc optimizers could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to increase the cost of installation or operation of solar distributed generation such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our solutions is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory difficulties in planning expenses or disputes with suppliers any of which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  36 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material we may also become involved in disputes with our suppliers who may claim that we failed to fulfill forecast or minimum purchase requirements conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term due to the covid19 pandemic and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and costefficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications 

to date we have generated the majority of our revenues from north america and a substantial majority of our revenues come from the us and revenues generated from the us market have represented 80 82 and 84 of our total revenue for annual period ending on december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we also expect to continue to generate a substantial amount of our revenues from north america in the future 

there are a number of important incentives including us federal and state tax incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products in north america and other markets for instance the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provided a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 which was reduced to a tax credit of 26 for any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through december 31 2022 and 22 thereafter to december 31 2023 before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning on january 1 2024 as a result several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the irs published in june 2018 allowing them to preserve the historical 30 investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after december 31 2019 these tax credits could be reduced or eliminated as part of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” changes or regulatory reform initiatives by the current congress or the new presidential administration 

in addition net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and in some instances modified which may have a negative impact on future inverter sales we derive a significant portion of our revenues from california’s residential solar market and the existing california net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of residential solar power systems future legislative or regulatory changes in california such as the current nem 30 proposal may discourage further growth in the residential solar market 

a number of european countries including germany belgium italy and the united kingdom have adopted reductions in or concluded their net energy metering or fit programs certain countries have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe

we also sell our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a renewable energy target that is intended to ensure that 33000 gigawatthours of australia’s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020 this policy supports both the installation of largescale centralized renewable generation projects along with smallscale systems of under 100kw each for residential and small business customers this target was met in 2019 however the scheme continues to require highenergy users to meet their obligations under the policy until 2030 during 2018 the states of victoria and south australia introduced statebased incentive schemes aimed at solar customers in the state of victoria and battery storage in the state of south australia other australian states and territories introduced similar programs in 2019 any change in or failure to implement these programs may adversely affect the demand for solar energy solutions in australia 

us federal and state tax credits grants and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception however unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential solar market the phaseout of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy including local content requirements have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business domestically and abroad additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

our portfolio of marketable securities is subject to market interest and credit risk that may reduce its value 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 8973 million in debt security investments these investments consisted primarily of money market funds us treasuries us government securities commercial paper and debt securities of corporations we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our investment portfolio risk or income profile these investments as well as any cash deposited in bank accounts are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the covid19 pandemic and the us debt ceiling crisis which affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues if the global credit market continues to experience volatility or deteriorates our investment portfolio may be impacted and some or all of our investments may experience otherthantemporary impairment which could adversely impact our operating results and position 

risks related to our acquisition activity 

we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the sunpower transaction which may result in conflicts between us and sunpower 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the sunpower transaction will depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully execute the terms of the sunpower master supply agreement “msa” which is a complex and timeconsuming process any delay failure or breach of obligations under the msa could adversely impact the expected benefits of the transaction and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally in connection with the sunpower apa transaction sunpower acquired 75 million shares of our common stock in august 2018 and the right to designate one member of our board of directors as of december 31 2021 sunpower held 25 million shares of our common stock 

as part of growing our business we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions if we fail to successfully select execute or integrate our acquisitions then our business and operating results could be harmed and our stock price could decline 

from time to time we will undertake acquisitions to add new product lines and technologies gain new sales channels or enter new sales territories for example we acquired sofdesk the solar design business of din 365 pronto and clippercreek acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges including but not limited to the following 

• integrating the companies assets systems products sales channels and personnel that we acquire 

• higher than anticipated acquisition and integration costs and expenses 

• reliance on third parties to provide transition services for a period of time after closing to ensure an orderly transition of the business 

• growing or maintaining revenues to justify the purchase price and the increased expenses associated with acquisitions 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  38 

• entering into territories or markets with which we have limited or no prior experience 

• establishing or maintaining business relationships with customers vendors and suppliers who may be new to us 

• overcoming the employee customer vendor and supplier turnover that may occur as a result of the acquisition 

• disruption of and demands on our ongoing business as a result of integration activities including diversion of managements time and attention from running the day to day operations of our business 

• inability to implement uniform standards disclosure controls and procedures internal controls over financial reporting and other procedures and policies in a timely manner 

• inability to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses products technologies or personnel that we acquire and 

• potential postclosing disputes 

as part of undertaking an acquisition we may also significantly revise our capital structure or operational budget such as issuing common stock that would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders assuming liabilities or debt utilizing a substantial portion of our cash resources to pay for the acquisition or significantly increasing operating expenses our acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in charges being taken in an individual quarter as well as future periods which results in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate in any particular quarter may also be impacted by acquisitions following the closing of an acquisition we may also have disputes with the seller regarding contractual requirements and covenants purchase price adjustments contingent payments or for indemnifiable losses any such disputes may be time consuming and distract management from other aspects of our business in addition if we increase the pace or size of acquisitions we will have to expend significant management time and effort into the transactions and integrations and we may not have the proper human resources bandwidth to ensure successful integrations and accordingly our business could be harmed or the benefits of our acquisitions may not be realized 

as part of the terms of an acquisition we may commit to pay additional contingent consideration if certain revenue or other performance milestones are met we are required to evaluate the fair value of such commitments at each reporting date and adjust the amount recorded if there are changes to the fair value 

we cannot ensure that we will be successful in selecting executing and integrating acquisitions failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results in addition if stock market analysts or our stockholders do not support or believe in the value of the acquisitions that we choose to undertake our stock price may decline 

we invest in companies for both strategic and financial reasons but may not realize a return on our investments 

we have made and continue to seek to make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives these investments may include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and may be nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment we do not restrict the types of companies in which we seek to invest these companies may range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models if any company in which we invest fails we could lose all or part of our investment in that company if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have invested we will have to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related writedown as an investment loss the performance of any of these investments could result in significant impairment charges and gains losses on other equity investments we must also analyze accounting and legal issues when making these investments if we do not structure these investments properly we may be subject to certain unfavorable accounting impact such as potential consolidation of financial results 

furthermore if the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may seek to dispose of the investment our nonmarketable equity investments in private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all the occurrence of any of these events could harm our results gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities and impairment charges related to debt instruments as well as equity and other investments

an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible and longlived assets could negatively affect our operating results 

we record goodwill from the purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets recorded in connection with a business acquisition we may not realize all the economic benefit from our business acquisitions which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles as of december 31 2021 goodwill and amortizable intangible assets were approximately 1813 million and 978 million respectively we test goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level which we have determined to be the same as the entity as a whole entity level we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value if after assessing the qualitative factors we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment analysis will be performed 

qualitative factors include industry and market consideration overall financial performance share price trends and market capitalization and companyspecific events we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined which would negatively impact our operating results

in august 2018 we issued and sold a total of 650 million aggregate principal amount of our 40 convertible senior notes due 2023 the “notes due 2023” in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and an affiliate of ours in may 2019 we entered into separately and privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the notes due 2023 resulting in the repurchase and exchange of 600 million aggregate principal amount of the notes in consideration for the issuance of shares of common stock and separate cash payments 

the conversion condition for the notes due 2025 was met during the quarter ended december 31 2021 therefore the notes due 2025 became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on january 1 2022 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2022 accordingly we have classified the net carrying amount of the notes due 2025 of 861 million as debt current on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 

we may receive conversion requests that require settlement in the first quarter of 2022 if more holders elect to convert their notes due 2025 in future periods we intend to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation related to the aggregate principal amount in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent we receive conversion requests we may also record a loss on early conversions of the notes due 2025 converted by note holders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance on the settlement date 

as of december 31 2021

the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions in addition the anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

servicing our debts requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debts 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debts including the convertible notes and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of those activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations including our obligations under the convertible notes 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes or repurchase the convertible note upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes 

holders of our convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any fundamental change is defined in the convertible notes indenture entered into in connection with the financing and consists of events such as an acquisition of a majority of our outstanding common stock an acquisition of our company or substantially all of our assets the approval by our stockholders of a plan of liquidation or dissolution or our common stock no longer being listed on the nasdaq global select market or the nasdaq global market upon conversion of the convertible notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make such repurchase of the convertible notes in addition our ability to repurchase the convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the convertible notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the relevant indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the relevant indenture would constitute a default under the relevant indenture a default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversion of the convertible notes

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions andor their early termination may affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with the offering of the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions pursuant to which we have the option to purchase approximately the same number of shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 at a price approximately the same as the initial conversion price of the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 these transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions to acquire the same number of shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 subject to customary antidilution adjustments at an initial strike price of approximately 39791 39791 and 10694 per share for notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 respectively if the market value per share of our common stock as measured under the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants the warrants will have a dilutive effect on the ownership interests of existing stockholders and on our earnings per share unless we elect subject to certain conditions to settle the warrants in cash however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time of settlement 

in addition the existence of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may encourage purchasing and selling share of our common stock or other of our securities and instruments in open market andor privately negotiated transactions in order to modify hedge positions any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 

changes in current accounting methods standards or regulations applicable to the convertible notes due 2028  notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 could have a material impact on our reported financial results future financial results future cash flows andor our stock price 

under accounting standards codification “asc” 47020 “debt with conversion and other options” an entity must separately account for the host contract and conversion option associated with convertible debt instruments such as the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost for notes due 2028 and notes due 2026 conversion option meets the classification of an equity component hence we have included the equity component in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date for notes due 2025 conversion option met the classification of an embedded derivative liability from march 9 2020 to may 19 2020 and hence we had included embedded derivative liability in the debt noncurrent on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date effective upon the filing of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation on may 20 2020 the conversion option of the notes due 2025 met the classification of an equity component hence we reclassified the embedded derivative liability in the debt noncurrent to additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet on may 20 2020 this change in fair value of derivatives has resulted in a charge recognized of 443 million for the year ended december 31 2020 we have treated the value of the equity component and embedded derivative liability as debt discount for the host contract at the issuance date we are required to amortize the debt discount as noncash interest expense over the term of the notes due 2028 notes due 2026 and notes due 2025 which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results or the trading price of our common stock 

in addition we use the treasury stock method for convertible debt instruments such as the notes due 2028 and notes due 2026 since the date of issuance and notes due 2025 since may 20 2020 that may be settled entirely or partly in cash and the effect of which is that any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such notes exceeds their principal amount in august 2020 the fasb issued account standard update “asu” 202006 “debt  debt with conversion and other options subtopic 47020” effective january 1 2022 which requires the notes due 2028 and notes due 2026 to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost interest expense associated with the notes due 2028 and notes due 2026 recorded in the consolidated statements of operations will be close to the coupon rate interest expense further for the diluted earnings per share calculation treasury stock method will no longer be permitted for the notes due 2028 and notes due 2026 the ifconverted method will be used for the calculation of the diluted earnings per share calculation when accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2028 and notes due 2026 which will adversely affect our diluted earnings per share

• fluctuations in our gross profit 

• our ability to predict our revenue and plan our expenses appropriately 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

• announcement of acquisitions or dispositions of our assets or business operations 

• issuances of our common stock or equitylinked securities such as the convertible notes 

• changes in our management 

• technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport to macro industry or companyspecific fundamentals including without limitation the sentiment of retail investors including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites the amount and status of short interest in our securities access to margin debt trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging or other technical trading factors 

• general economic conditions and changes in such conditions specific to our target markets and 

• actions by research analysts such as if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the above factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital or debt financing to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 

• provide additional cash reserves to support our operations 

• invest in our research and development efforts 

• expand our operations into new product markets and new geographies 

• acquire complementary businesses products services or technologies or 

• otherwise pursue our strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures including adjustments to our business to mitigate the effects of any tariffs that might apply to us or our industry 

we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events and opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to agreed limits on sale volumes and the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act 

manipulative techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock 

short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender short sellers hope to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale as it is in the short seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline some short sellers publish or arrange for the publication of negative opinions regarding the issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short the use of the internet social media and blogging have allowed short sellers to publicly attack a company’s credibility strategy and veracity by means of socalled “research reports” that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by legitimate securities research analysts these short attacks have in the past led to stock price declines and significant selling activity in our common stock issuers with limited trading volumes or substantial retail shareholder bases can be particularly susceptible to higher volatility levels and can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  45 

short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental selfregulatory organization or other official authority in the us are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the sec in regulation analyst certification and accordingly the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or in some cases outright fabrications in light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information and the significant profits that can be made from running successful short attacks short sellers have issued such reports on our stock and will likely continue to issue such reports such shortseller attacks may cause our stock to suffer a decline in market price 

we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition our term loan agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends consequently an investor’s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

• providing for a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors 

• not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates 

• authorizing our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror 

• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders 

• requiring the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 23 of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock voting as a single class to amend provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business our board of directors stockholder action by written consent advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals forum selection and the liability of our directors or to amend our bylaws which may inhibit the ability of stockholders or an acquiror to effect such amendments to facilitate changes in management or an unsolicited takeover attempt 

• requiring special meetings of stockholders may only be called by our chairman of the board if any our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action including the removal of directors and 

• requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

general risks related to our business 

natural disasters public health events significant disruptions of information technology systems data security breaches or other catastrophic events could adversely affect our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters public health events and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in fremont california is located near major earthquake fault lines and our petaluma california facility is near fault lines and the sites of recent catastrophic wildfires we rely on thirdparty manufacturing facilities including for all product assembly and final testing of our products which are performed at thirdparty manufacturing facilities in china mexico and india there may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate including public health issues for example the ongoing covid19 pandemic or an outbreak of other contagious diseases or health epidemics safety issues natural disasters fire disruptions of service from utilities nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors such risks could result in an increase in the cost of components production delays general business interruptions delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs and other barriers and restrictions longer payment cycles increased taxes restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business 

further any terrorist attacks material disruption to our information technology systems or any data security breaches including due to cyberattacks especially any aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our cloudbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products or otherwise adverse affect us such significant disruptions of our our third party vendors’ andor business partners’ information technology systems or data security breaches including in our remote work environment as a result of covid19 could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss misappropriation andor unauthorized access use or disclosure of or the prevention of access to confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us any such event that leads to unauthorized access use or disclosure of personal information including personal information regarding our customers could harm our reputation compel us to comply with federal andor state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents subject us to mandatory corrective action require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information which could disrupt our business result in increased costs or loss of revenue andor result in legal and financial exposure in addition security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them may further harm us moreover the prevalent use of mobile devices to access confidential information increases the risk of security breaches while we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business in addition failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and subject us to regulatory scrutiny 

in the event that natural disasters public health epidemics or technical catastrophes were to damage or destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks to our business 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks to our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have in the past reduced demand for solar products for instance the european sovereign debt crisis in recent years has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales internationally 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  47 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act has required and will continue to require significant attention of management if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our business is subject to potential tax liabilities 

we are subject to income tax indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax reform act” contained many significant changes to the us federal income tax laws the consequences of which could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future us income tax expense as additional guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as new accounting treatment is clarified we may report additional adjustments in the period if new information becomes available we have a significant amount of deferred tax assets and a portion of the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits could be subject to limitations under the code sections 382 or 383 separate return limitation year rules the limitations could reduce our ability to utilize our net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes tax law changes or the limitations could be material and could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax indirect tax or other tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we cannot be certain that the final determination of our tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be a material adverse effect on our cash tax provisions and net income loss in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles  

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations historically the majority of our revenues are from the north american and european regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends including weather patterns and construction cycles the first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry due to these same factors in the us customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder and wetter months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future

safe harbor prepayments

income tax benefit provision 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products historically we have primarily been subject to taxation in the us because we have sold the majority of our products to customers in the us as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the us we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly we regularly assess the ability to realize deferred tax assets based on the weight of all available evidence including such factors as the history of recent earnings and expected future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 after considering these factors we determined that the positive evidence overcame any negative evidence primarily due to cumulative income in recent years and the expectation of sustained profitability in future periods and concluded that it was more likely than not that the us federal and state deferred tax assets were realizable as a result we released the valuation allowance against all of the us federal and state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019

results of operations 

net revenues 



net revenues increased by 78 or 6076 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 driven primarily by a 53 increase in microinverter units volume shipped and a 351 increase in enphase iq battery storage systems mwh shipped in the year ended december 31 2021 consumer demand improved from the same period in 2020 as we sold approximately 104 million microinverter units in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to approximately 68 million units in the year ended december 31 2020 we also increased shipments of our enphase iq battery storage systems to customers in the us and europe from 56 mwh in 2020 to 251 mwh in 2021 with over 1300 installers now deploying our enphase iq battery storage systems in the us business growth in the us and international regions resulted in a 74 and 100 respectively increase in net revenues in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase in net revenues is also due to favorable product mix as we sold more iq7™ microinverters relative to iq7™ microinverters and we made initial shipments of our iq8 tm solar microinverters in the fourth quarter of 2021 the average selling price of our microinverter products increased in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by customer mix and we increased prices to partially offset the impact of higher expedited freight costs and component costs 

cost of revenues and gross margin 



cost of revenues increased by 93 or 3992 million in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to higher volume of microinverter units sold higher shipments of our enphase iq battery storage systems higher expedited freight costs as a result of the covid19 pandemic globally in combination with semiconductor supply constraints higher costs of certain components experiencing supply constraints 85 million higher warranty expense based on continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic rootcause failure analysis primarily relating to our prior generation products as well as higher costs of certain components experiencing supply constraints and 389 million in refunds approved for tariffs previously paid on certain microinverter products and recorded as a reduction to our cost of revenues in the year ended december 31 2020  

gross margin decreased by 46 percentage points for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the 389 million in refunds approved for tariffs in the year ended december 31 2020 mentioned above higher expedited freight costs and increased component costs due to global supply constraints in the year ended december 31 2021 partially offset by the increase in average selling price due to changes in product customer mix and price increases as well as cost management efforts including the transition of our contract manufacturing from china to mexico and india to mitigate tariffs

research and development 



research and development expense increased by 89 or 496 million in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was due to 419 million of higher personnelrelated expenses and 77 million of outside consulting services and equipment expense associated with our investment in the development introduction and qualification of new product innovation the increase in personnelrelated expenses was primarily due to hiring and retention programs for employees in new zealand india and the us as well as onboarded employees through our recent acquisitions increasing total compensation costs including stockbased compensation the amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity 

sales and marketing 



sales and marketing expense increased by 144 or 760 million in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily due to 520 million of higher personnelrelated expenses primarily due to hiring employees as a result of our efforts to improve customer experience to provide 247 support along with field service desk for installers and enphase system owners globally and to support our business growth in the us and international expansion in europe as well as retention programs for employees increasing total compensation costs including stockbased compensation the increase in sales and marketing expense in the year ended december 31 2021  as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 is also attributable to 240 million for a combination of higher advertising costs marketing expenses professional services associated with our product launch and facility costs to enable business growth 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expense increased by 105 or 534 million in the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily due to 355 million of higher personnelrelated expenses primarily due to hiring and retention programs for employees increasing total compensation costs including stockbased compensation and post business combination employmentrelated expense 49 million of acquisition related costs 78 million of investments in technological infrastructure and other operational and facilities costs to support scalability of our business growth and 52 million of higher legal and professional services

income tax benefit 



the income tax benefit of 245 million for the year ended december 31 2021 increased compared to the income tax benefit of 146 million for the same period in 2020 both calculated using the annualized effective tax rate method primarily due to higher tax deduction from employee stockbased compensation partially offset by higher projected tax expense in us and foreign jurisdictions that are more profitable in 2021 compared to 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity 

as of december 31 2021 we had 10 billion in working capital including cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 10 billion of which approximately 10 billion were held in the us our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of us government money market mutual funds us treasuries corporate notes and bonds and both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries we consider amounts held outside the us to be accessible and have provided for the estimated us income tax liability associated with our foreign earnings 



we believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by 3373 million in the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to cash generated from operations and issuance of notes due 2026 and notes due 2028 partially offset by acquisitions the repurchase of common stocks purchases of property and equipment repayment of notes due 2024 and partial repayment of notes due 2025 

total carrying amount of debt increased by 7068 million primarily due to issuance of an aggregate principal amount of 6325 million of notes due 2026 and aggregate principal amount of 5750 million of notes due 2028 during the year ended december 31 2021 partially offset by 2177 million in aggregate principal amount of notes due 2025 repurchased and repaid in cash and settlement of remaining 881 million in aggregate principal amount of notes due 2024 

we expect that our principal shortterm over the next 12 months and longterm needs for cash relating to our operations will be to fund operating activities and working capital acquisitions and purchase of property and equipment such as production lines at our contract manufacturing partners 

we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and cash generated from operations we anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other things our development efforts business plans operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill useful lives of acquired intangible assets and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 

we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates due to risks and uncertainties including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of covid19 as of the date of issuance of these financial statements we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2  “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our solutions which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway the cloudbased enlighten monitoring service storage solutions electric vehicle “ev” charging solutions beginning in the first quarter of 2022 design proposal and permitting services as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and ondemand workforce of service providers to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners 

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services we generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers a description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are follows 

• products delivered at a point in time we sell our products and professional services to customers in accordance with the terms of the related customer contracts we generate revenues from sales of our solutions which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway and enlighten service communications accessories storage solutions ev charging solutions beginning in the first quarter of 2022 design proposal and permitting services as well as a platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and ondemand workforce of service providers to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners microinverter units microinverter accessories storage and ev solutions design proposal and permitting services as well as completed work orders on our platform matching cleantech asset owners to a local and ondemand workforce of service providers are delivered to customers at a point in time and we recognize revenue for these products or professional services when we transfer control of the product or professional services to the customer which is generally upon product shipment or service delivery respectively 

• products delivered over time the sale of an envoy communications gateway includes our enlighten cloudbased monitoring service the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 6 years we also sell certain communication accessories that contain a service performance obligation to be delivered over time the revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period which is typically 5 or 12 years the subscription services revenue generated from each customer’s subscription to our design and proposal service is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer the subscription contracts are generally three to twelve months in length and billed in advance

inventory 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market market is current replacement cost by purchase or by reproduction dependent on the type of inventory in cases where market exceeds net realizable value  ie  estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal inventories are stated at net realizable value market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin we determine cost on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory including customer demand and market conditions management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market 

fair value of financial instruments 

the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the carrying amounts of our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments equity investments with readily determinable fair value are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment and are adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer 

convertible note derivatives 

in march 2020 we issued 3200 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2025 concurrently with the issuance of notes due 2025 we entered into privatelynegotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which in combination are intended to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes due 2025 we could not elect to issue the shares of common stock upon settlement of notes due 2025 or convertible note hedge or warrant transactions due to insufficient authorized share capital as a result the embedded conversion option and warrants were accounted for as a derivative liabilities and convertible notes hedge as derivative asset and a gain or loss was reported in other expense net in our consolidated statement of operations to the extent the valuation changed from the date of issuance of notes due 2025 on may 20 2020 at our annual meeting of stockholders the stockholders approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock as a result we are now be able to settle the notes due 2025 convertible notes hedge and warrants through payment or delivery as the case may be of cash shares of its common stock or a combination thereof at our election accordingly on may 20 2020 the embedded derivative liability convertible notes hedge and warrants liability were remeasured at a fair value and were then reclassified to additional paidincapital in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 and are no longer remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification as of december 31 2020 we do not have any convertible note derivatives see note 13  “debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information

warranty obligations 

microinverters and other products sold through december 31 2013 

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units or other products that fail during the product’s warranty term 15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for subsequent generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time  ie failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time  ie claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time  ie replacement cost 

estimated failure rates — our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure “mtbf” estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into operating environments we continue to monitor product performance through our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months when a microinverter fails and is returned we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 

estimated claim rates — warranty claim rate estimates are based upon observed historical trends and assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 

estimated replacement costs — three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time typically between 15 and 25 years depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

in addition to the key estimates noted above we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates may be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material

fair value option for microinverters and other products sold since january 1 2014 

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provide us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty under accounting standards codification “asc 825” “financial instruments” also referred to as the “fair value option” an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years 

we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result the expected present value technique an income approach converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our creditadjusted riskfree rate see note 11  “fair value measurements” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

commitments and contingencies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to loss contingencies and loss recoveries such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business as well as tariff refunds an accrual for a loss contingency or loss recovery is recognized when it is probable and the amount of loss or recovery can be reasonably estimated see note 1 4  “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

business combinations 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles and liabilities acquired also requires the company to make estimates which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset accounting for business acquisitions requires the company to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract meaning that it includes other transaction components this judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction 

intangible assets 

intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 9 years indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis there was no impairment of intangible assets in any of the years presented 

income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  67 

we assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as necessary in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities we follow accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

on march 9 2020 we issued 3200 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2025 and entered into privatelynegotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which in combination are intended to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes due 2025 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 8154 to 10694 per share for the period from march 9 2020 through may 19 2020 the notes due 2025 convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could only be settled in cash because the number of authorized and unissued shares of our common stock that was not reserved for other purposes was less than the maximum number of underlying shares that would be required to settle the notes due 2025 convertible note hedge and warrants transactions as such the embedded conversion option associated with the notes due 2025 convertible notes hedge and warrants liability met the criteria for derivative accounting and as a result derivative financial instruments were markedtomarket at each reporting period the volatile market conditions arising from the covid19 pandemic resulted in significant changes in the price of our common stock in the first half of 2020 causing variability in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments and materially affecting our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 change in fair value of derivatives of 443 million for the year ended december 31 2020 includes the charge recognized for the change in fair value of our convertible notes embedded derivative and warrants of 476 million and 247 million respectively partially offset by a gain recognized for the change in fair value of our convertible notes hedge of 280 million 

on may 20 2020 we received approval at our annual meeting of stockholders to increase the authorized shares of our common stock par value 000001 per share from 150000000 shares to 200000000 shares as discussed further in note 1 3  “debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we reclassified the remeasured fair value of embedded derivative warrants and convertible notes hedge to additional paidincapital in the consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of this reclassification embedded derivative warrants and convertible notes hedge are no longer marked to fair value at each reporting period 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure primarily from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros indian rupee and australian canadian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european indian australian canadian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at december 31 2021 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we did not enter into any foreign currency forward contracts during 2021 and 2020 any foreign currency forward contracts entered in the 



enphase energy inc  2021 form 10k  68 

future are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

credit risk 

financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments we maintain a substantial portion of our cash balances in noninterestbearing and interestbearing marketable securities and money market accounts the derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement we mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings we are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes our net revenues are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated potential credit losses 

interest rate risk 

we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 10167 million and 6794 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively consisting of both noninterest bearing and interestbearing marketable securities and money market accounts such interestearning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk but the risk is limited due to the duration of our short term investments to date fluctuations in interest income have not been significant we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure we have not been exposed to nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates 

our cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited as the notes due 2025 and notes due 2023 have fixed interest rates of 025 and 40 respectively the fair value of the convertible notes may increase or decrease for various reasons including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions in the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized a 565 million noncash loss on settlement of approximately 881 million and 2177 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 and notes due 2025 respectively as a result of the change in fair value based upon the quoted market price as of december 31 2021 the fair value of our notes due 2025 was approximately 2400 million notes due 2023 are not actively traded and notes due 2024 are no longer outstanding 

a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements

covid19 update 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic “covid19” continues to cause disruptions and uncertainties including in the core markets in which we operate the covid19 pandemic has significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services and had a notable impact on general economic conditions including but not limited to the temporary closures of many businesses “shelter in place” orders and other governmental regulations and reduced consumer spending the most significant nearterm impacts of covid19 on our financial performance are a decline in sales orders as future residential and commercial system owners are canceling sales meetings with system installation professionals or postponing system installations as the purchase of new solar energy management solutions declines as part of the impact of covid19 on consumer spending many businesses through which we distribute our products are working at limited operational capacity the extent of the impact of covid19 on our future operational and financial performance will depend on various future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak duration of employees working remotely impact on our customers effect on our sales cycles or costs and effect on our supply chain and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted but which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition further information relating to the risks and uncertainties related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic may be found in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k 

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic “pv” installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems including the following 

• productivity limits  if solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter—group or “string” of modules are wired in series and an entire string’s output is limited by the output of the lowestperforming module because of its string design there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional central inverter approach 

• reli a bility issues  traditional central inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output as a result central inverters typically carry warranties of only 5 to 10 years 

• complex design and installation requirements  the central inverterbased solar pv installation requires greater effort on the part of the installer both in terms of design and onsite labor central inverter installations require string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation as well as specialized equipment such as dc combiners conduits and disconnects in addition the use of highvoltage direct current “dc” requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology 

• lack of monitoring  the majority of solar installations with central inverter technology offer limited monitoring capabilities if a module in a central inverter system fails or is not performing to specification the resulting loss of energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  7 

s 

• safety issues  central inverter solar pv installations have a wide distribution of highvoltage 600 volts to 1000 volts dc wiring if damaged dc wires can generate sustained electrical arcs reaching temperatures of more than 5000 °f this creates the risk of fire for solar pv installation owners and injury for installers and maintenance personnel 

these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

• installer  solar pv installers aim for simple installation design fast installation times and maximum system performance and predictability the installation of highvoltage dc central inverter technology however requires significant preparation precautionary safety measures timeconsuming string calculations extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment training and knowledge together these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer 

• system owner  solar power system owners aim for high energy production low cost high reliability and low maintenance requirements as well as reduced fire risks with traditional central inverters owners often are unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar pv installations due to string design limitations as such they experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions can face frequent system failures and lack the ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar pv installation in addition central inverter installations operate at highvoltage dc which bears significant fire risks further due to their large size central inverter installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building 

the solar industry is transitioning from solar only systems to complete energy management solutions which consist of solarplus storage and load control 

our products

we operate in an industry in which innovation investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property “ip” rights are critical for success we protect our technology through a variety of means including through patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements as of december 31 2020 we had 234 issued us patents 80 issued foreign patents 60 pending us patent applications and 33 pending foreign counterpart patent applications our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2021 and 2040 

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our custom application specific integrated circuits “asic”s under a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any thirdparty manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market the license carries a 75year term subject to earlier termination upon agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices “cplds” and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion and energy storage for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter and storage manufacturing processes involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

we own or have rights to various registered trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries including enphase ensemble encharge envoy enpower and enlighten and rely on both registration of our marks as well as common law protection where available 

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans

s 

as part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology 

seasonality 

historically the majority of our revenues are from the north american and european regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends including weather patterns and construction cycles the first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry due to these same factors although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

government regulations 

our business activities are global and are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations for example substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions in addition the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions changes in tax policy or trade regulations the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations compliance with these laws rules and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures and results of operations 

privacy and security laws 

there are also data privacy and security laws to which we are currently andor may in the future be subject the us federal government individual us states eu member countries and other jurisdictions including switzerland have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations moreover the collection and use of personal health data in the eu is governed by the provisions of the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” 

the gdpr which is wideranging in scope imposes several requirements relating to the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates the information provided to the individuals the documentation we must maintain the security and confidentiality of the personal data data breach notification and the use of thirdparty processors in connection with the processing of personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance including the potential for significant fines the gdpr requirements apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including employee information the gdpr has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to all types of personal data that we process including in clinical trials and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the gdpr which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business however despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the gdpr we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control or other factors outside our control it is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the gdpr leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various eu member states

s 

additionally in june 2018 the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which contains requirements similar to gdpr for the handling of personal information of california residents which became effective in january 2020 the ccpa establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for california residents the ccpa includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action the ccpa requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers as that word is broadly defined in the ccpa provide such consumers new ways to optout of certain sales of personal information and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches it remains unclear how the ccpa will be interpreted but as currently written it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data as we expand our operations the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability some observers have noted that the ccpa could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states additionally other states are beginning to pass similar laws 

government incentives 

us federal state and local government bodies as well as nonus government bodies provide incentives to owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates tax credits lower vat rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments the market for on‑grid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives which vary by geographic market and from time to time thus helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utilityprovided power 

our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted by the scheduled phasedown of the investment tax credit for solar projects under section 48a the “itc” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provided a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 which was reduced to a tax credit of 26 for any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through december 31 2022 and 22 thereafter to december 31 2023 before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning on january 1 2024 as a result several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the irs published in june 2018 allowing them to preserve the historical 30 investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after december 31 2019

risks related to our business operations and our industry 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate including as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic our business will suffer 

our microinverter and ac battery storage systems are utilized in solar pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model under which businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  15 

s 

• market acceptance of solar pv systems based on our product platform 

• cost competitiveness reliability and performance of solar pv systems compared to conventional and nonsolar renewable energy sources and products 

• availability and amount of government subsidies and incentives to support the development and deployment of solar energy solutions 

• the extent to which the electric power industry and broader energy industries are deregulated to permit broader adoption of solar electricity generation 

• the cost and availability of key raw materials and components used in the production of solar pv systems 

• prices of traditional utilityprovided energy sources 

• levels of investment by endusers of solar energy products which tend to decrease when economic growth slows and 

• the emergence continuance or success of or increased government support for other alternative energy generation technologies and products 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow demand for our customers’ products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology have recently caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of lowercost manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

further our success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the demand for solar energy solutions decreased in the second and third quarters of 2020 compared to the same quarters of the prior year the demand for solar energy solutions may continue to decrease or at least not continue its growth relative to prepandemic periods and recent years as a result of government orders associated with the covid19 pandemic due to adverse worldwide economic and market conditions or other factors if demand for solar energy solutions decreases or does not grow demand for our customers’ products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

the solar energy industry is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy and is undergoing and subject to rapid change the solar energy industry will take several more years to develop and further mature which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and we cannot be certain that the market will grow to the size or at the rate we expect we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  16 

s 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components and products on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components of our products such as our asics and lithiumion batteries any of the solesource and limitedsource suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues stop producing our components cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of solesource or limitedsource components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

our business has been affected by is currently being adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the current impacts and evolving effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic may continue to and other actual or threatened epidemics pandemics outbreaks or public health crises may in the future adversely affect our and our customers’ results of operations and financial condition our supply chain and our business 

our business has been affected by is currently being adversely affected and could be materially and adversely affected in the future by the evolving effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the ongoing covid19 pandemic also continues to have worldwide impact resulting in a global slowdown of economic activity which has decreased demand for a broad variety of goods and services including from our customers while also disrupting sales channels and marketing activities as a result the ongoing covid19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations we are closely evaluating the impacts of the evolving effects of the covid19 pandemic on our ability and the ability of our thirdparty partners to effectively market maintain supply sell and distribute our products further even though vaccine programs have recently been initiated there is no current indication whether these vaccine programs will be effective we are currently unable to predict how long the covid19 pandemic will continue whether vaccinations or other actions will contain the pandemic and the extent and duration of the pandemic’s continued impact on our current or future performance 

among other impacts the covid19 pandemic and associated governmental orders including the various “shelterinplace” orders slowed the demand for our products and we expect the pandemic will continue to reduce demand for our products and impede or cause temporary and longterm disruptions in solar installations our supply chains andor delays in the delivery of our products the most significant nearterm impacts of covid19 on our financial performance have been a decline in sales orders as future residential and commercial system owners are canceling sales meetings with system installation professionals or postponing system installations as the purchase of new solar energy management solutions declines as part of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on consumer spending many businesses through which we distribute our products are working at limited operational capacity 

moreover the covid19 pandemic and associated governmental orders could require or cause employees to continue to “shelterinplace” for longer periods of time which could adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and manage our businesses while our fieldbased personnel are engaging in limited inperson interactions they are primarily using electronic communication such as emails phone calls and video conferences we expect the different quality of electronic interactions as compared with inperson interactions as well as the reduced quantity of interactions during the covid19 pandemic to reduce the effectiveness of our sales personnel as well as those of our partners which have and could negatively affect our sales and future revenue further such risks could also adversely affect our customers financial condition resulting in reduced spending for our solar products 

the global spread of covid19 and the efforts to control it have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect global supply chains any disruptions to our suppliers and manufacturers by for example worker absenteeism quarantines office and factory closures disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure or other travel or healthrelated restrictions have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business and operations for example the general market for the semiconductors has been disrupted by the 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  17 

s 

covid19 pandemic and that disruption has impacted and may in future further impact the component supply for our iq7 and iq8 products as a result of these supply chain disruptions we are working to expand our supplier base but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that supply chain disruptions will not continue or worsen limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or delays in production or delivery of components due to covid19related restrictions could delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished products and offerings which could adversely affect our business operations and customer relationships 

our liquidity also may be negatively impacted if sales decline significantly for an extended period due to the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic further the extent to which the ongoing covid19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto impact our business and liquidity will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be precisely predicted at this time 

the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including those that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time including the ultimate duration of the pandemic travel restrictions quarantines social distancing and business closure requirements in the us and other countries and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease it is possible that additional legislation or governmental action will be taken in response to the evolving effects of the covid19 pandemic we cannot assure you as to the ultimate content timing or effect of changes nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation or governmental action however such changes or the ultimate impact of changes could negatively affect our revenue or sales of our current and or potential future products moreover the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic remain unknown and it is possible that following the pandemic inperson interactions will remain limited which would negatively impact our sales team and our future revenues these and other potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic discussed elsewhere in this “risk factors” section as well as any future and unforeseen risks related to the pandemic not yet contemplated could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations to the extent the evolving effects of the covid19 pandemic adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section 

it is also possible that future global pandemics could also occur and also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon a solesource and small number of outside contract manufacturers and our business and operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products in particular we outsource the manufacturing of our products to manufacturing partners flex ltd and affiliates “flex” and salcomp manufacturing india pvt ltd “salcomp” assemble and test our microinverter ac battery storage systems and envoy products prices for such services are agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the related agreements as of december 31 2020 our related purchase obligations including amounts related to component inventory procured by our primary contract manufacturers on our behalf were approximately 1622 million the timing of purchases in future periods could differ materially from our estimates due to fluctuations in demand requirements related to varying sales levels as well as changes in economic conditions 

flex also provides receiving kitting storage transportation inventory visibility and other valueadded logistics services at locations managed by flex hong kong sinbon industrial limited manufactures our custom ac cables during the fourth quarter of 2020 we qualified amperex technology limited in addition to a123 systems llc as our lithiumion batteries suppliers to help increase our available capacity in addition we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our products 

our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our contract manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price if any of these suppliers reduce or eliminate the supply of the components to us in the future our revenues business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  18 

s 

further the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which the vast majority of our products are manufactured are located outside of the us we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the us increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers which may not be available to us on favorable terms if at all for example we have experienced a volume shortage of components and may experience in future as well an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business 

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments which would adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

we have in the past and may in the future experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in one of our contract manufacturers’ facilities due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials covid19 pandemic impacts or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the schedules requested which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  19 

s 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages and changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

component shortages have required us and may continue to require us to incur expedited shipping costs to meet delivery schedules which impacts our revenue and gross profit 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of product lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension of an individual product line could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we rely primarily on distributors installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products to customers and the failure of these customers to perform at the expected level or at all would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of our operations 

we sell our solutions primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and developers of thirdparty solar finance offerings we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties as a result many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

in addition while we provide our distributors and installers with training and other programs including accreditations and certifications these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently in addition new partners may require extensive training and may take significant time and resources to achieve productivity our partners may subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations or violate laws or our policies in addition our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property ownership could constrain the growth and development of these partnerships or result in the termination of one or more partnerships if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted and our operating results may be harmed 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

the solar industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce products or develop alternative technologies which could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we compete primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers as well as against new solutions and emerging technologies that directly compete with our business a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our solutions in the modulelevel power electronics market

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial marketing distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition especially in certain markets in addition some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and creating market awareness for these offerings further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices of our products in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

we also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform dctoac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our systems or sell products that compete with our systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 one customer accounted for approximately 29 of total net revenues further as of december 31 2020 amounts due from one customer represented approximately 36 of the total accounts receivable balance and amounts due from three customers represented 34 14 and 11 of the total accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2019 our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements generally do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period in addition these customers may decide to no longer use or to reduce the use of our products and services for other reasons that may be out of our control we may also be affected by events impacting our large customers that result in their decreasing their orders with us or impairing their ability to pay for our products the loss of or events affecting one or more of our large customers have had from time to time and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our microinverter systems including our storage solution integrated ac module eighthgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share 

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products including international acceptance of our eighthgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology announced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and for which product shipments commenced during the second quarter of 2020 there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 

• our ability to produce pv systems that compete favorably against other solutions on the basis of price quality reliability and performance 

• our ability to timely introduce and complete new designs and timely qualify and certify our products 

• whether installers system owners and solar financing providers will continue to adopt our systems which have a relatively limited history with respect to reliability and performance 

• whether installers system owners and solar financing providers will adopt our storage solution which is a relatively new technology with a limited history with respect to reliability and performance 

• the ability of prospective system owners to obtain longterm financing for solar pv installations based on our product platform on acceptable terms or at all 

• our ability to develop products that comply with local standards and regulatory requirements as well as potential incountry manufacturing requirements and 

• our ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with our customers and suppliers 

in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central or string inverters or who currently sell dctodc optimizers these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central or string inverter systems or dc optimizers which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our solutions 

our success in marketing and selling “ac module” versions of our microinverter system depends in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers 

we continue to work on variants of our microinverter systems that enable direct attachment of a microinverter to solar modules the market success of such “ac module” solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with sunpower and other solar module manufacturers to design microinverters that are compatible with and can be attached directly to solar modules we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial challenges faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules and the tariffs in the us 

our recent and planned expansion into existing and new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we currently offer solar microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets throughout the world and we intend to expand into other international markets our success in new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 

• acceptance of microinverters in markets in which they have not traditionally been used 

• our ability to compete in new product markets to which we are not accustomed 

• our ability to manage manufacturing capacity and production 

• willingness of our potential customers to incur a higher upfront capital investment than may be required for competing solutions 

• timely qualification and certification of new products

• our ability to reduce production costs in order to price our products competitively 

• availability of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy solutions 

• accurate forecasting and effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand 

• our customer service capabilities and responsiveness and 

• timely hiring of the skilled employees and efficient execution of our project plan 

further new geographic markets and larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

• differing regulatory requirements including tax laws trade laws labor safety local content recycling and consumer protection regulations tariffs export quotas customs duties or other trade restrictions 

• limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection 

• risk of change in international political or economic conditions 

• restrictions on the repatriation of earnings 

• fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 

• difficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of us and foreign laws regulations and trade standards including the foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act 

• potentially longer sales cycles 

• generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• higher volume requirements 

• increased customer concentrations 

• warranty expectations and product return policies and 

• cost performance and compatibility requirements 

failure to address these new markets successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these markets to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

we may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing 

we are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets we have made investments in our infrastructure increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so any new product is subject to certain risks including component sourcing strategic partner selection and execution customer acceptance competition product differentiation market timing challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow if we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new product introductions these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline projected thus having a materially adverse impact on our revenue operating results and financial stability 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced our eightgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology we started production shipments of ensemble technology to customers in north america during the second quarter of 2020 our new products are complex and require significant preparation precautionary safety measures timeconsuming string calculations extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment training and knowledge together these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer our installers may not have sufficient resources or expertise necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect which could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key personnel in areas such as engineering marketing and sales any of whom would be difficult to replace for example we are highly dependent on our president and chief executive officer badrinarayanan kothandaraman mr kothandaraman possesses technical knowledge of our business operations and strategy and he has substantial experience and contacts that help us implement our goals strategy and plan if we lose his services or if he decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us our business operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 

all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience if we are not able to continue to attract train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business the progress of our product development programs could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected to help attract retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees we use stockbased incentive awards including restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened which could harm our business and results of operations also if the value of our stock awards increases substantially this could potentially create substantial personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel in addition any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees 

additionally our ability to attract qualified personnel including senior management and key technical personnel is critical to the execution of our growth strategy competition for qualified senior management personnel and highly skilled individuals with technical expertise is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in all areas of our business in addition integrating new employees into our team could prove disruptive to our operations require substantial resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful our failure to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key technical personnel could limit or delay our strategic efforts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

any failure by management to properly manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our business has grown rapidly and if our business develops as currently expected we anticipate that we will continue to grow rapidly in the near future our expected rapid growth could place significant demands on our management operations systems accounting internal controls and financial resources and it may also negatively impact our ability to retain key personnel if we experience difficulties in any of these or other areas we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth any failure by management to manage our growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

although we primarily sell our solutions and products directly to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators who then in turn integrate our products into complete solar pv installations for residential and commercial system owners we have recently invested significant resources in our directtoconsumer sales channel through our website and our future growth relies in part on our ability to attract consumers through this channel expanding our directtoconsumer sales model will require significant expenditures in marketing software development and infrastructure further the success of directtoconsumer sales through our website is also subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal state foreign and provincial regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce these regulations and laws may cover taxation tariffs privacy data protection pricing distribution electronic contracts and other communications consumer protection and intellectual property these laws and regulations can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell our products directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

further the expansion of our directtoconsumer channel could alienate some of our existing partners and cause a reduction in sales from these partners our existing partners may perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage based on the directtoconsumer sales offered through our website due to these and other factors conflicts in our sales channels could arise and cause our existing partners to divert resources away from the promotion and sale of our products if we are unable to successfully continue to drive traffic to and increase sales through our website our business and results of operations could be harmed

risks related to our intellectual property and technology 

we could be subject to breaches of our information technology systems which could cause significant reputational legal and financial damages 

like many companies we use and store a wide variety of confidential and proprietary information relating to our business the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation despite our implementation of security measures our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks worms and other malicious software programs or other attacks covert introduction of malware to computers and networks unauthorized access including impersonation of unauthorized users efforts to discover and exploit any security vulnerabilities or securities weaknesses and other similar disruptions these types of attacks have increased in general as more businesses implement remote working environments although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology and related systems and have implemented measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

the techniques used in attempted cyberattacks and intrusions are sophisticated and constantly evolving and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures although to date we have not experienced any material breaches of our systems that could have material adverse effect on our business attacks and intrusions on our systems will continue and we may experience a breach of our systems that compromises sensitive company information or customer data in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to reputational damage and significant costs including to rebuild our systems modify our products and services defend litigation respond to government enforcement actions pay damages or take other remedial steps any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future 

we may also share information with contractors and thirdparty providers to conduct our business although such contractors and thirdparty providers typically implement encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data those thirdparty providers may experience a significant data security breach which may also detrimentally affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the software we use in providing system configuration recommendations or potential energy savings estimates to customers relies in part on third party information that may not be accurate or uptodate this may therefore generate inaccurate recommendations or estimates resulting in a loss of reputation and customer confidence 

we provide our customers online tools to help them determine proper system sizing and configurations estimates of bill savings and potential revenues resulting from executing a specific curtailment strategy these estimates are in turn based on a number of factors such as customer tariff structures estimated wholesale electricity prices and estimates of the reduction in electricity usage as a result of a curtailment activity if the estimates we provide prove to be significantly different from actual payments or savings received by our customers it may result in the loss of reputation andor customer confidence

we are subject to stringent privacy laws information security policies and contractual obligations governing the use processing and transfer of personal information and any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

we are subject to a variety of local state national and international laws directives and regulations that apply to the collection use retention protection disclosure transfer and other processing of personal data in the different jurisdictions in which we operate including comprehensive regulatory systems in the us and europe california enacted the california consumer privacy act “ccpa which creates individual privacy rights for california consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data the ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 and became enforceable by the california attorney general on july 1 2020 the ccpa has been amended from time to time and further a new privacy law the california privacy rights act or cpra was approved by california voters in the november 3 2020 election effective starting january 1 2023 the cpra will significantly modify the ccpa including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information the cpra also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and the cpra it remains unclear what if any further modifications will be made to the ccpa or cpra or how such legislation will be interpreted certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations and all 50 states have laws including obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals state officers and others 

in may 25 2018 the european union “eu” implemented the general data protection regulation “gdpr” a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current eu data protection law to noneuropean union entities that process or control the processing of the personal information of eu subjects 

the gdpr imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including for example more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime shortened timelines for data breach notifications limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to special categories of data such as health data and additional obligations when we contract with thirdparty processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu and the eea to the united states and other third countries in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union issued a decision that struck down the euus privacy shield framework which provided companies with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the eu to the united states and additionally called into question the validity of the european commission’s standard contractual clauses on which us companies rely to transfer personal data from europe to the united states and elsewhere if we or our vendors fail to comply with the gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu or eea member states or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with these laws it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties further following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu and the eea and the expiry of the transition period companies have to comply with both the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom national law the data protection act of 2018 the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover the relationship between the united kingdom and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction which exposes us to further compliance risk 

compliance with us and international data protection laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business our and our collaborators’ and contractors’ failure to fully comply with gdpr the california consumer privacy act of 2018 and other laws could lead to significant fines and require onerous corrective action in addition

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against our competitors we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe upon any intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the us and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent applications an adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

• obtain from a thirdparty claiming infringement a license to sell or use the relevant technology which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 

• stop manufacturing selling incorporating or using products that embody the asserted intellectual property 

• pay substantial monetary damages 

• indemnify our customers under some of our customer contracts or 

• expend significant resources to redesign the products that use the infringing technology or to develop or acquire noninfringing technology

we have licensed and in the future we may choose or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development and marketing of our products we cannot assure you that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost 

further such licenses may be nonexclusive which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property the licensing or acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive area and other established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size capital resources or greater development or commercialization capabilities in addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us we could encounter delays and incur significant costs in product or service introductions while we attempt to develop alternative products or services or redesign our products or services to avoid infringing third party patents or proprietary rights failure to obtain any such licenses or to develop a workaround could prevent us from commercializing products or services and the prohibition of sale or the threat of the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could materially affect our business and our ability to gain market acceptance for our products or services 

in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software further companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging their use of open source software and compliance with open source license terms as a result we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code there is little legal precedent in this area and any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could harm our business and could help third parties including our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours any of the above could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage

patents have a limited lifespan in the united states if all maintenance fees are timely paid the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest us nonprovisional filing date various extensions may be available but the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited even if patents covering our products are obtained once the patent life has expired we may be open to competition from competitive products if one of our products requires extended development testing andor regulatory review patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such products are commercialized as a result our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours 

risks related to legal proceedings and regulations 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof in the solar energy sector or international trade by federal or state agencies in the united states or foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to compete and could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

there has been and will continue to be regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector generally and the solar energy sector in particular changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations around the world could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or further changes in tariffs export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example several states or territories including california hawaii and queensland australia have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar power systems with which we may not be able to comply in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected

s 

additionally if the us takes action to eliminate or reduce laws regulations and incentives supporting solar energy such actions may result in a decrease in demand for solar energy in the us and other geographical markets it would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the us trade environment including the recent imposition of import tariffs could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows 

escalating trade tensions between the us and china have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions including tariffs applicable to certain of our products for example on september 24 2018 the us began assessing 10 tariffs on certain solar products manufactured in china including our microinverter products and related accessories which are manufactured in china these tariffs increased to 25 in may 2019 and on january 15 2020 the united states and china entered into an initial trade deal which preserves the bulk of the tariffs imposed in 2018 and maintains a threat of additional sanctions should china breach the terms of the deal 

however on march 26 2020 the office of the us trade representative announced certain exclusion requests related to tariffs on chinese imported microinverter products that fit the dimensions and weight limits within a section 301 tariff exclusion the “tariff exclusion” the tariff exclusion applied to covered products exported from china to the united states from september 24 2018 until august 7 2020 accordingly we sought refunds totaling approximately 389 million plus approximately 06 million accrued interest on tariffs previously paid from september 24 2018 to march 31 2020 for certain microinverters that qualify for the tariff exclusion as of december 31 2020 we have received 248 million of tariff refunds and accrued for the remaining 147 million tariff refunds that were approved however not yet received on or before december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded 389 million as a reduction to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the approved refunds relate to paid tariffs previously recorded to cost of revenues therefore we recorded the corresponding approved tariff refunds as credits to cost of revenues in the current period for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded the 06 million accrued interest as interest income in our consolidated statement of operations the tariff refund receivable of 147 million is recorded as a reduction of accounts payable to flex ltd and affiliates our manufacturing partner and the importer of record who will first receive the tariff refunds on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 this exemption has expired in august 2020 and our request to extend it has been denied unless us policy changes or we are eligible for other exemptions or take other actions to avoid them such tariffs will continue to apply to our microinverters and other products such tariffs could hurt the demand for these products and materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining exemptions or that any actions that we may pursue with respect to the organization and operation of our business will effectively mitigate the effects of any tariffs that apply to our business if we are not able to avoid or mitigate the effects of such tariffs the tariffs or mitigating actions we might take could result in material additional costs to us and our suppliers and our results of operations could be negatively impacted as a result 

it is unknown whether and to what extent additional new tariffs or other new laws or regulations will be adopted that increase the cost of manufacturing in china andor importing components from china to the united states further it is unknown what effect that any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions would have on us or our industry and customers our lfp lithiumion phosphate battery cells for our storage products are supplied solely via our two suppliers in china although we are in the process of searching for other suppliers outside of china for future supplies the expertise and industry for the lfp lithiumion phosphate battery cell is primarily in china and we cannot be certain that we will locate additional qualified suppliers with the right expertise to develop our battery cells outside of china if at all 

in response to the tensions in uschina trade relations and increased tariffs we focused efforts and resources on attaining manufacturers outside of china primarily in mexico and india the tariffs and the possibility of additional tariffs in the future have created uncertainty in the industry if the price of solar power systems in the united states increases the use of solar power systems could become less economically feasible and could reduce our gross margins or reduce the demand of solar power systems manufactured and sold which in turn may decrease demand for our products additionally existing or future tariffs may negatively affect key partners suppliers and manufacturers such outcomes could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues results of operations or cash flows and continuing uncertainty could cause sales volatility price fluctuations or supply shortages or cause our customers to advance or delay their purchase of our products it is difficult to predict what further traderelated actions governments may take which may include additional or increased tariffs and trade restrictions and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions as additional new tariffs legislation andor regulations are implemented or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if china or other

our significant international operations subject us to additional risks that could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have significant international operations including in emerging markets such as india and we are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy as of december 31 2020 approximately 41 of our total employees were located in india where we primarily conduct our research and development activities procurement customer support services and other general and administrative support functions our current international operations and our plans to expand our international operations have placed and will continue to place a strain on our employees management systems and other resources 

our international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in operating businesses internationally such as 

• our lack of familiarity with commercial and social norms and customs in countries which may adversely affect our ability to recruit retain and manage employees in these countries 

• difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations 

• the potential diversion of management’s attention to oversee and direct operations that are geographically distant from our us headquarters 

• compliance with multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations including employment tax privacy and data protection laws and regulations 

• legal systems in which our ability to enforce and protect our rights may be different or less effective than in the united states and in which the ultimate result of dispute resolution is more difficult to predict 

• higher employee costs and difficulty in terminating nonperforming employees 

• differences in workplace cultures 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• tariffs export controls and other nontariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules 

• more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• adverse tax consequences including as a result of transfer pricing adjustments involving our foreign operations 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• antibribery compliance by us or our partners 

• restrictions on the transfer of funds 

• global epidemics pandemics or contagious diseases and 

• new and different sources of competition 

our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our existing and future international operations and seriously impair our overall business

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into new jurisdictions through internal growth or acquisitions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards although we implement policies and procedures and conduct training designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws thereby mitigating the risk of violations of such laws our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are or may become involved in legal proceedings government and agency investigations and consumer employment tort and other litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings see discussion of “legal proceedings” in item 3 part i of this annual report on form 10k the outcome of some of these legal proceeding could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations there can also be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities additionally defending against lawsuits and legal proceedings may involve significant expense and could divert the attention of our key personnel 

risks related to our financial condition and liquidity 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries including the us have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs “fits” rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy

s 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions where we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place furthermore electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

• changes in customer geographic or product mix 

• increased price competition including the impact of customer and competitor discounts and rebates 

• our ability to reduce and control product costs including our ability to make product cost reductions in a timely manner to offset declines in our product prices 

• warranty costs and reserves including changes resulting from changes in estimates related to the longterm performance of our products product replacement costs and warranty claim rates as well as changes in the discount rates 

• loss of cost savings due to changes in component or raw material pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if product demand is not correctly anticipated 

• introduction of new products 

• ordering patterns from our distributors 

• price reductions on older products to sell remaining inventory 

• component shortages and related expedited shipping costs 

• our ability to reduce production costs such as through technology innovations in order to offset price declines in our products over time 

• changes in shipment volume 

• changes in distribution channels 

• excess and obsolete inventory and inventory holding charges 

• expediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements 

• tariffs assessed on our products imported to the us and elsewhere and 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

we are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our gross margins 

the solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time we have reduced the prices of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future including from our major customers in addition we have reduced our prices ahead of planned cost reductions of our products which has adversely affected our gross margins when seeking to maintain or increase their market share our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products in addition our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our gross margins would continue to be adversely affected 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  35 

s 

given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological change a principal component of our business strategy is reducing the costs to manufacture our products to remain competitive if our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the efficiency of their products our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency and we may be forced to sell our products at a price lower than our cost further if raw materials costs and other thirdparty component costs were to increase we may not meet our cost reduction targets if we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap we may not be able to remain price competitive which would result in lost market share and lower gross margins 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or coalfired plants or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and depressing sales of our products in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar industry including manufacturers of central inverters and dctodc optimizers could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to increase the cost of installation or operation of solar distributed generation such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our solutions is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory difficulties in planning expenses or disputes with suppliers any of which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  36 

s 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material we may also become involved in disputes with our suppliers who may claim that we failed to fulfill forecast or minimum purchase requirements conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term due to the covid19 pandemic and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and costefficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications 

to date we have generated the majority of our revenues from north america and a substantial majority of our revenues come from the us and revenues generated from the us market have represented 82 84 and 69 of our total revenue for annual period ending on december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we also expect to continue to generate a substantial amount of our revenues from north america in the future 

there are a number of important incentives including us federal and state tax incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products in north america and other markets for instance the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provided a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 which was reduced to a tax credit of 26 for any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through december 31 2022 and 22 thereafter to december 31 2023 before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning on january 1 2024 as a result several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the irs published in june 2018 allowing them to preserve the historical 30 investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after december 31 2019 these tax credits could be reduced or eliminated as part of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” changes or regulatory reform initiatives by the current congress or the new presidential administration 

in addition net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and in some instances modified which may have a negative impact on future inverter sales we derive a significant portion of our revenues from california’s residential solar market and the existing california net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of residential solar power systems future legislative or regulatory changes in california may discourage further growth in the residential solar market 

a number of european countries including germany belgium italy and the united kingdom have adopted reductions in or concluded their net energy metering or fit programs certain countries have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe

we also sell our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a renewable energy target that is intended to ensure that 33000 gigawatthours of australia’s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020 this policy supports both the installation of largescale centralized renewable generation projects along with smallscale systems of under 100kw each for residential and small business customers this target was met in 2019 however the scheme continues to require highenergy users to meet their obligations under the policy until 2030 during 2018 the states of victoria and south australia introduced statebased incentive schemes aimed at solar customers in the state of victoria and battery storage in the state of south australia other australian states and territories introduced similar programs in 2019 any change in or failure to implement these programs may adversely affect the demand for solar energy solutions in australia 

us federal and state tax credits grants and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception however unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential solar market the phaseout of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy including local content requirements have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business domestically and abroad additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations

• inability to implement uniform standards disclosure controls and procedures internal controls over financial reporting and other procedures and policies in a timely manner 

• inability to realize the anticipated benefits of or successfully integrate with our existing business the businesses products technologies or personnel that we acquire and 

• potential postclosing disputes 

as part of undertaking an acquisition we may also significantly revise our capital structure or operational budget such as issuing common stock that would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders assuming liabilities or debt utilizing a substantial portion of our cash resources to pay for the acquisition or significantly increasing operating expenses our acquisitions have resulted and may in the future result in charges being taken in an individual quarter as well as future periods which results in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate in any particular quarter may also be impacted by acquisitions following the closing of an acquisition we may also have disputes with the seller regarding contractual requirements and covenants purchase price adjustments contingent payments or for indemnifiable losses any such disputes may be time consuming and distract management from other aspects of our business in addition if we increase the pace or size of acquisitions we will have to expend significant management time and effort into the transactions and integrations and we may not have the proper human resources bandwidth to ensure successful integrations and accordingly our business could be harmed or the benefits of our acquisitions may not be realized 

as part of the terms of an acquisition we may commit to pay additional contingent consideration if certain revenue or other performance milestones are met we are required to evaluate the fair value of such commitments at each reporting date and adjust the amount recorded if there are changes to the fair value 

we cannot ensure that we will be successful in selecting executing and integrating acquisitions failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results in addition if stock market analysts or our stockholders do not support or believe in the value of the acquisitions that we choose to undertake our stock price may decline

the conversion condition for the notes due 2024 was met for all quarters ended march 31 2020 through december 31 2020 therefore our notes due 2024 became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on april 1 2020 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2021 accordingly we classified the net carrying amount of the notes due 2024 of 690 million as debt current on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 from january 1 2021 through february 12 2021 we have received the request for conversion of approximately 615 million in principal amount of our notes due 2024 of which we have elected to settle the aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 in a combination of cash and any excess in shares of our common stock in accordance with the applicable indenture such conversion will be settled in march 2021 we may purchase shares under the convertible note hedge to the extent shares of our common stock are issued for the additional conversion amount due over the principal amount from january 1 2021 through february 12 2021 we had not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge and the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding if we receive additional requests for conversion from the holders of the notes due 2024 to exercise their right to convert the debt to equity we have asserted our intent and ability to settle the remaining 266 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 in cash 

the conversion condition for the notes due 2025 was met during the quarter ended december 31 2020 therefore our notes due 2025 became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on january 1 2021 and continue to be convertible through march 31 2021 accordingly we have classified the net carrying amount of the notes due 2025 of 2550 million as debt current on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020

we may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the first quarter of 2021 if more holders elect to convert their notes due 2024 and notes due 2025 in future periods we intend to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation related to the aggregate principal amount in cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition to the extent we receive conversion requests we may also record a loss on early conversions of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2025 converted by note holders based on the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance on the settlement date 

as of december 31 2020 

• 3200 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2025 were outstanding the foregoing collectively the “convertible notes” 

• 881 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 were outstanding and 

• 50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2023 were outstanding the foregoing collectively the “convertible notes” 

the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions in addition the anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock

servicing our debts requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debts 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debts including the convertible notes and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of those activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations including our obligations under the convertible notes 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the convertible notes or repurchase the convertible note upon a fundamental change and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes 

holders of our convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest if any fundamental change is defined in the convertible notes indenture entered into in connection with the financing and consists of events such as an acquisition of a majority of our outstanding common stock an acquisition of our company or substantially all of our assets the approval by our stockholders of a plan of liquidation or dissolution or our common stock no longer being listed on the nasdaq global select market or the nasdaq global market upon conversion of the convertible notes unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make such repurchase of the convertible notes in addition our ability to repurchase the convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the convertible notes may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the relevant indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the relevant indenture would constitute a default under the relevant indenture a default under the indenture or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversion of the convertible notes 

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions andor their early termination may affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with the offering of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions pursuant to which we have the option to purchase approximately the same number of shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 at a price approximately the same as the initial conversion price of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 these transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions to acquire the same number of shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 subject to customary antidilution adjustments at an initial strike price of approximately 8154 per share and 2523 per share for notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 respectively if the market value per share of our common stock as measured under the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants the warrants will have a dilutive effect on the ownership interests of existing stockholders and on our earnings per share unless we elect subject to certain conditions to settle the warrants in cash however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time of settlement 

in addition the existence of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may encourage purchasing and selling share of our common stock or other of our securities and instruments in open market andor privately negotiated transactions in order to modify hedge positions any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024

changes in current accounting methods standards or regulations applicable to the convertible notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 could have a material impact on our reported financial results future financial results future cash flows andor our stock price 

under accounting standards codification “asc” 47020 “debt with conversion and other options” an entity must separately account for the host contract and conversion option associated with convertible debt instruments such as the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost for notes due 2024 conversion option meets the classification of an equity component hence we have included the equity component in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date for notes due 2025 conversion option met the classification of an embedded derivative liability from march 9 2020 to may 19 2020 and hence we had included embedded derivative liability in the debt noncurrent on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date effective upon the filing of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation on may 20 2020 the conversion option of the notes due 2025 met the classification of an equity component hence we reclassified the embedded derivative liability in the debt noncurrent to additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet on may 20 2020 this change in fair value of derivatives has resulted in a charge recognized of 443 million for the year ended december 31 2020 we have treated the value of the equity component and embedded derivative liability as debt discount for the host contract at the issuance date we are required to amortize the debt discount as noncash interest expense over the term of the notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results or the trading price of our common stock 

in addition we use the treasury stock method for convertible debt instruments such as the notes due 2024 since the date of issuance and notes due 2025 since may 20 2020 that may be settled entirely or partly in cash and the effect of which is that any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such notes exceeds their principal amount in august 2020 the fasb issued account standard update “asu” 202006 “debt  debt with conversion and other options subtopic 47020” effective january 1 2022 which requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost interest expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations will be close to the coupon rate interest expense further for the diluted earnings per share calculation treasury stock method will no longer be permitted the ifconverted method will be used for the calculation of the diluted earnings per share calculation when accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2024 and notes due 2025 which will adversely affect our diluted earnings per share 

asu 201615 “statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be classified in the statement of cash flows including the cash settlement for our notes due 2024 and notes due 2025 upon cash settlement repayment of the principal amount will be bifurcated between cash outflows for operating activities for the portion related to accreted interest attributable to debt discounts arising from the difference between the coupon interest rate and the effective interest rate and financing activities for the remainder this will require us to classify the debt discount totaling 364 million for notes due 2024 and 687 million for notes due 2025 of accreted interest as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows upon cash settlement if and when such cash settlement occurs prior to the adoption of asu 202006 discussed above which could adversely affect our future cash flow from operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020 31 million of the debt discount associated with the conversion of 439 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 was classified as cash used in operating activities 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the other risk factors described herein and other factors beyond our control such as quarterly variations in operating results announcements of technology innovations or new products by us or our competitors changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us and new reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance

in addition in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition the trading prices of the securities of solar companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock some of which are beyond our control include 

• seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for our products 

• the timing volume and product mix of sales of our products which may have different average selling prices or profit margins 

• changes in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors 

• the impacts and the evolving effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our business sales and results of operations 

• our ability to design manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and costeffective manner and that meet customer requirements 

• our ability to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers customers and suppliers 

• quality control or yield problems in our manufacturing operations 

• the anticipation announcement or introductions of new or enhanced products by our competitors and ourselves 

• reductions in the retail price of electricity 

• changes in laws regulations and policies applicable to our business and products particularly those relating to government incentives for solar energy applications 

• the impact of tariffs on the solar industry in general and our products in particular 

• unanticipated increases in costs or expenses 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our business operations 

• the impact of governmentsponsored programs on our customers 

• our exposure to the credit risks of our customers particularly in light of the fact that some of our customers are relatively new entrants to the solar market without long operating or credit histories and impacts of the covid19 pandemic they may experience 

• our ability to estimate future warranty obligations due to product failure rates claim rates or replacement costs 

• our ability to forecast our customer demand and manufacturing requirements and manage our inventory 

• fluctuations in our gross profit 

• our ability to predict our revenue and plan our expenses appropriately 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

• changes in our management 

• technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport to macro industry or companyspecific fundamentals including without limitation the sentiment of retail investors including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites the amount and status of short interest in our securities access to margin debt trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging or other technical trading factors 

• general economic conditions and changes in such conditions specific to our target markets and 

• actions by research analysts such as if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock or cease publishing reports about us or our business 

the above factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital or debt financing to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 

• provide additional cash reserves to support our operations 

• invest in our research and development efforts 

• expand our operations into new product markets and new geographies 

• acquire complementary businesses products services or technologies or 

• otherwise pursue our strategic plans and respond to competitive pressures including adjustments to our business to mitigate the effects of any tariffs that might apply to us or our industry 

additionally while we have not repurchased any shares under the plan our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 2000 million of our common stock through open market purchases or through structured repurchase agreements with third parties such purchases are expected to continue through march 2022 unless otherwise extended or shortened by our board of directors 

we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events and opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors collectively own and will continue to own after giving effect to this offering a significant percentage of our common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock and the notes because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to agreed limits on sale volumes and the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act for instance in december in 2018 we filed a resale registration statement related to the approximately 75 million shares of our common stock that were issued to sunpower upon the closing of the apa transaction any sales of securities by sunpower or other stockholders with registration rights could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

manipulative techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock 

short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender short sellers hope to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale as it is in the short seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline some short sellers publish or arrange for the publication of negative opinions regarding the issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short the use of the internet social media and blogging have allowed short sellers to publicly attack a company’s credibility strategy and veracity by means of socalled “research reports” that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by legitimate securities research analysts these short attacks have in the past led to stock price declines and significant selling activity in our common stock issuers with limited trading volumes or substantial retail shareholder bases can be particularly susceptible to higher volatility levels and can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks 

short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental selfregulatory organization or other official authority in the us are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the sec in regulation analyst certification and accordingly the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or in some cases outright fabrications in light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information and the significant profits that can be made from running successful short attacks short sellers have issued such reports on our stock and will likely continue to issue such reports such shortseller attacks may cause our stock to suffer a decline in market price

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition our term loan agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends consequently an investor’s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

• providing for a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors 

• not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates 

• authorizing our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror 

• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders 

• requiring the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 23 of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock voting as a single class to amend provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business our board of directors stockholder action by written consent advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals forum selection and the liability of our directors or to amend our bylaws which may inhibit the ability of stockholders or an acquiror to effect such amendments to facilitate changes in management or an unsolicited takeover attempt 

• requiring special meetings of stockholders may only be called by our chairman of the board if any our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action including the removal of directors and 

• requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 

general risks related to our business 

natural disasters public health events significant disruptions of information technology systems data security breaches or other catastrophic events could adversely affect our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters public health events and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in fremont california is located near major earthquake fault lines and our petaluma california facility is near fault lines and the sites of recent catastrophic wildfires we rely on thirdparty manufacturing facilities including for all product assembly and final testing of our products which are performed at thirdparty manufacturing facilities in china mexico and india there may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate including public health issues for example the ongoing covid19 pandemic or an outbreak of other contagious diseases or health epidemics safety issues natural disasters fire disruptions of service from utilities nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors such risks could result in an increase

further any terrorist attacks material disruption to our information technology systems or any data security breaches including due to cyberattacks especially any aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our cloudbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products or otherwise adverse affect us such significant disruptions of our our third party vendors’ andor business partners’ information technology systems or data security breaches including in our remote work environment as a result of covid19 could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss misappropriation andor unauthorized access use or disclosure of or the prevention of access to confidential information including trade secrets or other intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us any such event that leads to unauthorized access use or disclosure of personal information including personal information regarding our customers could harm our reputation compel us to comply with federal andor state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents subject us to mandatory corrective action require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information which could disrupt our business result in increased costs or loss of revenue andor result in legal and financial exposure in addition security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them may further harm us moreover the prevalent use of mobile devices to access confidential information increases the risk of security breaches while we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business in addition failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and subject us to regulatory scrutiny 

in the event that natural disasters public health epidemics or technical catastrophes were to damage or destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks to our business 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks to our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have in the past reduced demand for solar products for instance the european sovereign debt crisis in recent years has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales internationally

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act has required and will continue to require significant attention of management if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our business is subject to potential tax liabilities 

we are subject to income tax indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax reform act” contained many significant changes to the us federal income tax laws the consequences of which could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future us income tax expense as additional guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as new accounting treatment is clarified we may report additional adjustments in the period if new information becomes available we have a significant amount of deferred tax assets and a portion of the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits could be subject to limitations under the code sections 382 or 383 separate return limitation year rules the limitations could reduce our ability to utilize our net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes tax law changes or the limitations could be material and could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax indirect tax or other tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we cannot be certain that the final determination of our tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be a material adverse effect on our cash tax provisions and net income loss in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles  

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations historically the majority of our revenues are from the north american and european regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends including weather patterns and construction cycles the first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry due to these same factors in the us customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder and wetter months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future

business overview and 2020 highlights 

we are a global energy technology company we deliver smart easytouse solutions that manage solar generation storage and communication on one single platform we revolutionized the solar industry with our microinverter technology and we produce a fully integrated solarplusstorage solution to date we have shipped more than 32 million microinverters and approximately 14 million enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 130 countries 

we sell our solutions primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers we also sell directly to large installers oems strategic partners and homeowners our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted by the scheduled phasedown of the investment tax credit for solar projects under section 48a the “itc” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” 

the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provided a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 which was reduced to a tax credit of 26 for any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through december 31 2022 and 22 thereafter to december 31 2023 before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning on january 1 2024 as a result several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the irs published in june 2018 allowing them to preserve the historical 30 investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after december 31 2019 safe harbor prepayments from customers in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulted in 445 million of revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2020 when we delivered the product 

on march 9 2020 we issued 3200 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2025 the “notes due 2025” in a private placement the notes due 2025 are general unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 025 per year payable semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning on september 1 2020 the notes due 2025 will mature on march 1 2025 unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders further information relating to the notes due 2025 may be found in note 11 “debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and below under the section titled “ liquidity and capital resources”

on march 26 2020 the office of the united states trade representative the “ustr” announced certain exclusion requests related to tariffs on chinese imported microinverter products that fit the dimensions and weight limits within a section 301 tariff exclusion under us note 20ss40 to subchapter iii of chapter 99 of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states the “tariff exclusion” the tariff exclusion applies to covered products under the china section 301 tariff actions “section 301 tariffs” taken by the ustr exported from china to the united states from september 24 2018 until august 7 2020 accordingly we sought refunds totaling approximately 389 million plus approximately 06 million accrued interest on tariffs previously paid from september 24 2018 to march 31 2020 for certain microinverters that qualify for the tariff exclusion the refund request was subject to review and approval by the us customs and border protection therefore we assessed that the probable loss recovery for the year ended december 31 2020 is equal to the approved refund requests available to us prior to issuance of the financial statements on february 12 2021 

as of december 31 2020 we have received 248 million of tariff refunds and accrued for the remaining 147 million tariff refunds that were approved however not yet received on or before december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded 389 million as a reduction to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the approved refunds relate to paid tariffs previously recorded to cost of revenues therefore we recorded the corresponding approved tariff refunds as credits to cost of revenues in the current period for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded the 06 million accrued interest as interest income in our consolidated statement of operations the tariff refund receivable of 147 million is recorded as a reduction of accounts payable to flex ltd and affiliates “flex” our manufacturing partner and the importer of record who will first receive the tariff refunds on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 

the tariff exclusion expired on august 7 2020 and those microinverter products now are subject to tariffs we continue to pay section 301 tariffs on our storage and communication products and other accessories imported from china which are not subject to the tariff exclusion 

in december 2020 holders exchanged 439 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 the principal amount of which was repaid in cash of the 439 million in aggregate principal amount 385 million in aggregate principal amount was settled pursuant to an exchange agreement entered into in december 2020 with certain holders of notes due 2024 we also issued approximately 19 million shares of our common stock to the holders in december 2020 for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the notes due 2024 which were fully offset by shares received from our exercise of the associated note hedging arrangements refer to note 11 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information in connection with the settlement of the notes due 2024 we entered into partial unwind agreements to unwind number of warrants exercisable under our note hedging arrangements and to issue approximately 21 million warrants on a net basis resulting in a net issuance of approximately 19 million shares of our common stock in connection with the exchange of the notes due 2024 

impact of covid19 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to cause disruptions and uncertainties including in the core markets in which we operate the covid19 pandemic has significantly curtailed the movement of people goods and services and had a notable impact on general economic conditions including but not limited to the temporary closures of many businesses “shelter in place” orders and other governmental regulations and reduced consumer spending the most significant nearterm impacts of covid19 on our financial performance are a decline in sales orders as future residential and commercial system owners are canceling sales meetings with system installation professionals or postponing system installations as the purchase of new solar energy management solutions declines as part of the impact of covid19 on consumer spending many businesses through which we distribute our products are working at limited operational capacity the extent of the impact of covid19 on our future operational and financial performance will depend on various future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak impact on our employees impact on our customers effect on our sales cycles or costs and effect on our supply chain and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted but which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition further information relating to the risks and uncertainties related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic may be found in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k

components of consolidated statements of operations 

net revenues 

we primarily generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter solutions and related accessories which include our storage systems our envoy communications gateway and enlighten cloudbased monitoring service as well as other accessories 

our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our solutions and related accessories supply and demand sales incentives and competitive product offerings our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers the diversification and expansion of our revenue base and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs warranty manufacturing personnel and logistics costs freight costs depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs our product costs are impacted by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation certain costs primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future however shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we contract with third parties including one of our contract manufacturers to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the us europe and asia 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product cost product mix customer mix tariff refunds warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality

as of december 31 2020 we had 3990 million in working capital including cash and cash equivalents of 6794 million of which approximately 6592 million were held in the us our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of us government money market mutual funds and both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries we consider amounts held outside the us to be accessible and have provided for the estimated us income tax liability associated with our foreign earnings however our liquidity may be negatively impacted if sales decline significantly for an extended period due to the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic while we have experienced delays in collections from certain customers due to covid19 we believe we will be able to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months further the extent to which the ongoing covid19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto impact our business and liquidity will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be precisely predicted at this time

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates due to risks and uncertainties including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of covid19 as of the date of issuance of these financial statements we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our solutions which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway the cloudbased enlighten monitoring service and storage solutions to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners 

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards codification “asc” no 606 “revenue recognition” “asc 606” or “topic 606” and applied the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of january 1 2018 the most significant impacts upon adoption of topic 606 were how we account for revenue related to our envoy communications device and related enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives are recognized the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred and recognized over the estimated service period 

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services we generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers a description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are as follows 

• products delivered at a point in time we sell our products to customers in accordance with the terms of the related customer contracts we generate revenues from sales of our solutions which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway and enlighten service communications accessories and storage solutions to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners microinverter units microinverter accessories and storage solutions are delivered to customers at a point in time and we recognize revenue for these products when we transfer control of the product to the customer which is generally upon shipment 

• products delivered over time the sale of an envoy communications gateway includes our enlighten cloudbased monitoring service the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred at the sale date and recognized over the estimated service period of 6 years we also sell certain communication accessories that contain a service performance obligation to be delivered over time the revenue from these products is recognized over the related service period which is typically 5 or 12 years 

when we sell a product with more than one performance obligation such as our iq combiner which includes both hardware and envoy the total consideration is allocated to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices we previously sold envoy communications device to certain customers under a longterm financing arrangement under this financing arrangement we net the unbilled receivables against deferred revenue 

we record certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions at the time the related revenue is recorded 

we record upfront contract acquisition costs such as sales commissions to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset for contracts that have a duration of less than one year we follow the topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue

fair value of financial instruments 

the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the carrying amounts of our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments equity investments with readily determinable fair value are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or estimated based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment and are adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer 

convertible note derivatives 

in march 2020 we issued 320 million aggregate principal amount of 025 convertible notes due 2025 concurrently with the issuance of notes due 2025 we entered into privatelynegotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which in combination are intended to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes due 2025 we could not elect to issue the shares of common stock upon settlement of notes due 2025 or convertible note hedge or warrant transactions due to insufficient authorized share capital as a result the embedded conversion option and warrants were accounted for as a derivative liabilities and convertible notes hedge as derivative asset and a gain or loss was reported in other expense net in our consolidated statement of operations to the extent the valuation changed from the date of issuance of notes due 2025 on may 20 2020 at our annual meeting of stockholders the stockholders approved an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the our common stock as a result we are now be able to settle the notes due 2025 convertible notes hedge and warrants through payment or delivery as the case may be of cash shares of its common stock or a combination thereof at our election accordingly on may 20 2020 the embedded derivative liability convertible notes hedge and warrants liability were remeasured at a fair value and were then reclassified to additional paidincapital in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the second quarter of 2020 and are no longer remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification as of december 31 2020 we do not have any convertible note derivatives note 8 “debt” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

warranty obligations 

microinverters and other products sold through december 31 2013 

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units or other products that fail during the product’s warranty term 15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for subsequent generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time  ie failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time  ie claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time  ie replacement cost 

estimated failure rates — our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure “mtfb” estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into operating environments we continue to monitor product performance through our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months when a microinverter fails and is returned we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 



enphase energy inc  2020 form 10k  68 

s 

estimated claim rates — warranty claim rate estimates are based upon observed historical trends and assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 

estimated replacement costs — three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time typically between 15 and 25 years depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

in addition to the key estimates noted above we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates may be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material 

fair value option for microinverters and other products sold since january 1 2014 

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provide us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty under asc 825 “financial instruments” also referred to as the “fair value option” an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years 

we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result the expected present value technique an income approach converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our creditadjusted riskfree rate see note 9 “fair value measurements” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

commitments and contingencies 

in the normal course of business we are subject to loss contingencies and loss recoveries such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business as well as tariff refunds an accrual for a loss contingency or loss recovery is recognized when it is probable and the amount of loss or recovery can be reasonably estimated see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information

business combinations 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles and liabilities acquired also requires the company to make estimates which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset accounting for business acquisitions requires the company to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract meaning that it includes other transaction components this judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction 

intangible assets 

intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 9 years indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis there was no impairment of intangible assets in any of the years presented 

income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as necessary in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities we follow accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes

market risk 

on march 9 2020 we issued 320 million aggregate principal amount of our notes due 2025 and entered into privatelynegotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions which in combination are intended to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes due 2025 and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 8154 to 10694 per share for the period from march 9 2020 through may 19 2020 the notes due 2025 convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could only be settled in cash because the number of authorized and unissued shares of our common stock that was not reserved for other purposes was less than the maximum number of underlying shares that would be required to settle the notes due 2025 convertible note hedge and warrants transactions as such the embedded conversion option associated with the notes due 2025 convertible notes hedge and warrants liability met the criteria for derivative accounting and as a result derivative financial instruments were markedtomarket at each reporting period the volatile market conditions arising from

foreign currency exchange risk 

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure primarily from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros indian rupee and australian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european indian australian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at december 31 2020 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we did not enter into any foreign currency forward contracts during 2020 and 2019 any foreign currency forward contracts entered in the future are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments we maintain a substantial portion of our cash balances in noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits and money market accounts the derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement we mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings we are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes our net revenues are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated potential credit losses 

interest rate risk 

we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 6794 million and 2961 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively consisting of both noninterest bearing and interestbearing deposits and money market accounts such interestearning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk but the risk is limited due to the duration of our short term investments to date fluctuations in interest income have not been significant we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure we have not been exposed to nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates 

our cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited as our notes due 2025 notes due 2024 and notes due 2023 have fixed interest rates of 025 10 and 40 respectively the fair value

of the convertible notes may increase or decrease for various reasons including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions in the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a 30 million noncash loss on settlement of approximately 439 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2024 as a result of the change in fair value based upon the quoted market price as of december 31 2020 the fair value of our notes due 2025 and notes due 2024 was approximately 7255 million and 7471 million respectively notes due 2023 are not actively traded 

a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements 

equity price risk involving minority interest investment in a nonpublic company 

as of december 31 2020 an investment of 50 million in a privatelyheld company is accounted for using the measurement alternative method this strategic equity investment in a third party is subject to risk of changes in market value and could result in realized impairment losses we generally do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in equity investments we monitor these investments for impairment and record reductions in the carrying values when necessary circumstances that indicate an otherthantemporary decline include the valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds decreases in quoted market prices and declines in operations of the issuer there can be no assurance that our equity investment will not face risks of loss in the future

 item 1business 

our company 

we are a global energy technology company  we deliver smart easytouse solutions that manage solar generation storage and communication on one intelligent platform we revolutionized the solar industry with our microinverter technology and we produce a fully integrated solarplusstorage solution  we have shipped more than 25 million microinverters and over one million   enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 130   countries  

we were incorporated as pvi solutions inc in march 2006 in the state of delaware and changed our name to enphase energy inc in july 2007 

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar pv installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems including the following 





enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  4 

 these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

 the solar industry has started its transition from solar only systems to complete energy management solutions which consist of solar plus storage and load control 

our products 

we design develop manufacture and sell home energy solutions that manage energy generation energy storage and control and communications on one intelligent platform we have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductorbased microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies provides advanced energy monitoring and control this is vastly different than a central inverter system using string modules with or without an optimizer approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array the enphase home energy solution with iq™ platform which is our current generation integrated solar storage and energy management offering enables selfconsumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy simplifying design and installation and improving system uptime and reliability the iq family of microinverters like all of our previous microinverters is fully compliant with nec 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements unlike string inverters this capability is builtin with no additional equipment necessary 

the enphase home energy solution with iq™ brings a high technology networked approach to solar generation plus energy storage by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors and cloudbased software technologies our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home’s energy potential while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities the enphase home energy solution with iq uses a single technology platform for seamless management of the whole solution enabling rapid commissioning with the installer toolkit™ consumption monitoring with our envoy™ communications gateway with iq combiner enphase enlighten a cloudbased energy management platform and our enphase ac battery™ system owners can use enphase enlighten to monitor their home’s solar generation energy storage and consumption from any webenabled device unlike some of our competitors who utilize a traditional inverter or offer separate components of solutions we have builtin system redundancy in both pv generation and energy storage eliminating the risk that comes with a singlepoint of failure further the nature of our cloudbased monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates enabling costeffective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance 

the enphase iq 7 micro™ and enphase iq 7 micro™ part of our seventhgeneration iq product family support highpowered 60cell and 72cell solar modules and integrate with alternating current “ac” modules our iq 7x™ product addresses 96cell photovoltaic “pv” modules up to 400w direct current “dc” and with its 975 percent california energy commission “cec” efficiency rating is ideal for integration into high power modules 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  5 

in the third quarter of 2019 we shipped significant volumes of iq 7as™ microinverters to sunpower corporation which integrated our iq 7as into its 66cell next generation technology “ngt” dc modules in november 2019 we began shipping to customers in north america our iq™ 7a microinverters for solar modules up to 450 w targeting highpower residential and commercial applications our customers should be able to pair the iq 7a microinverter with monofacial or bifacial solar modules up to 450 w from solar module manufacturers who are expected to introduce highpower variants of their products in the next three years 

ac module products are integrated systems which allow installers to be more competitive through improved logistics reduced installation times faster inspection and training we began shipping enphase energized™ ac modules in north america in 2017 and continued to make steady progress during 2019 with our ac module partners including sunpower panasonic corporation of north america and solaria corporation 

during the third quarter of 2019 we introduced the enphase iq combiner 3c™ an important component of the enphase home energy solution with iq platform designed to provide an uninterrupted connectivity to the enphase enlighten™ monitoring and service platform 

our nextgeneration iq 8™ system is based upon our always on enphase ensemble™ energy management technology  this system has five components 1 energy generation which is accomplished with the gridagnostic microinverter iq 8 2 energy storage which is achieved by the encharge™ battery with capacities of 34 kwh and 101 kwh 3 microgrid interconnect device mid 4 communication and control via the combiner box with the envoy gateway and 5 enlighten which is the internet of things or iot cloud software 

we started accepting preorders of ensemble technology products which is focused on enabling high capacity storage for north america through our distribution partners in november 2019 storage is enabled by our encharge battery which is a modular 34 kwh solution the modularity allows for ease of installation flexibility and scalability while helping to streamline our supply chain the encharge battery will be available in two variants  34kwh and 101 kwh configuration the 34 kwh battery contains four iq 8 gridagnostic microinverters internally 

after the release of the storage product expected in the first quarter of 2020 we anticipate further revisions of ensemble to be released in 2020 with a focus on iq 8 pv or iq 8 solar installations the advantage of iq 8s on the roof will be that these gridforming microinverters produce power from panels even during blackouts as long as the sun is still shining it addresses a major drawback of traditional solar installations without the need for storage and is differentiated in that respect  

the pure offgrid solution that ensemble technology also addresses started shipping to our partners on iq 8 during the fourth quarter of 2019 

in december 2019 we announced two future products the enphase iq 8d™ for commercial solar purposes an off  grid solar and storage system that are designed to support multiple applications for the indian market

intellectual property 

we operate in an industry in which innovation investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property or ip rights are critical for success we protect our technology through a variety of means including through patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the us and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements as of december 31 2019  we had 233 issued us patents 77 issued foreign patents 43 pending us patent applications and 28 pending foreign counterpart patent applications our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2020 and 2038  

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our custom application specific integrated circuits “asic”s under a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any thirdparty manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market the license carries a 75year term subject to earlier termination upon agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices or cplds and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion and energy storage for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

we own or have rights to various registered trademarks and service marks in the us and in other countries including enphase ensemble envoy and enlighten and rely on both registration of our marks as well as common law protection where available 

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans 

as part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology

seasonality 

historically the majority of our revenues are from the north american and european regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends including weather patterns and construction cycles the first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry due to these same factors although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers and new technology startups the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

 competitors in the inverter market include among others solaredge technologies inc sma solar technology ag huawei technologies co ltd fronius international gmbh ap systems generac yaskawa solectria solar and other companies offering alternative microinverter dctodc optimizer and other power electronic solutions we principally compete with the large incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to our microinverter solution we believe however that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central or string inverter technology even when supplemented by dctodc optimizers competitors in the storage market include solaredge technologies sonnen tesla lg chem sma solar technology ag panasonic delta electronics generac and producers of battery cells and other integrated storage systems 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had 577 fulltime employees of the fulltime employees 245 were engaged in research and development 220 in sales and marketing 64 in general and administration and 48 in manufacturing and operations of these employees 260 were in the united states 192 in india 74 in new zealand 21 in europe 15 in australia 14 in china and 1 in canada

 item 1arisk factors 

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer 

our microinverter and ac battery storage systems are utilized in solar pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model under which businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 





enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  10 

 if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow demand for our customers’ products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology have recently caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of lowercost manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2019  two customers accounted for approximately 21 and 12 of total net revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements generally do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period in addition these customers may decide to no longer use or to reduce the use of our products and services for other reasons that may be out of our control we may also be affected by events impacting our large customers that result in their decreasing their orders with us or impairing their ability to pay for our products the loss of or events affecting one or more of our large customers have had from time to time and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our contract manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which the vast majority of our products are manufactured are located outside of the us we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the us increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  11 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in one of our contract manufacturers’ facilities due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the schedules requested which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes  and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages and changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

component shortages have required us and may continue to require us to incur expedited shipping costs to meet delivery schedules which impacts our revenue and gross profit 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of product lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components of our products for example our asics are purchased from a sole source supplier or developed for us by sole source suppliers any of the solesource and limitedsource suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues stop producing our components cease operations  or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of solesource or limitedsource components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

us government actions with regard to the solar energy sector or international trade could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the current us presidential administration has created and may continue to create regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector generally and the solar energy sector in particular if the administration or the us congress takes action to eliminate or reduce laws regulations and incentives supporting solar energy such actions may result in a decrease in demand for solar energy in the us and other geographical markets which could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations

on september 24 2018 the us began assessing 10 tariffs on certain solar products manufactured in china including our microinverter products and related accessories which are manufactured in china these tariffs increased to 25 in may 2019 such tariffs could have a negative impact on the overall demand for solar products in the us and for our products in particular unless we obtain exemptions or take other actions to avoid them such tariffs will continue to apply to our microinverters and other products such tariffs could hurt the demand for these products and materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining exemptions or that any actions that we may pursue with respect to the organization and operation of our business will effectively mitigate the effects of any tariffs that apply to our business if we are not able to avoid or mitigate the effects of such tariffs the tariffs or mitigating actions we might take could result in material additional costs to us and our suppliers and our results of operations could be negatively impacted as a result 

furthermore a significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries including mexico canada and elsewhere the us mexico and canada are in the process of replacing the north american free trade agreement “nafta” with the united statesmexicocanada agreement “usmca” at this time the final version of the usmca remains unclear if the usmca or any other trade action taken by the administration imposes any additional border tariff or takes any other actions making it more difficult for us to sell our products across international boundaries our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business 

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key personnel in areas such as engineering marketing and sales any of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience if we are not able to continue to attract train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business the progress of our product development programs could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected to help attract retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock purchase plan and nonvested share units restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations also if the value of our stock awards increases substantially this could potentially create substantial personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel in addition any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees

the solar industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and exist ing competitors introduce products which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share 

the market for solar power solutions is highly competitive we compete primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers as well as against new solutions and emerging technologies that directly compete with our business a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our solutions in the modulelevel power electronics market competitors in the inverter market include among others solaredge technologies inc sma solar technology ag huawei technologies co ltd fronius international gmbh abb ltd ap systems generac yaskawa solectria other existing or emerging companies may also begin offering alternative microinverter dctodc optimizer energy storage monitoring and other solutions that compete with our products competitors in the storage market include solaredge technologies sonnen tesla lg chem sma solar technology ag panasonic delta electronics generac and producers of battery cells and other integrated storage systems 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial marketing distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition especially in certain markets in addition some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and creating market awareness for these offerings further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices of our products in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

we also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform dctoac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our systems or sell products that compete with our systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

our recent and planned expansion into existing and new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we currently offer solar microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets throughout the world and we intend to expand into other international markets our success in new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 





enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  14 

 further new geographic markets and larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

 failure to address these new markets successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these markets to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

we may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing 

we are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets we have made investments in our infrastructure increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so any new product is subject to certain risks including component sourcing strategic partner selection and execution customer acceptance competition product differentiation market timing challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow if we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new product introductions these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline projected thus having a materially adverse impact on our revenue operating results and financial stability 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced our eightgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology our new product could be complex requiring requires significant preparation precautionary safety measures timeconsuming string calculations extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment training and knowledge together these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer our installer may not have sufficient resources or expertise necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect which could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  15 

we rely primarily on distributors installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue 

we sell our solutions primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and sales to developers of thirdparty solar finance offerings we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties and as a result many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

in addition while we provide our distributors and installers with training and programs including accreditations and certifications these programs may not be effective or utilized consistently in addition new partners may require extensive training and may take significant time and resources to achieve productivity our partners may subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our partners misrepresent the functionality of our platform or products to customers fail to perform services to our customers’ expectations or violate laws or our corporate policies in addition our partners may utilize our platform to develop products and services that could potentially compete with products and services that we offer currently or in the future concerns over competitive matters or intellectual property ownership could constrain these partnerships if we fail to effectively manage and grow our network of partners or properly monitor the quality and efficacy of their service delivery our ability to sell our products and efficiently provide our services may be impacted and our operating results may be harmed 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

our microinverter systems including our storage solution integrated ac module eighthgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share 

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products including international acceptance of our eighthgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology announced in the fourth quarter of 2019 there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 

 in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central or string inverters or who currently sell dctodc optimizers these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central or string inverter systems or dc optimizers which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our solutions

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries including the us have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs or fits rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions where we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place furthermore electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 





enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  17 

 fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

we are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our gross margins 

the solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time we have reduced the prices of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future including from our major customers in addition we have reduced our prices ahead of planned cost reductions of our products which has adversely affected our gross margins when seeking to maintain or increase their market share our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products in addition our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our gross margins would continue to be adversely affected 

given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological change a principal component of our business strategy is reducing the costs to manufacture our products to remain competitive if our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the efficiency of their products our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency and we may be forced to sell our products at a price lower than our cost further if raw materials costs and other thirdparty component costs were to increase we may not meet our cost reduction targets if we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap we may not be able to remain price competitive which would result in lost market share and lower gross margins 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or coalfired plants or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and depressing sales of our products in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar industry including manufacturers of central inverters and dctodc optimizers could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to increase the cost of installation or operation of solar distributed generation such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our solutions is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory difficulties in planning expenses or disputes with suppliers any of which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material we may also become involved in disputes with our suppliers who may claim that we failed to fulfill forecast or minimum purchase requirements conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and costefficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications 

to date we have generated the majority of our revenues from north america and expect to continue to generate a substantial amount of our revenues from north america in the future there are a number of important incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products a substantial majority of our revenues come from the us which has both federal and state incentives for instance the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provided a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 which is currently reduced to a tax credit of 26 through december 31 2020 and 22 thereafter to december 31 2021 before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning on january 1 2022 these tax credits could be reduced or eliminated as part of tax code changes or regulatory reform initiatives by the current congress and presidential administration 

in addition net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and in some instances modified which may have a negative impact on future inverter sales we derive a significant portion of our revenues from california’s residential solar market and the existing california net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of residential solar power systems future legislative or regulatory changes in california may discourage further growth in the residential solar market 

a number of european countries including germany belgium italy and the united kingdom have adopted reductions in or concluded their net energy metering or fit programs certain countries have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe

we also sell our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a renewable energy target ret that is intended to ensure that 33000 gigawatthours of australia’s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020 this policy supports both the installation of largescale centralized renewable generation projects along with smallscale systems of under 100kw each for residential and small business customers 2018 saw the introduction of statebased incentive schemes aimed at solar customers in the state of victoria and battery storage in the state of south australia other australian states and territories introduced similar programs in 2019 any change in or failure to implement these programs may adversely affect the demand for solar energy solutions in australia 

u  s  federal and state tax credits grants and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception however unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential solar market the phaseout of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy including local content requirements have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business domestically and abroad additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

changes in current laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws and regulations around the world could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or further changes in tariffs export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example several states or territories including california hawaii and queensland australia have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar power systems with which we may not be able to comply in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks for our business 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks for our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have in the past reduced demand for solar products for instance the european sovereign debt crisis in recent years has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales internationally

we have a history of losses which may continue in the future and we cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability 

for the first year since our inception we had net income of 1611 million in the year ended december 31 2019  compared to the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 where we incurred net losses of 116 million and 452 million  respectively we incurred substantial net losses from our inception through the year ended december 31 2018 and we may not be able to sustain profitability and may incur additional losses in the future at december 31 2019  we had an accumulated deficit of 1852 million  our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our offerings increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share future declines in average selling prices of our products the impact of us trade tariffs the imposition of additional tariffs applicable to our industry or our products or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to sustain profitability 

problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to continue to incur additional warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue and gross profit to decline 

we offered 15year limited warranties for our first and second generation microinverters and have offered a limited warranty of up to 25 years on each subsequent generation microinverters including the current generation our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our microinverters under normal use and service conditions for up to 25 years following installation as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized revenue our estimated costs of warranty for previously sold products may change depending on a number of factors including failure rates and cost of providing replacement products  

while we offer warranties of up to 25 years our microinverters have only been in use since mid2008 when we first commenced commercial sales of our products although we conduct accelerated life cycle testing to measure performance and reliability our solutions have not been tested over the full warranty cycle and do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life in addition under realworld operating conditions which may vary by location and design as well as insolation soiling and weather conditions a typical solar pv installation may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions if our products perform below expectations or have unexpected reliability problems we may be unable to gain or retain customers and could face substantial warranty expense 

we are required to make assumptions and apply judgments based on our accelerated life cycle testing and the limited operating history of our products regarding a number of factors including the durability and reliability of our products our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the costs of replacement of defective products our assumptions have proved and could in the future prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our products which has caused and may in the future cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products increases in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to actual product failure rates field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting product failures have caused and could in the future cause us to materially increase the amount of warranty obligations and have had and may have in the future a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations 

we also depend significantly on our reputation for reliability and highquality products and services exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business if our products and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired and we may lose or be unable to gain or retain customers

defects and poor performance in our products could result in loss of customers decreased revenue and unexpected expenses and increases in warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

our products must meet stringent quality requirements and may contain undetected errors or defects especially when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product these errors or defects may be dangerous as defective power components may cause power overloads potentially resulting in explosion or fire as we develop new generations of our products and enter new markets we face higher risk of undetected defects because our testing protocols may not be able to fully test the products under all possible operating conditions in the past we have experienced defects in our products due to errors in the manufacturing and design process any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts in order to address or remedy any defects  and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

furthermore defective inefficient or poorly performing power components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim also we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain this coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty and product liability claims or product recalls may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our installers and enduser customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems may contain undetected errors failures or bugs especially when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our monitoring service could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses 

natural disasters public health events terrorist or cyberattacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters public health events and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in fremont california is located near major earthquake fault lines and our petaluma california facility is near fault lines and the sites of recent catastrophic wild fires further a terrorist attack or cyberattack including one aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our cloudbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products in the event that an earthquake fire tsunami typhoon terrorist or cyberattack or other natural manmade or technical catastrophe were to damage or destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

we rely on thirdparty manufacturing facilities including for all product assembly and final testing of our products which is performed at thirdparty manufacturing facilities in china and mexico there may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate including public health issues for example an outbreak of a contagious disease such as 2019novel coronavirus 2019ncov avian influenza measles or ebola safety issues natural disasters fire disruptions of service from utilities nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors any of the above risks should they occur could result in an increase in the cost of components production delays general business interruptions delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs and other barriers and restrictions longer payment cycles increased taxes restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  22 

we could be subject to breaches of our in formation technology systems which could cause significant reputational legal and financial damages 

like many companies we use and store a wide variety of confidential and proprietary information relating to our business although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology and related systems and have implemented measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

we devote substantial resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security the techniques used in attempted cyberattacks and intrusions are sophisticated and constantly evolving and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures although to date we have not experienced breaches of our systems that have had a material adverse effect on our business attacks and intrusions on our systems will continue and we may experience a breach of our systems that compromises sensitive company information or customer data in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to reputational damage and significant costs including to rebuild our systems modify our products and services defend litigation respond to government enforcement actions pay damages or take other remedial steps any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may also share information with contractors and thirdparty providers to conduct our business although such contractors and thirdparty providers typically implement encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data those thirdparty providers may experience a significant data security breach which may also detrimentally affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

in may 25 2018 the european union or eu implemented the general data protection regulation or gdpr a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current eu data protection law to noneuropean union entities that process or control the processing of the personal information of eu subjects the gdpr allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of eu subjects including through a data security breach in june 2018 the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa which contains requirements similar to gdpr for the handling of personal information of california residents which became effective in january 2020 the ccpa establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for california residents the ccpa includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action the ccpa requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers as that word is broadly defined in the ccpa provide such consumers new ways to optout of certain sales of personal information and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches it remains unclear how the ccpa will be interpreted but as currently written it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data as we expand our operations the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability some observers have noted that the ccpa could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states other states are beginning to pass similar laws

our and our collaborators’ and contractors’ failure to fully comply with gdpr ccpa and other laws could lead to significant fines and require onerous corrective action in addition data security breaches experienced by us our collaborators or contractors could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property public disclosure of sensitive commercial data and the exposure of personally identifiable information including sensitive personal information of our employees customers collaborators and others compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and timeintensive process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules furthermore the laws are not consistent and compliance with various different requirements may be costly if we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information was to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the us and in other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade secrets copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof  or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business

we may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business in addition our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our installers and enduser customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems is dependent on cloudbased hosting services along with the availability of wifi or mobile data services at enduser premises a disruption infiltration or failure of our information technology systems thirdparty cloud hosting platforms or enduser data services as a result of software or hardware malfunctions system implementations or upgrades computer viruses cyberattacks thirdparty security breaches employee error theft or misuse malfeasance power disruptions natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security failure of our enlighten service loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner customer and employee personal data we have been and may in the future be subject to fraud attempts from outside parties through our electronic systems such as “phishing” email communications to our finance technical or other personnel which could put us at risk for harm from fraud theft or other loss if our internal controls do not operate as intended any of these events could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the failure to successfully integrate our products with those of sunpower could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in august 2018 we entered into a master supply agreement “msa” with sunpower from whom we also purchased certain intellectual property and other assets as part of the asset purchase agreement “apa” transaction our failure to successfully integrate our microinverter products and software with sunpower’s solar modules could frustrate the purposes of our acquisition of sunpower’s assets negatively impact our revenue projections impair goodwill intangible assets recognized and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as part of the apa transaction we recognized 362 million of finitelived intangible assets for developed technology and customer relationship and 211 million of goodwill we make assumptions and estimates in this assessment which are complex and often subjective our judgement and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts to the extent that the factors described above change we could be required to record additional noncash impairment charges in the future which could negatively affect our results of operations 

we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the sunpower transaction which may result in conflicts between us and sunpower 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the sunpower transaction will depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully execute the terms of the msa which could be a complex and timeconsuming process any delay failure or breach of obligations under the msa could adversely impact the expected benefits of the transaction and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally in connection with the apa transaction sunpower acquired 75 million shares of our common stock and has the right to designate one member of our board of directors through its share ownership and board seat sunpower may have the ability to directly or indirectly influence our business and conflicts may arise between us and sunpower regarding corporate priorities and strategic objectives as of december 31 2019  sunpower held 65 million shares of the our common stock 

future acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may in the future seek to expand our business through further acquisitions and strategic transactions such transactions involve a number of risks that could harm our business or result in us not achieving anticipated benefits including issues with integrating acquired businesses the diversion of management time and attention failures in due diligence or in identifying financial and legal liabilities and other risks transaction related impairments or financial charges and the assumption of liabilities in our future transactions we may also decide to pay all or a portion of the transaction consideration through dilutive equity issuances and our future acquisitions may require significant reductions in our available cash or the incurrence of indebtedness all of which could harm our operating results

if we are unable to effectively manage our operations our business and operating results may suffer 

we have experienced and expect to experience in the future volatility in our sales and operations our historical growth and our more recent cost reduction initiatives have placed and are expected to continue to place significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources to 

 we cannot assure you that our current and planned operations personnel systems internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations if we cannot manage our sales and operations effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into new jurisdictions through internal growth or acquisitions requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards although we implement policies and procedures and conduct training designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws thereby mitigating the risk of violations of such laws our employees subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

ordering patterns from our distributors may cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period 

our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their assessment of endcustomer demand and their forecasts because these forecasts may not be accurate channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly due to the difference between their forecasts and actual demand as a result distributors may adjust their purchase orders placed with us in response to changing channel inventory levels as well as their assessment of the latest market demand trends in addition our distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins and operating results 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  26 

further we have limited visibility into future end customer demand a significant decrease in our distributors’ channel inventory in one period may lead to a significant rebuilding of channel inventory in subsequent periods or vice versa which may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly this fluctuation may cause our results to fall short of analyst or investor expectations in a certain period which may cause our stock price to decline 

if potential owners of solar pv systems based on our product platform are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms we could experience a reduction in the demand for our solar pv systems 

many owners of solar pv systems depend on financing to purchase their systems the limited use of microinverters to date coupled with our relatively smaller size and capitalization compared to some of our competitors could result in lenders refusing to provide the financing necessary to purchase solar pv systems based on our product platform on favorable terms or at all moreover in the case of debt financed projects even if lenders are willing to finance the purchase of these systems an increase in interest rates or a change in tax incentives could make it difficult for owners to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all in addition we believe that a significant percentage of owners purchase solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of upfront cash and financing difficulties in obtaining financing for solar pv systems on favorable terms or increases in interest rates or changes in tax incentives could lower an investor’s return on investment in a solar pv system or make alternative solar pv systems or other investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems based on our product platform any of these events could result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant share of residential solar installations has been provided through thirdparty financing structures such as power purchase or lease agreements our sales growth may depend on sales to developers of thirdparty solar finance offerings who provide solar as a service via power purchase agreements or leasing structures the thirdparty finance market for residential solar in the us and elsewhere is or may become highly concentrated with a few significant finance companies and several smaller entrants if we are unable develop relationships and gain a significant share of inverter sales to the major finance companies or new entrants our overall sales growth could be constrained 

our success in “ac module” versions of our microinverter system will depend in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers 

we continue to work on variants of our microinverter systems that enable direct attachment of a microinverter to solar modules the market success of such “ac module” solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with sunpower and other solar module manufacturers to design microinverters that are compatible with such direct attachment to solar modules we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial challenges faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules and the tariffs in the us 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against our competitors we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources  and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe upon any intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the us and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent applications an adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 





enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  27 

 any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

we have licensed and in the future we may choose or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development and marketing of our products we cannot assure that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software  since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis  or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code any of the above could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles 

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations particularly in climates that experience colder or rainier weather during the winter months such as northern europe canada and the us in general we expect our products in the second third and fourth quarters will be positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles preceded by a seasonally softer first quarter in the us customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder and wetter months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

in august 2018 we issued and sold a total of 650 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2023 the “ notes due 2023 ” in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and an affiliate of the company in may 2019 we entered into separately and privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the notes due 2023 resulting in the repurchase and exchange of 600 million aggregate principal amount of the notes in consideration for the issuance of shares of common stock and separate cash payments as of december 31 2019  50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes due 2023 were outstanding 

in june 2019 we issued and sold a total of 1320 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2024 the “ notes due 2024 ” and together with the notes due 2023  the “ convertible notes ” 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  28 

the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions in addition the anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

servicing our debts requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debts 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes  depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debts including the convertible notes  and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes  will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of those activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations including our obligations under the convertible notes  

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change or to repay the notes due 2024 and the notes due 2023 at maturity 

holders of our notes due 2024 will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at 100 of the principal amount of the notes due 2024  plus accrued and unpaid interest fundamental change is defined in the notes due 2024 indenture entered into in connection with the notes due 2024 financing and consists of events such as an acquisition of a majority of our outstanding common stock an acquisition of our company or substantially all of our assets the approval by our stockholders of a plan of liquidation or dissolution or our common stock no longer being listed on the nasdaq global select market or the nasdaq global market we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make such repurchase of the notes due 2024  

similarly holders of our notes due 2023 will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at 100 of the principal amount of the notes due 2023  plus accrued and unpaid interest fundamental change is defined in the notes due 2023 indenture entered into in connection with the notes due 2023 financing and consists of events such as an acquisition of a majority of our outstanding common stock an acquisition of our company or substantially all of our assets the approval by our stockholders of a plan of liquidation or dissolution or our common stock no longer being listed on the nasdaq global select market or the nasdaq global market moreover we will be required to repay the notes due 2023 in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the notes due 2023 surrendered or repay the notes due 2023 at maturity 

if we do not have enough available cash at the time we are required to make the required repurchases of the convertible notes  we may be required to undertake one or more actions such as selling assets attempting to restructure the convertible notes or other debt or obtaining additional capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions andor their early termination may affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with the offering of the notes due 2024  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions pursuant to which we have the option to purchase approximately the same number of shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2024  at a price approximately the same as the initial conversion price of the notes due 2024  these transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes due 2024  separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions to acquire the same number of shares of our common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2024 subject to customary antidilution adjustments at an initial strike price of approximately 2523 per share if the market value per share of our common stock as measured under the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants the warrants will have a dilutive effect on the ownership interests of existing stockholders and on our earnings per share unless we elect subject to certain conditions to settle the warrants in cash however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time of settlement 

in addition the existence of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may encourage purchasing and selling share of our common stock or other of our securities and instruments in open market andor privately negotiated transactions in order to modify hedge positions any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes due 2024  

changes in current accounting methods standards or regulations applicable to the convertible notes due 2024 coul d have a material impact on our reported financial results future financial results future cash flows andor our stock price  

under accounting standards codification “asc” 47020 “debt with conversion and other options” an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments such as the notes due 2024  that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost accordingly we have included the equity component in the additional paidin capital section of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and we have treated the value of the equity component as debt discount for the liability component we are required to amortize the debt discount as noncash interest expense over the term of the notes due 2024  which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results or the trading price of our common stock 

in addition we use the treasury stock method for convertible debt instruments such as the notes due 2024  that may be settled entirely or partly in cash and the effect of which is that any shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such notes exceeds their principal amount under the treasury stock method for diluted earnings per share purposes the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess conversion value if we elected to settle such excess in shares are issued we cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit use of the treasury stock method if we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes due 2024  then our diluted earnings per share will be adversely affected  

accounting standards update “asu” 201615 “statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be classified in the statement of cash flows including the cash settlement for our notes due 2024  upon cash settlement repayment of the principal amount will be bifurcated between cash outflows for operating activities for the portion related to accreted interest attributable to debt discounts arising from the difference between the coupon interest rate and the effective interest rate and financing activities for the remainder this will require us to classify the 364 million of accreted interest as cash used in operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows upon cash settlement which could adversely affect our future cash flow from operations 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital or debt financing to execute on our current or future business strategies including to

 we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events and opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act has required and will continue to require significant attention of management we are required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act in conjunction with this annual report on form 10k if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

o ur business is subject to potential tax liabilities 

we are subject to income tax indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax reform act contains many significant changes to the us federal income tax laws which the consequences of which could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future us income tax expense as additional guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as new accounting treatment is clarified we may report additional adjustments in the period if new information becomes available we have a significant amount of deferred tax assets and a portion of the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits could be subject to limitations under the internal revenue code section 382 or 383 separate return loss year rules the limitations could reduce our ability to utilize our net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes tax law changes or the limitations could be material and could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate  

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax indirect tax or other tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be a material adverse effect on our cash tax provisions and net income loss in the period or periods for which that determination is made

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a costefficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america europe australia and other markets we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation  or are otherwise required to continue to substitute more expensive air transportation to meet delivery time requirements our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k  and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control in addition the trading prices of the securities of solar companies in general have been highly volatile and the volatility in market price and trading volume of securities is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities factors affecting the market price of our common stock some of which are beyond our control include

 the above factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

techniques employed by manipulative short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock 

short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender short sellers hope to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale as it is in the short seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline some short sellers publish or arrange for the publication of negative opinions regarding the issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short the use of the internet social media and blogging have allowed short sellers to publicly attack a company’s credibility strategy and veracity by means of socalled “research reports” that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by legitimate securities research analysts these short attacks have in the past led to stock price declines and significant selling activity in our common stock issuers with limited trading volumes or substantial retail shareholder bases can be particularly susceptible to higher volatility levels and can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks 

short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental selfregulatory organization or other official authority in the us are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the sec in regulation ac regulation analyst certification and accordingly the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or in some cases outright fabrications in light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information and the significant profits that can be made from running successful short attacks short sellers will likely continue to issue such reports such shortseller attacks may cause our stock to suffer a decline in market price

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors collectively own a significant percentage of our common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of o ur common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to agreed limits on sale volumes and the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act for instance in december in 2018 we filed a resale registration statement related to 75 million shares of our common stock that were issued to sunpower upon the closing of the apa transaction any sales of securities by sunpower or other stockholders with registration rights could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition our term loan agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends consequently an investor’s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 





enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  34 

 in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

we are a global energy technology company  we deliver smart easytouse solutions that manage solar generation storage and communication on one intelligent platform we revolutionized the solar industry with our microinverter technology and we produce a fully integrated solarplusstorage solution  we have shipped more than 25 million microinverters and over one million   enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in more than 130   countries  

we sell our solutions primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers we also sell directly to large installers oems strategic partners and homeowners our revenue for the second half of 2019 was positively impacted by the scheduled phasedown of the investment tax credit for solar projects under section 48a the “itc” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” the historical itc percentage was 30 through 2019 and the itc percentage decreased to 26 of the basis of a solar energy system that began construction during 2020 22 for 2021 and zero for residential and 10 for commercial if construction begins after 2021 or if the solar energy system is placed into service after 2023 as a result several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the irs published in june 2018 allowing them to preserve the historical 30 investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after december 31 2019  these safe harbor purchases positively affected our revenues in the second half of 2019 and 499 million deferred revenue as of december 31 2019 relates to safe harbor purchases to be shipped in the first quarter of 2020

the launch of our iq 7 series microinverter worldwide the smallest lightest and most powerful microinverter we have ever made was a key factor in improving gross margin every region of the world where our products are sold is now using this seventhgeneration microinverter during year ended december 31 2019  98 of our microinverter shipments were iq 7 we systematically rolled out highpower and highefficiency variants of the iq 7 microinverters in 2018 selling these variants simultaneously improved gross margin and delivered a better price per watt for the installer

the notes due 2024 may be converted on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding december 1 2023 in multiples of 1000 principal amount at the option of the holder under any of the following circumstances 1 during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on september 30 2019 and only during such calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of the our common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 266513  130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day 2 during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the “measurement period” in which the “trading price” as defined in the relevant indenture per 1000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of the our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day or 3 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events upon conversion of any of the notes we will pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock at our election

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our solutions which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway the cloudbased enlighten monitoring service and ac battery storage solutions to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners 

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards codification “asc” no 606 “revenue recognition” “asc 606” or “topic 606” and applied the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of january 1 2018 the most significant impacts upon adoption of topic 606 were how we account for revenue related to our envoy communications device and related enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives are recognized the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred and recognized over the estimated service period 

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services we generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers a description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are as follows 

 we previously sold envoy communications device to certain customers under a longterm financing arrangement under this financing arrangement we net the unbilled receivables against deferred revenue 

we record certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions at the time the related revenue is recorded 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  49 

we record upfront contract acquisition costs such as sales commissions to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset for contracts that have a duration of less than one year we follow the topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue 

see note 3  “ revenue recognition ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to revenue recognition 

inventory 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market market is current replacement cost by purchase or by reproduction dependent on the type of inventory in cases where market exceeds net realizable value  ie  estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal inventories are stated at net realizable value market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin we determine cost on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory including customer demand and market conditions management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2019  2018 and 2017 were not material 

warranty obligations 

microinverters sold through december 31 2013 

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product’s warranty term  15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for third and fourth generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time  ie failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time  ie claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time  ie replacement cost 

estimated failure rates — our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure “mtfb” estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into operating environments we continue to monitor product performance through our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months  when a microinverter fails and is returned we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 

estimated claim rates — warranty claim rate estimates are based upon observed historical trends and assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  50 

estimated replacement costs — three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time typically between 15 and 25 years  depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

in addition to the key estimates noted above we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates may be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material 

fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1 2014 

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provide us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty under asc 825 “financial instruments” also referred to as the “fair value option” an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years  

we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result the expected present value technique an income approach converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our creditadjusted riskfree rate see note 9  “ fair value measurements ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

business combinations 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles and liabilities acquired also requires the company to make estimates which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset accounting for business acquisitions requires the company to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract meaning that it includes other transaction components this judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  51 

intangible assets 

intangible assets include patents and other purchased intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 9 years  indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and are also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis there was no impairment of intangible assets in any of the years presented 

income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets to determine release of valuation allowance as necessary in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities we follow accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 




 item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure primarily from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros indian rupee and australian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european indian australian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we did not enter into any foreign currency forward contracts during 2019 and 2018 any foreign currency forward contracts entered in the future are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

credit risk 

financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable we maintain a substantial portion of our cash balances in noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits and money market accounts we believe that these financial institutions are financially sound and accordingly are subject to minimal credit risk our net revenues are primarily concentrated among a limited number 



enphase energy inc  2019 form 10k  52 

of customers we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated potential credit losses see note 16 for information on concentration of “credit risk and major customers” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

interest rate risk 

we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 2961 million and 1062 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively consisting of both noninterest bearing and interestbearing deposits and money market accounts such interestearning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk but the risk is limited due to the duration of our short term investments to date fluctuations in interest income have not been significant we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure we have not been exposed to nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates 

our cash flow exposure due to changes in interest rates related to our debt is limited as our notes due 2024 and notes due 2023 have fixed interest rates of 10 and 40  respectively the fair value of the convertible notes may increase or decrease for various reasons including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions based upon the quoted market price as of december 31 2019  the fair value of our notes due 2024 was approximately 1909 million  notes due 2023 are not actively traded

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar pv installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter as compared to microinverter systems we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar systems including the following 



–   4  – 

 these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our asics under a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any thirdparty manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market the license carries a 75year term subject to earlier termination upon agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices or cplds and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

–   9  – 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans 

as part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology 

seasonality 

historically the majority of our revenues are from the north american and european regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends including weather patterns and construction cycles the first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry due to these same factors although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers and new technology startups the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 



–   10  – 

competitors in the inverter market include among others solaredge technologies inc sma solar technology ag huawei technologies co ltd fronius international gmbh and abb ltd   and other companies offering alternative microinverter dctodc optimizer and other power electronic solutions we principally compete with the large incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to our microinverter solution we believe however that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central or string inverter technology even when supplemented by dctodc optimizers competitors in the storage market include producers of battery cells and other integrated storage systems 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had 427  fulltime employees of the fulltime employees 179  were engaged in research and development 157  in sales and marketing 51  in general and administration and 40  in manufacturing and operations of these employees 195  were in the united states 140  in india 48  in new zealand 21  in europe 16  in australia 6  in china and 1  in canada 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in france are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1arisk factors 

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

us government actions with regard to the solar energy sector or international trade could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the current us presidential administration has created and may continue to create regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector generally and the solar energy sector in particular if the administration or the us congress takes action to eliminate or reduce legislation regulations and incentives supporting solar energy such actions may result in a decrease in demand for solar energy in the us and other geographical markets which could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

–   11  – 

on september 24 2018 the us began assessing 10 tariffs on our microinverter products and related accessories which are manufactured in china these tariffs are expected to increase to 25 on march 1 2019 such tariffs could have a negative impact on the overall demand for solar products in the us and for our products in particular unless we obtain exemptions or take other actions to avoid them such tariffs will continue to apply to our microinverters and other products such tariffs could hurt the demand for these products and materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining exemptions or that any actions that we may pursue with respect to the organization and operation of our business will effectively mitigate the effects of any tariffs that apply to our business if we are not able to avoid or mitigate the effects of such tariffs the tariffs or mitigating actions we might take could result in material additional costs to us and our suppliers and our results of operations could be negatively impacted as a result 

furthermore a significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries including mexico canada and elsewhere the us mexico and canada are in the process of replacing the north american free trade agreement “nafta” with the united statesmexicocanada agreement “usmca” at this time the final version of the usmca remains unclear if the usmca or any other trade action taken by the administration imposes any additional border tariff or takes any other actions making it more difficult for us to sell our products across international boundaries our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer 

our microinverter and ac battery storage systems are utilized in solar pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model under which businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 



–   12  – 

 if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow demand for our customers’ products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology have recently caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of lowercost manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2018  one   customer  accounted for approximately 19  of total net revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements generally do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period in addition these customers may decide to no longer use or to reduce the use of our products and services for other reasons that may be out of our control we may also be affected by events impacting our large customers that result in their decreasing their orders with us or impairing their ability to pay for our products the loss of or events affecting one or more of our large customers have had could have and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to successfully integrate our products with those of sunpower could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

on august 9 2018 we entered into a msa with sunpower from whom we also purchased certain intellectual property and other assets as part of the asset purchase agreement “apa” transaction our failure to successfully integrate our microinverter products and software with sunpower’s solar modules could frustrate the purposes of our acquisition of sunpower’s assets negatively impact our revenue projections and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the sunpower transaction which may result in conflicts between us and sunpower 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the sunpower transaction will depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully execute the terms of the msa which could be a complex and timeconsuming process any delay failure or breach of obligations under the msa could adversely impact the expected benefits of the transaction and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally in connection with the apa transaction sunpower acquired 75 million  shares of our common stock and has the right to designate one member of our board of directors through its share ownership and board seat sunpower may have the ability to directly or indirectly influence our business and conflicts may arise between us and sunpower regarding corporate priorities and strategic objectives 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers and our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our contract manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price 

–   13  – 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which the vast majority of our products are manufactured are located outside of the us we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the us increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in our contract manufacturer’s facility due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the schedules requested which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes   and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages and changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

component shortages have required us and may continue to require us to incur expedited shipping costs to meet delivery schedules which impacts our revenue and gross profit 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of product lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

–   14  – 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components of our products for example our asics are purchased from a sole source supplier or developed for us by sole source suppliers any of the solesource and limitedsource suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues stop producing our components cease operations   or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of solesource or limitedsource components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business 

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel any of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled personnel is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business if we fail to retain existing or recruit new senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business could suffer 

future acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may in the future seek to expand our business through further acquisitions and strategic transactions such transactions involve a number of risks that could harm our business or result in us not achieving anticipated benefits including issues with integrating acquired businesses the diversion of management time and attention failures in due diligence or in identifying financial and legal liabilities and other risks transaction related impairments or financial charges and the assumption of liabilities in our future transactions we may also decide to pay all or a portion of the transaction consideration through dilutive equity issuances and our future acquisitions may require significant reductions in our available cash or the incurrence of indebtedness all of which could harm our operating results 

–   15  – 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

we have a history of losses which may continue in the future and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability 

we have incurred substantial net losses since our inception and we may continue to incur additional losses in the future for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we incurred net losses of 116 million  452 million  and 675 million  respectively at december 31 2018  we had an accumulated deficit of 3463 million  our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our offerings increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share future declines in average selling prices of our products the impact of us trade tariffs established in 2018 and expected to increase in 2019 the imposition of additional tariffs applicable to our industry or our products or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

–   16  – 

we are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our gross margins 

the solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time we have reduced the prices of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future including from our major customers in addition we have reduced our prices ahead of planned cost reductions of our products which has adversely affected our gross margins when seeking to maintain or increase their market share our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products in addition our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our gross margins would continue to be adversely affected 

given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological change a principal component of our business strategy is reducing the costs to manufacture our products to remain competitive if our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the efficiency of their products our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency and we may be forced to sell our products at a price lower than our cost further if raw materials costs and other thirdparty component costs were to increase we may not meet our cost reduction targets if we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap we may not be able to remain price competitive which would result in lost market share and lower gross margins 

the solar industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and exist ing competitors introduce products which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share 

the market for solar power solutions is highly competitive to date we have competed primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers but as the solar industry rapidly grows new solutions and technologies are emerging that will directly compete with our business a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our solutions in the modulelevel power electronics market competitors in the inverter market include among others solaredge technologies inc sma solar technology ag huawei technologies co ltd fronius international gmbh and abb ltd  other existing or emerging companies may also begin offering alternative microinverter dctodc optimizer energy storage monitoring and other solutions that compete with our products 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial marketing distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition especially in certain markets in addition some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and creating market awareness for these offerings further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices of our products in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

we also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform dctoac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our systems or sell products that compete with our systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

–   17  – 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

our pv systems including our storage solution integrated ac module eighthgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share 

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products including international acceptance of our anticipated eighthgeneration iq microinverters and ensemble technology there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 

 in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central or string inverters or who currently sell dctodc optimizers these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central or string inverter systems or dc optimizers which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our solutions 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries including the us have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs or fits rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy 

–   18  – 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions where we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place furthermore electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory difficulties in planning expenses or disputes with suppliers any of which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material we may also become involved in disputes with our suppliers who may claim that we failed to fulfill forecast or minimum purchase requirements conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and costefficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications 

to date we have generated the majority of our revenues from north america and expect to continue to generate a substantial amount of our revenues from north america in the future there are a number of important incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products a substantial majority of our revenues come from the us which has both federal and state incentives for instance the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 currently provides a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 and reduced tax credits of 26 and 22 through december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning in 2022 these tax credits could be reduced or eliminated as part of tax code changes or regulatory reform initiatives by the current congress and presidential administration 

–   19  – 

in addition net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and in some instances modified which may have a negative impact on future inverter sales we derive a significant portion of our revenues from california’s residential solar market and the existing california net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of residential solar systems future legislative or regulatory changes in california may discourage further growth in the residential solar market 

a number of european countries including germany belgium italy and the united kingdom have adopted reductions in or concluded their net energy metering or fit programs certain countries have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe 

we also sell our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a renewable energy target ret that is intended to ensure that 33000 gigawatthours of australia’s electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020 this policy supports both the installation of largescale centralized renewable generation projects along with smallscale systems of under 100kw each for residential and small business customers 2018 saw the introduction of statebased incentive schemes aimed at solar customers in the state of victoria and battery storage in the state of south australia other australian states and territories are expected to introduce similar programs in 2019 any change in or failure to implement these programs may adversely affect the demand for solar energy solutions in australia 

u  s   federal and state tax credits grants and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception however unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential solar market the phaseout of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy including local content requirements have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business domestically and abroad additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

changes in current laws or regulations   or the imposition of new laws and regulations around the world could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or further changes in tariffs export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example several states or territories including california hawaii and queensland australia have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar systems with which we may not be able to comply in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks for our business 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks for our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have in the past reduced demand for solar products for instance the european sovereign debt crisis in recent years has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales internationally 

natural disasters terrorist or cyberattacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in fremont california is located near major earthquake fault lines and our petaluma california facility is near fault lines and the sites of recent catastrophic wild fires further a terrorist attack or cyberattack including one aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our cloudbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products in the event that an earthquake fire tsunami typhoon terrorist or cyberattack or other natural manmade or technical catastrophe were to damage or destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

we could be subject to breaches of our in formation technology systems which could cause significant reputational legal and financial damages 

like many companies we use and store a wide variety of confidential and proprietary information relating to our business although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology and related systems and have implemented measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 

we devote substantial resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security the techniques used in attempted cyberattacks and intrusions are sophisticated and constantly evolving and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures although to date we have not experienced breaches of our systems that have had a material adverse effect on our business attacks and intrusions on our systems will continue and we may experience a breach of our systems that compromises sensitive company information or customer data in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security if we experience a significant data security breach we could be exposed to reputational damage and significant costs including to rebuild our systems modify our products and services defend litigation respond to government enforcement actions pay damages or take other remedial steps any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may also share information with contractors and thirdparty providers to conduct our business although such contractors and thirdparty providers typically implement encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data those thirdparty providers may experience a significant data security breach which may also detrimentally affect our business results of operations and financial condition

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

effective may 25 2018 the european union or eu implemented the general data protection regulation or gdpr a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current eu data protection law to noneuropean union entities that process or control the processing of the personal information of eu subjects the gdpr allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of eu subjects including through a data security breach on june 27 2018 the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa which contains requirements similar to gdpr for the handling of personal information of california residents commencing on january 1 2020 

our and our collaborators’ and contractors’ failure to fully comply with gdpr ccpa and other laws could lead to significant fines and require onerous corrective action in addition data security breaches experienced by us our collaborators or contractors could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property public disclosure of sensitive commercial data and the exposure of personally identifiable information including sensitive personal information of our employees customers collaborators and others 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information was to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business in addition our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our installers and enduser customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems is dependent on cloudbased hosting services along with the availability of wifi or mobile data services at enduser premises a disruption infiltration or failure of our information technology systems thirdparty cloud hosting platforms or enduser data services as a result of software or hardware malfunctions system implementations or upgrades computer viruses cyberattacks thirdparty security breaches employee error theft or misuse malfeasance power disruptions natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security failure of our enlighten service loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner customer and employee personal data we have been and may in the future be subject to fraud attempts from outside parties through our electronic systems such as “phishing” email communications to our finance technical or other personnel which could put us at risk for harm from fraud theft or other loss if our internal controls do not operate as intended any of these events could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or coalfired plants or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and depressing sales of our products in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar industry including manufacturers of central inverters and dctodc optimizers could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to increase the cost of installation or operation of solar distributed generation such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our solutions is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to continue to incur additional warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue and gross profit to decline 

we offered 15year limited warranties for our first and second generation microinverters and have offered a limited warranty of up to 25 years on each subsequent generation microinverters including the current generation our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our microinverters under normal use and service conditions for up to 25 years following installation as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized revenue our estimated costs of warranty for previously sold products may change depending on a number of factors including failure rates and cost of providing replacement products  

while we offer warranties of up to 25 years our microinverters have only been in use since mid2008 when we first commenced commercial sales of our products although we conduct accelerated life cycle testing to measure performance and reliability our solutions have not been tested over the full warranty cycle and do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life in addition under realworld operating conditions which may vary by location and design as well as insolation soiling and weather conditions a typical solar pv installation may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions if our products perform below expectations or have unexpected reliability problems we may be unable to gain or retain customers and could face substantial warranty expense 

we are required to make assumptions and apply judgments based on our accelerated life cycle testing and the limited operating history of our products regarding a number of factors including the durability and reliability of our products our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the costs of replacement of defective products our assumptions have proved and could in the future prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our products which has caused and may in the future cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products increases in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to actual product failure rates field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting product failures have caused and could in the future cause us to materially increase the amount of warranty obligations and have had and may have in the future a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations 

we also depend significantly on our reputation for reliability and highquality products and services exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business if our products and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired and we may lose or be unable to gain or retain customers

defects and poor performance in our products could result in loss of customers decreased revenue and unexpected expenses and increases in warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

our products must meet stringent quality requirements and may contain undetected errors or defects especially when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product these errors or defects may be dangerous as defective power components may cause power overloads potentially resulting in explosion or fire as we develop new generations of our products and enter new markets we face higher risk of undetected defects because our testing protocols may not be able to fully test the products under all possible operating conditions in the past we have experienced defects in our products due to errors in the manufacturing and design process any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts in order to address or remedy any defects   and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

furthermore defective inefficient or poorly performing power components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim also we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain this coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty and product liability claims or product recalls may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our installers and enduser customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems may contain undetected errors failures or bugs especially when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our monitoring service could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses 

if we are unable to effectively manage our operations our business and operating results may suffer 

we have experienced and expect to experience in the future volatility in our sales and operations our historical growth and our more recent cost reduction initiatives have placed and are expected to continue to place significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources to 

 we cannot assure you that our current and planned operations personnel systems internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations if we cannot manage our sales and operations effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects

our recent and planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we currently offer solar pv systems targeting the residential and commercial markets throughout the world and we intend to expand into other international markets our success in new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 

 further new geographic markets and larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

 failure to address these new markets successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these markets to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

–   25  – 

ordering patterns from our distributors may cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period 

our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their assessment of endcustomer demand and their forecasts because these forecasts may not be accurate channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly due to the difference between their forecasts and actual demand as a result distributors may adjust their purchase orders placed with us in response to changing channel inventory levels as well as their assessment of the latest market demand trends we have limited visibility into future end customer demand a significant decrease in our distributors’ channel inventory in one period may lead to a significant rebuilding of channel inventory in subsequent periods or vice versa which may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly this fluctuation may cause our results to fall short of analyst or investor expectations in a certain period which may cause our stock price to decline 

if potential owners of solar pv systems based on our product platform are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms we could experience a reduction in the demand for our solar pv systems 

many owners of solar pv systems depend on financing to purchase their systems the limited use of microinverters to date coupled with our relatively smaller size and capitalization compared to some of our competitors could result in lenders refusing to provide the financing necessary to purchase solar pv systems based on our product platform on favorable terms or at all moreover in the case of debt financed projects even if lenders are willing to finance the purchase of these systems an increase in interest rates or a change in tax incentives could make it difficult for owners to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all in addition we believe that a significant percentage of owners purchase solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of upfront cash and financing difficulties in obtaining financing for solar pv systems on favorable terms or increases in interest rates or changes in tax incentives could lower an investor’s return on investment in a solar pv system or make alternative solar pv systems or other investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems based on our product platform any of these events could result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant share of residential solar installations has been provided through thirdparty financing structures such as power purchase or lease agreements our sales growth may depend on sales to developers of thirdparty solar finance offerings who provide solar as a service via power purchase agreements or leasing structures the thirdparty finance market for residential solar in the us and elsewhere is or may become highly concentrated with a few significant finance companies and several smaller entrants if we are unable develop relationships and gain a significant share of inverter sales to the major finance companies or new entrants our overall sales growth could be constrained 

we rely primarily on distributors installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue 

we sell our solutions primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and sales to developers of thirdparty solar finance offerings we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties and as a result many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results

we may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing 

we are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets we have made investments in our infrastructure increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so any new product is subject to certain risks including component sourcing strategic partner selection and execution customer acceptance competition product differentiation market timing challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow if we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new product introductions these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline projected thus having a materially adverse impact on our revenue operating results and financial stability 

our success in “ac module” versions of our microinverter system will depend in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers 

we continue to work on variants of our microinverter systems that enable direct attachment of a microinverter to solar modules the market success of such “ac module” solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with sunpower and other solar module manufacturers to design microinverters that are compatible with such direct attachment to solar modules we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial challenges faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules and the tariffs in the us 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the us and in other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the us we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade secrets copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof   or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business 

–   27  – 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against our competitors we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources   and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe upon any intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the us and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent applications an adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

 any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

we have licensed and in the future we may choose or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development and marketing of our products we cannot assure that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software   since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis   or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code any of the above could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

–   28  – 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles 

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations particularly in climates that experience colder or rainier weather during the winter months such as northern europe canada and the us in general we expect our products in the second third and fourth quarters will be positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles preceded by a seasonally softer first quarter in the us customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder and wetter months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock 

in august 2018 we issued and sold a total of 65 million convertible senior notes due 2023 the “convertible notes” in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and an affiliate of the company the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions in addition the anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt including the convertible notes and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our indebtedness including the convertible notes will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of those activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations including our obligations under the convertible notes 

we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the convertible notes upon a fund amental change or to repay the convertible notes at maturity 

holders of our convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at 100 of the principal amount of the convertible notes plus accrued and unpaid interest fundamental change is defined in the indenture entered into in connection with the convertible note financing and consists of events such as an acquisition of a majority of our outstanding common stock an acquisition of our company or substantially all of our assets the approval by our stockholders of a plan of liquidation or dissolution or our common stock no longer being listed on the nasdaq global select market the nasdaq global market or the new york stock exchange moreover we will be required to repay the convertible notes in cash at their maturity in august 2023 unless earlier converted or repurchased however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of convertible notes surrendered or repay the convertible notes at maturity 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital or debt financing to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 



–   29  – 

 we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events and opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act has required and will continue to require significant attention of management we are required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act in conjunction with this annual report on form 10k if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our ability to use net operating losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the internal revenue code and may be subject to further limitation as a result of future transactions 

sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a more than 50 percentage point increase in the percentage of its stock owned by certain stockholders over a threeyear period to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in the years after the ownership change these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders who directly or indirectly own 5 or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company generally if an ownership change occurs the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm taxexempt rate and the value of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change if these limitations apply we may be unable to offset our taxable income with net operating losses or our tax liability with credits before these losses and credits expire we have performed a study under section 382 of the code for fiscal year 2018 to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation under section 382 of the code based on the study we  do not anticipate these limitations will significantly impact our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards however it is possible that future transactions including issuances of new shares of our common stock and sales of shares of our common stock or other equitylinked securities will cause us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes in that event we generally would not be able to use our net operating losses from periods prior to this ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by sections 382 and 383 of the code and those attributes that are already subject to limitations as a result of our prior ownership changes may be subject to more stringent limitations

comprehensive tax reform laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 or tax reform act that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities these changes include i a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 ii a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense iii a shift of the us taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the us income tax base and iv a onetime tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets with the latter taxed at a lower rate on december 22 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 118 “sab 118” which provides a measurement period of no more than a year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under accounting standards codification “asc” 740 “asc 740” “income taxes” if our current taxable loss position should change the tax reform act could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a costefficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america europe australia and other markets we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation   or are otherwise required to continue to substitute more expensive air transportation to meet delivery time requirements our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k  and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter this variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations these fluctuations are due to numerous factors including 



–   31  – 

 the above factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

techniques employed by manipulative short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock 

short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender short sellers hope to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale as it is in the short seller’s best interests for the price of the stock to decline some short sellers publish or arrange for the publication of negative opinions regarding the issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short the use of the internet social media and blogging have allowed short sellers to publicly attack a company’s credibility strategy and veracity by means of socalled “research reports” that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by legitimate securities research analysts these short attacks have in the past led to stock price declines and significant selling activity in our common stock issuers with limited trading volumes or substantial retail shareholder bases can be particularly susceptible to higher volatility levels and can be particularly vulnerable to such short attacks 

short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental selfregulatory organization or other official authority in the us are not subject to the certification requirements imposed by the sec in regulation ac regulation analyst certification and accordingly the opinions they express may be based on distortions of actual facts or in some cases outright fabrications in light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information and the significant profits that can be made from running successful short attacks short sellers will likely continue to issue such reports such shortseller attacks may cause our stock to suffer a decline in market price 

if we fail to meet the continued listing standards of nasdaq our common stock may be delisted which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and market price of our common stock 

our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global market the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet these requirements in the future if we fail to meet any such requirements nasdaq may initiate delisting processes if our common stock were to be delisted the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors collectively own a significant percentage of our common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of o ur common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to agreed limits on sale volumes and the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act for instance in december we filed a resale registration statement related to 75 million  shares of our common stock that were issued to sunpower upon the closing of the apa transaction any sales of securities by sunpower or other stockholders with registration rights could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition our term loan agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends consequently an investor’s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future however shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we contract with third parties including one of our contract manufacturers to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the us europe and asia

net revenues 





 2018 compared to 2017 net revenues increased  by 10  in 2018  as compared to 2017  due primarily to an increase in the average selling price per inverter combined with 53 million  of revenue earned under a joint development agreement we sold 28 million  microinverter units in 2018  as compared to 29 million  units in the same period in 2017  the impact of the lower sales volume was more than offset by an increase in average selling price per microinverter due to the transition to our iq series of microinverters and pricing management see note 3  “ revenue recognition ” of the notes to   consolidated financial statements 

2017 compared to 2016 net revenues decreased by 11 to 2862 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 the number of microinverter units sold decreased by 6 to approximately 29 million units in 2017 in part due to our efforts to improve gross margins which included foregoing lowmargin sales net revenues decreased yearoveryear primarily due to the lower volume combined with a decline in the average selling prices of our products the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by the recognition of 22 million of deferred revenue resulting from a change in estimate of the service period related to sales of our envoy product 

cost of revenues and gross margin 





 2018 compared to 2017 cost of revenues decreased  by 4  in 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily due to an 11   decrease  in the average product cost gross margin increased by 103 percentage points for 2018 as compared to 2017  the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to increased product margins as a result of the transition to our iq 7 microinverter as well as our other product cost management efforts the improvement in margin due to the 53 million  in revenue under a joint development arrangement was offset by an increase in other cost of goods sold including increased expedite fees and logistics costs associated with supply constraints due to industry wide component shortages our ability to reduce product costs and the timing of product cost reductions relative to declines in the selling prices of our products can have a significant impact on our gross margin 

2017 compared to 2016 cost of revenues decreased by 13 in 2017 as compared to 2016 and was primarily attributable to the transition in 2017 to our next generation iq microinverters which have a lower cost profile than the previous generation as well as the decline in sales volume gross margin increased by 16 percentage points to 196 in 2017 as compared to 180 in 2016 the primary drivers of the gross margin increase were lower warranty expense and logistics costs as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016

2017 compared to 2016 research and development expenses decreased by 175 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative that eliminated noncore projects resulting in an 115 million reduction in research and development personnel related expenses and a 59 million reduction in lab parts product prototypes and professional fees 

sales and marketing 



2018 compared to 2017 sales and marketing expense increased  by 39 million  in 2018  as compared to 2017  the increase  was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses professional fees equipment costs advertising and marketing expenses and bad debt expenses the increase was partially offset by lower facilities costs the increase  in personnelrelated expenses include higher stockbased compensation expense payroll expenses due to increasing our sales team and recruiting fees the increase  in personnelrelated expenses was partially offset by lower spending on contractors and temporary employees bonus compensation and benefits

the income tax provision of 14 million  in 2018 compared to the income tax benefit of 01 million  in 2017 was primarily due to increased foreign taxes and decreased benefit from tax reform

convertible debt  in august 2018  we sold 650 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2023 the “convertible notes” the notes are senior unsecured and bear interest at a rate of 40  per year payable semiannually on february 1  and august 1  of each year beginning on february 1 2019  the convertible notes will mature on august 1 2023  unless earlier repurchased by us or converted at the option of the holders we may not redeem the convertible notes prior to the maturity date and no sinking fund is provided for the notes as of december 31 2018  650 million  aggregate principal amount of the notes was outstanding see note 11  “ debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k  

in february 2018 we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor pursuant to which we in a private placement issued and sold to the investor 9523809 shares of our common stock at a price per share of 210 resulting in gross proceeds of 200 million 

term loans in july 2016 we entered into a loan and security agreement with lenders that are affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners llc which was subsequently amended and modified in 2017 and 2018 “term loans” as of december 31 2018 we have 415 million  outstanding on our term loans as of december 31 2018 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the term loan agreement on january 28 2019  we repaid in full the remaining principal amount of the term loans of   395 million  plus accrued interest and fees  see note 11  “ debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k  for further discussion on the term loans 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months 

cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented in thousands 



c ash flows from operating activities 

for 2018 net cash provided by operating activities of 161 million  was primarily due to adjustments for noncash items more than offsetting the net loss of 116 million  the net cash provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2018 was a 231 million  increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities a 97 million  decrease in inventory and a 15 million  increase in warranty obligations offsetting the cash provided was a 135 million  increase in accounts receivable a 100 million  increase in intangible assets related to our acquisition of sunpower’s microinverter business a 61 million  decrease in deferred revenues and a 31 million  increase in contract assets 

for 2017 net cash used in operating activities was 284 million primarily resulted from a net loss of 452 million the net loss was partially offset by noncash charges including stockbased compensation of 67 million depreciation and amortization of 90 million asset impairment and noncash restructuring charges of 11 million and a provision for doubtful accounts of 05 million changes in net operating assets and liabilities used cash of 14 million 

the primary uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities in 2017 were a 65 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities a 48 million increase in accounts receivable and a 16 million decrease in warranty obligations offsetting these uses of cash was a decrease in inventory of 60 million and an increase in deferred revenue of 53 million 

for 2016 net cash used in operating activities was 330 million primarily resulted from a net loss of 675 million the net loss was partially offset by noncash charges including stockbased compensation of 103 million depreciation and amortization of 106 million asset impairment and restructuring charges of 32 million and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of 31 million in addition the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities provided cash of 72 million 

–   46  – 

the primary sources of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities in 2016 were an 113 million increase in deferred revenue related to our enlighten service and deferred product revenue an 88 million decrease in inventory and an 89 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities offsetting these sources of cash was an increase in accounts receivable of 180 million and an increase in other assets of 48 million the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and the increase in other assets was primarily attributable to an increase in customer financing receivables 

cash flows from investing activities 

for 2018 net cash used in investing activities of 192 million  primarily resulted from a 150 million  payment related to the acquisition of sunpower’s microinverter business and 42 million  for purchases of test and assembly equipment and capitalized costs related to internaluse software

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  





 as of 2018  the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties was approximately 13 million  since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 15  “ income taxes ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k  an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our solutions which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway the cloudbased enlighten monitoring service and ac battery storage solutions to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners 

–   48  – 

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards codification “asc” no 606 “revenue recognition” “asc 606” or “topic 606” and applied the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of january 1 2018 the most significant impacts upon adoption of topic 606 were how we account for revenue related to our envoy communications device and related enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives are recognized the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred and recognized over the estimated service period 

revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services we generate all of our revenues from contracts with our customers a description of principal activities from which we generate revenues are as follows 

 we previously sold envoy communications device to certain customers under a longterm financing arrangement under this financing arrangement we net the unbilled receivables against deferred revenue 

we record certain contra revenue promotions as variable consideration and recognizes these promotions at the time the related revenue is recorded 

we record upfront contract acquisition costs such as sales commissions to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset for contracts that have a duration of less than one year we follow the topic 606 practical expedient and expense these costs when incurred commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service are capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue 

see note 3  “ revenue recognition ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k  for additional information related to revenue recognition 

inventory 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market market is current replacement cost by purchase or by reproduction dependent on the type of inventory in cases where market exceeds net realizable value  ie  estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal inventories are stated at net realizable value market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin we determine cost on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory including customer demand and market conditions management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2018 2017 and 2016 were not material

warranty obligations 

microinverters sold through december 31 2013 

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product’s warranty term  15 years  for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years  for third and fourth generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time  ie  failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time  ie  claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time  ie  replacement cost 

estimated failure rates — our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mean time between failure “mtfb” estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into operating environments we continue to monitor product performance through our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three  to nine months  between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three  to nine months  when a microinverter fails and is returned we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure through enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 

estimated claim rates — warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 

estimated replacement costs — three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time between 15  and 25 years  depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

in addition to the key estimates noted above we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates may be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material

fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1 2014 

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provide us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty under asc 825 “financial instruments” also referred to as the “fair value option” an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years  

we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result the expected present value technique an income approach converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our creditadjusted riskfree rate see note 9  “ fair value measurements ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k  for additional information 

business combinations 

assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities   assumed is recorded as goodwill determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles and liabilities acquired also requires us to make estimates which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset accounting for business acquisitions requires us to make judgments as to whether a purchase transaction is a multiple element contract meaning that it includes other transaction components this judgment and determination affect the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to assets and liabilities acquired in the business purchase transaction

 item 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

foreign currency exchange risk 

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure primarily from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros indian rupee and australian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european indian australian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

we have utilized foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to anticipated cash receipts from expected future revenues denominated in euros and intercompany transaction gains or losses the contracts we enter into typically have maturities of less than one year we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes any foreign currency forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations we were not party to any foreign currency contracts as of december 31 2017  and we did not enter into any foreign currency forward contracts during 2018  

–   51  – 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had no  outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of less than one year in each year ended december 31 2018  and 2017  we recorded no  net gains related to foreign currency forward contracts in year ended december 31 2016  we recorded 01 million  net gains related to foreign currency forward contracts

 item 1 business 

our company 

we deliver simple innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy  our semiconductorbased microinverter system converts direct current dc electricity to alternating current ac electricity at the individual solar module level and brings a systembased high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors networking and cloudbased software technologies our technology was designed to increase energy production simplify design and installation improve system uptime and reliability reduce fire risk and provide a platform for intelligent energy management since inception we have shipped more than 16 million microinverters representing over 3 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic pv generating capacity and more than 739000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 110 countries   

we were incorporated as pvi solutions inc in march 2006 in the state of delaware and changed our name to enphase energy inc in july 2007 

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic or pv installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter as compared to microinverter systems we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar systems including the following 



specialized equipment such as dc combiners conduits and disconnects in addition the use of highvoltage dc requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology 

 these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

 our products 

we design develop manufacture and sell home energy solutions that connect energy generation energy storage and control and communications management on one intelligent platform we have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductorbased microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies provides advanced energy monitoring and control this is vastly different than the string inverter approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array in 2017 we expanded our product offerings by launching the enphase home energy solution with iq™ our nextgeneration integrated solar storage and energy management offering the iq platform enables selfconsumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy simplifying design and installation and improving system uptime and reliability the iq family of microinverters like all previous enphase microinverters is fully compliant with nec 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements unlike string inverters this capability is builtin with no additional equipment necessary 

the enphase home energy solution with iq brings a high technology networked approach to solar generation plus energy storage by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors and cloudbased software technologies our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home’s energy potential while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities the enphase home energy solution with iq uses a single technology platform for seamless management of the whole solution enabling rapid commissioning of the installer toolkit consumption monitoring with a metered envoy and a consumption tracker and energy insights from the the enphase enlighten software™ platform’s easytouse interface unlike our core competitors who utilize a singlepoint or traditional inverter or offer separate components of solutions we have builtin system redundancy in both pv generation and energy storage eliminating the risk that comes with a singlepoint of failure further the nature of our cloudbased monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates enabling costeffective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance 

the enphase home energy solution with iq consists of four key components  enphase microinverters the ac battery an envoy gateway and enlighten cloudbased software 

 iq 6 and iq 6 microinverters deliver more power and efficiency while further reducing the balance of system cost due to their simplified wiring reduced size and weight they integrate with ac modules and offer installers faster and simpler installations saving on soft costs    iq 6 microinverters support highpowered 60 and 72cell solar modules up to 330 w dc and the iq 6 pairs with modules up to 400 w dc    the iq 7 introduced in the first quarter of 2018 is segmented into 3 variants  the 250w ac iq 7 for 60cell modules the 295w ac iq 7 for both 60cell and 72cell modules and the 320w ac iq 7x for 96cell modules iq 6 was not compatible with 96cell modules iq 7x fills that gap and will offer even more power and a smaller lighter and easiertoinstall product iq 7 is a single worldwide sku achieved as a result of our softwaredefined architecture 

while we believe our iq 7 products provide us with a good platform for growth worldwide starting in 2018 our iq 8 system which is expected to be introduced in 2019 is based on our gridagnostic “always on” ensemble™ technology which will allow a solar system to operate independently of the power grid 

one of solar’s biggest challenges is that it is tied to the power grid if the grid fails and the sun is still shining there will be no production out of a user’s solar system to address this limitation we have invented a microinverter technology that is completely independent of the power grid the enphase system’s capability is further enhanced when the ensemble technology is incorporated into our ac battery storage solution with iq 8 a user can have a system that will continuously provide energy regardless of the presence or absence of the grid utilizing solar power during the day and storage at night we refer to this as “always on” 

the iq 8 asic as of the end of 2017 is fully functional demonstrating the feasibility of ensemble technology this asic has 5 million gates and is made in 55nm technology at tsmc enabling very high speed digital signal processing we are continuing to productize iq 8 and expect to introduce it in 2019 



solar pv system two versions of the monitoring software are available myenlighten designed for consumers   which provides performance assurance and enlighten manager   available for the solar professional which provides detailed diagnostic capabilities as well as fleet management tools 

  

key benefits of our home energy solution with iq include 

  

truly integrated  the enphase home energy solution with iq is a fully integrated solar generation plus storage offering from one provider designed and manufactured to work together the home energy solution with iq is a truly integrated home energy solution 

higher performance our microinverter system delivers higher performance by maximizing the energy production of each module a microinverter at each module overcomes issues such as module mismatch and soiling or shading which can have a significant impact on string inverter systems enphase microinverters also provide greater system availability with no singlepoint of failure an independent analysis from pv evolution labs has concluded an enphase microinverter system yields higher performance over systems with string inverters or traditional inverters we believe that our microinverter systems achieve higher energy production and can generate superior returns on investment relative to competitive solutions for system owners   

  

simplified design and installation our allac infrastructure simplifies the design process and eliminates the typical costs of a complicated dc voltage system for pv or storage   in addition our microinverters are installed on the roof and hidden from view   with minimal impact to the aesthetics of a home or building we also offer additional tools such as the enphase installer toolkit mobile app or the enphase iq combiner™ with enphase iq envoy™ which offer unmatched simplicity reliability and ease of installation for solar installers   

  

enhanced safety    microinverters and ac batteries are safer because they process low voltage dc and are isolated to the module level leading to an allac architecture our microinverter system does not contain any of the high voltages common to string inverter systems high voltage arc faults associated with string or traditional inverters are the leading cause of fires of solar pv installations microinverter technology mitigates this safety risk   

reduced operations and maintenance costs our microinverter system is highly reliable with one million poweron hours of testing incorporated into our microinverter design this high reliability   plus a distributed architecture means ongoing operations and maintenance do not require emergency truck rolls unlike string inverter or traditional inverters which have a 100 probability of failure leading to full replacement within 10 to 12 years in addition with modulelevel monitoring capabilities remote maintenance can pinpoint issues thus reducing any time on site finally   the networkednature of our system enables us to remotely update the firmware and software of the microinverters reducing ongoing utility compliance costs

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and optimize the effectiveness of our energy management solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development against metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and easeofuse 

our research and development expenses were 332 million  507 million  and 508 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2017 we had 105 issued us patents 47 issued foreign patents 65 pending us patent applications and 27 pending foreign counterpart patent applications our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2027 and 2033    

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our asics pursuant to a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any third party manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in 

the solar energy market the license carries a seventyfive year term subject to earlier termination upon mutual agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices or cplds and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

with respect to among other things proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

  

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us   

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our microinverter technology or business plans 

seasonality 

historically sales of our products in the second third and to a lesser extent fourth quarters have been positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles followed by a seasonally softer first quarter  although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers and new technology startups the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 



 competitors in the inverter market are amongst others sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh abb ltd and solaredge technologies inc and other emerging companies offering alternative microinverter dc to dc optimizer and other power electronic solutions  we principally compete with the large incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to our microinverter solution we believe however that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central or string inverter technology even when traditional central or string inverter technology is supplemented by dctodc optimizers competitors in the storage market are currently emerging and may include producers of battery cells and other integrated storage systems 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2017  we had 336 fulltime employees of the fulltime employees 146 were engaged in research and development 115 in sales and marketing 36 in a general and administrative capacity and 39 in manufacturing and operations of these employees 251 were in the united states 19 in europe 33 in new zealand 15 in australia 16 in india and two employees in canada 

  

none of our us new zealand uk and australia employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a   risk factors 

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

we have a history of losses which may continue in the future and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability 

in connection with the issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  we concluded that there was substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern we have taken and continue to take steps to improve our financial position including raising additional capital and we have concluded as of december 31 2017 that substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists however we have incurred substantial net losses since our inception and we may continue to incur additional losses in the future for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we incurred net losses of 452 million  675 million  and 221 million  respectively at december 31 2017  we had an accumulated deficit of 2957 million  our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our offerings increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share the impact of the january 2018 trade tariffs established by president trump or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents available credit facilities and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 

 we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events including unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which 

are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer 

our microinverter and ac battery storage systems are utilized in solar photovoltaic or pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years   and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 

 if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow demand for our customers products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology have recently caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of lowercost manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2017 two customers accounted for approximately 15 and 11 of total net revenues our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements generally do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period in addition these customers may decide to no longer use or to reduce the use of our products and services for other reasons that may be out of our control the loss of or events affecting one or more of our large customers have had could have and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

we are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our gross margins 

the solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time we have reduced the prices of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future including from our major customers in addition we have reduced our prices ahead of planned cost reductions of our products which has adversely affected our gross margins when seeking to maintain or increase their market share our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products in addition our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our gross margins would continue to be adversely affected 

given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological change a principal component of our business strategy is reducing the costs to manufacture our products to remain competitive if our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the efficiency of their products our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency and we may be forced to sell our products at a price lower than our cost further if raw materials costs and other thirdparty component costs were to increase we may not meet our cost reduction targets if we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap we may not be able to remain price competitive which would result in lost market share and lower gross margins 

the inverter industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce products which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share 

the market for pv inverter solutions is highly competitive to date we have competed primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers but as the solar industry rapidly grows new solutions and technologies are emerging that will directly compete with our business we believe that a number of companies have 

developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our microinverter systems in the modulelevel power electronics market competitors in the inverter market include amongst others solaredge technologies inc sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh and abb ltd other existing or emerging companies such as huawei technologies co ltd may also begin offering alternative microinverter dc to dc optimizer and other power electronic solutions 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial marketing distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition especially in certain markets in addition some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and creating market awareness for these offerings further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices of our products in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipate or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

we also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally for instance sunpower corporation has its own microinverter technology which it incorporates into its ac module products other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform dc to ac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these inverter products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our microinverter systems or sell products that compete with our microinverter systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

our pv systems including our ac battery storage solution integrated ac module and recently announced seventhgeneration iq microinverters may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share 

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products including international acceptance of our seventhgeneration iq microinverters there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 



 in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central or string inverters or who currently sell dctodc optimizers these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central or string inverter systems or dc optimizers which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our microinverter systems 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries including the united states have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs or fits rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions that we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place additionally electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

us government actions with regard to the solar energy sector or international trade could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the current us presidential administration may continue to create regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector generally and the solar energy sector in particular if the administration or the us congress take action to eliminate or reduce legislation regulations and incentives supporting solar energy such actions may result in a decrease in demand for solar energy in the united states and other geographical markets which could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

on january 23 2018 president donald trump signed a proclamation establishing tariffs on certain solar equipment manufactured outside of the us such tariffs could have a negative impact on the overall demand for solar products in the us it remains unclear how such tariffs may apply to ac module products incorporating our microinverters if the tariffs are applied specifically to products that we or our commercial partners import such remedies could hurt the demand for these products and materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore a significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries including mexico canada and china during the 2016 election campaign thencandidate trump made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements including the north american free trade agreement “nafta” at this time it remains unclear what the administration or the us congress may or may not do with respect to these international trade agreements if the administration takes action to impose any border tariff or to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or certain other international trade agreements our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory difficulties in planning expenses or disputes with suppliers any of which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material we may also become involved in disputes with our suppliers who may claim that we failed to fulfill forecast or minimum purchase requirements conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and cost efficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

we are currently involved in a dispute with one of our suppliers regarding whether we were obligated to purchase a minimum amount of product under a supply agreement our efforts to reach a business resolution to the matter have not been successful to date we believe believe that the supplier’s claims are without merit and that we have a legally defensible position in this matter we intend to vigorously defend against any claims that may be brought by our supplier however if a legal action is brought and that matter is determined adversely to us we may be required to pay damages in an amount that would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications 

to date we have generated the majority of our revenues from north america and expect to continue to generate a substantial amount of our revenues from north america in the future there are a number of important incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products a substantial majority of our revenues come from the united states which has both federal and state incentives for instance the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 currently provides a 30 federal 

tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 and reduced tax credits of 26 and 22 through december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning in 2022 these tax credits could be reduced or eliminated as part of tax code changes or regulatory reform initiatives by the current congress and presidential administration 

in addition net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and in some instances modified which may have a negative impact on future inverter sales we derive a significant portion of our revenues from california’s residential solar market and the existing california net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of residential solar systems california however is reevaluating existing incentives tariffs and rates for residential systems in order to accommodate a sustainable growth trajectory for residential solar and to also encourage the adoption of other distributed energy resources such as energy storage that provide additional benefits to the consumer and the electricity grid there is a risk that future regulatory changes will not adequately stimulate future growth in the residential solar market 

we also sell our products in europe a number of european countries including germany belgium italy and the united kingdom have adopted reductions or concluded their fit programs certain countries have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe 

we also sell our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a renewable energy target ret that is intended to ensure that 33000 gigawatthours of australias electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020 in 2016 australia reelected its conservative national government which revised national energy policy in october of 2017 with the introduction of the national energy guarantee the national energy guarantee imposes a reliability obligation and an emissions reduction expectation on energy retailers and a small number of large electricity users energy retailers will have to have a mix in their portfolio generation from dispatchable sources and from lowemissions sources to meet their regulatory obligations the direct action plan previously put into place remains and has been renamed the emissions reduction fund this plan primarily provides funding to corporations to reduce emissions the emissions reduction fund is the central component in the australian governments policy suite to reduce emissions and operates alongside existing programs such as the renewable energy target the national carbon offset standard and energy efficiency standards on appliances equipment and buildings the objective of the emissions reduction fund is to help achieve australia’s 2020 emissions reduction target of 5 below 2000 levels by 2020 and 2628 below 2005 emissions by 2030 the australian government has provided 255 billion of funding toward the emissions reduction fund with further funding to be considered in future budgets states and territories in australia have different fits and the gradual reduction of fits in some states may reduce the incentive for homeowners to export unused solar energy produced back to the grid 

we also sell our products in ontario canada the government of ontario has the authority to modify suspend or discontinue the fit program at any time and has currently suspended it suspension of the fit program in ontario directly impacted and could continue to impact our business furthermore any future suspension or modification of the program could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe the federal and state tax credits applicable federal and state grants applicable tariffs and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception however unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential solar market the phaseout of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future the reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy including local content requirements have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business domestically and abroad additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example several states or territories including california hawaii and queensland australia have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar systems that we may not be able to currently comply with in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks for our business 

the threat of global economic capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks for our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have in the past reduced demand for solar products for instance the european sovereign debt crisis in recent years has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales internationally 

natural disasters terrorist or cyber attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in petaluma california is located near major earthquake fault lines and near the sites of recent catastrophic wild fires further a terrorist attack including one aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our cloudbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products in the event that an earthquake fire tsunami typhoon terrorist or cyber attack or other natural manmade or technical catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain 

unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information was to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business in addition our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems is dependent on cloudbased hosting services along with the availability of internet services at enduser premises a disruption infiltration or failure of our information technology systems thirdparty cloud hosting platforms or enduser internet services as a result of software or hardware malfunctions system implementations or upgrades computer viruses cyberattacks thirdparty security breaches employee error theft or misuse malfeasance power disruptions natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security failure of our enlighten service loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner customer and employee personal data we have been and may in the future be subject to fraud attempts from outside parties through our electronic systems such as “phishing” email communications to our finance technical or other personnel which could put us at risk for harm from fraud theft or other loss if our internal controls do not operate as intended any of these events could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and lowering sales of our products in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar components industry including manufacturers of central inverters and dc to dc optimizers could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to make installation or operation of solar distributed generation more costly such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by 

solar pv installations incorporating our microinverter systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to continue to incur additional warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue and gross profit to decline 

we have offered 15year limited warranties for our first and second generation microinverters and offer a limited warranty of up to 25 years on each subsequent generation microinverters our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our microinverters under normal use and service conditions for up to 25 years following installation as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized revenue our estimated costs of warranty for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty 

while we offer warranties of up to 25 years our microinverters have only been in use since mid2008 when we first commenced commercial sales of our products although we conduct accelerated life cycle testing to measure performance and reliability our microinverter systems have not been tested over the full warranty cycle and do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life in addition under realworld operating conditions which may vary by location and design as well as insolation soiling and weather conditions a typical solar pv installation may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions if our products perform below expectations or have unexpected reliability problems we may be unable to gain or retain customers and could face substantial warranty expense 

we are required to make assumptions and apply judgments based on our accelerated life cycle testing and the limited operating history of our products regarding a number of factors including the durability and reliability of our products our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the costs of replacement of defective products our assumptions have proved and could in the future prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our products which has caused and may in the future cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products increases in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to actual product failure rates field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting product failures have caused and could in the future cause us to materially increase the amount of warranty obligations and have had and may have in the future a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations 

we also depend significantly on our reputation for reliability and highquality products and services exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business if our products and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired and we may lose or be unable to gain or retain customers 

defects and poor performance in our products could result in loss of customers decreased revenue and unexpected expenses and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

our products must meet stringent quality requirements and may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product these errors or defects may be dangerous as defective power components may cause power overloads potentially resulting in explosion or fire as we develop new generations of our products and enter new markets we face higher risk of undetected defects because our testing protocols may not be able to fully test the products under all possible operating conditions in the past we have experienced defects in our products due to certain errors in the manufacturing and design process any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts in order to address or remedy any defects and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

furthermore defective inefficient or poorly performing power components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected 

products we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim also we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain this coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty and product liability claims or product recalls may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems based on our product platform may contain undetected errors failures or bugs especially when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our monitoring service could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses 

if we are unable to effectively manage our workforce our business and operating results may suffer 

we have experienced and expect to experience in the future volatility in our sales and operations our historical growth and our more recent cost reduction initiatives have placed and are expected to continue to place significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources to 

 we cannot assure you that our current and planned operations personnel systems internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations if we cannot manage our sales and operations effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects 

our recent and planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we currently offer pv systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets we intend to expand into other international markets including india the remainder of europe and south america our success in these new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 



further new geographic markets and the larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

 failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these products to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

ordering patterns from our distributors may cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period 

our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their assessment of endcustomer demand and their forecasts because these forecasts may not be accurate channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly due to the difference between their forecasts and actual demand as a result distributors adjust their purchase orders placed with us in response to changing channel inventory levels as well as their assessment of the latest market demand trends we have limited visibility into future end customer demand a significant decrease in our distributors’ channel inventory in one period may lead to a significant rebuilding of channel inventory in subsequent periods or vice versa which may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly this fluctuation may cause our results to fall short of analyst or investor expectations in a certain period which may cause our stock price to decline 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products in particular we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of microinverter products cabling and our communications gateway related to our microinverter systems our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our other manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which the vast majority of our microinverters related cabling and communications gateway products are manufactured are located outside of the united states we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the united states increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our relationships with our distributors and end customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in our manufacturing partner’s fabrication facility due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages and changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of production lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension of manufacturing production lines could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 

we depend on solesource and limitedsource suppliers for key components of our products for example our asics are purchased from a sole source supplier or developed for us by sole source suppliers any of the solesource and limitedsource suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues could stop producing our components cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms including price or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially 

require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of solesource or limitedsource components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business 

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if potential owners of solar pv systems based on our product platform are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms we could experience a reduction in the demand for our solar pv systems 

many owners of solar pv systems depend on financing to purchase their systems the limited use of microinverters to date coupled with our relatively smaller size and capitalization compared to some of our competitors could result in lenders refusing to provide the financing necessary to purchase solar pv systems based on our product platform on favorable terms or at all moreover in the case of debt financed projects even if lenders are willing to finance the purchase of these systems an increase in interest rates or a change in tax incentives could make it difficult for owners to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all in addition we believe that a significant percentage of owners purchase solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of upfront cash and financing difficulties in obtaining financing for solar pv systems on favorable terms or increases in interest rates or changes in tax incentives could lower an investor’s return on investment in a solar pv system or make alternative solar pv systems or other investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems based on our product platform any of these events could result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant share of residential solar installations has been provided through thirdparty financing structures such as power purchase or lease agreements our sales growth may depend on sales to developers of thirdparty solar finance offerings who provide solar as a service via power purchase agreements or leasing structures the thirdparty finance market for residential solar in the united states and elsewhere is or may become highly concentrated with a few significant finance companies and several smaller entrants if we are unable develop relationships and gain a significant share of inverter sales to the major finance companies or new entrants our overall sales growth could be constrained 

we rely primarily on distributors large installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties and as a result many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their 

marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by these customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

we may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing 

we are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets we have made investments in our infrastructure increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so any new product is subject to certain risks including component sourcing strategic partner selection and execution customer acceptance competition product differentiation market timing challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow if we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new product introductions these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline projected thus having a materially adverse impact on our revenue operating results and financial stability in addition we are pursuing new geographic markets the inability to capture new customers in the highgrowth geographic markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success in an “ac module” version of our microinverter system may depend in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers 

we are currently working on variants of our microinverter system that will enable an “ac module” for direct attachment of the microinverter to the solar modules the market success of such solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with solar module manufacturers to design solar modules that are compatible with such direct attachment of our microinverter we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions combining our microinverter system and solar modules for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial challenges faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules and the new tariffs in the us 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled technical people is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business if we fail to retain our senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business could suffer 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the 

united states and in certain other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the united states we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade secrets in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against certain of our competitors from time to time we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the united states and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent applications an adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

 any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

from time to time we have licensed and in the future we may choose to or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products we cannot assure that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with applicable open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code any of the foregoing could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles 

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations particularly in climates that experience colder or rainier weather during the winter months such as northern europe canada and the united states in general we expect our products in the second third and fourth quarters will be positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles preceded by a seasonally softer first quarter in the united states customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder and wetter months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future 

covenants in our credit facility and term loan may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

we are a party to a term loan agreement with affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners llc this agreement restricts our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt encumbering our tangible or intangible property paying dividends or engaging in certain transactions such as mergers and acquisitions investments and asset sales these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under these agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness and the forfeiture of our assets subject to security interests in favor of the lenders 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and 

complying with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act has required and will continue to require significant attention of management although we are currently not required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting otherwise required by section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act this exemption will no longer be available to us beginning with our annual report on form 10k for 2018 if we are no longer deemed to be a “smaller reporting company” at such time if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in the future the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our ability to use net operating losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the internal revenue code and may be subject to further limitation as a result of future transactions 

sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a more than 50 percentage point increase in the percentage of its stock owned by certain stockholders over a threeyear period to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in the years after the ownership change these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders who directly or indirectly own 5 or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company generally if an ownership change occurs the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change if these limitations apply we may be unable to offset our taxable income with net operating losses or our tax liability with credits before these losses and credits expire we are in the process of updating our study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation under the code we do not anticipate these limitations will significantly impact our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 

in addition it is possible that future transactions including issuances of new shares of our common stock and sales of shares of our common stock will cause us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes in that event we generally would not be able to use our net operating losses from periods prior to this ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by sections 382 and 383 and those attributes that are already subject to limitations as a result of our prior ownership changes may be subject to more stringent limitations 

comprehensive tax reform laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the us government recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 or tax reform act that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities these changes include among others i a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 ii a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense iii a shift of the us taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the us income tax base and iv a onetime tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets with the latter taxed at a lower rate on december 22 2017 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which provides a measurement period of no more than a year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under accounting standards codification 740 asc 740 given our current taxable loss position based on our preliminary analysis we do not expect the new tax legislation to have a material cash tax impact on our business other than reducing the net operating loss carryforwards which is offset by a valuation allowance however due to the broad complexities of the tax reform act our asc 740 accounting for the tax reform is still subject to change which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america europe australia and other markets we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter this variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations these fluctuations are due to numerous factors including 



 the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

if we fail to meet the continued listing standards of nasdaq our common stock may be delisted which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and market price of our common stock 

our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global market the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet these requirements in the future if we fail to meet any such requirements nasdaq may initiate delisting processes if our common stock were to be delisted the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors collectively own a significant percentage of our common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock most of the outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as “may” “will” “should” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “predict” “intend” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology for example statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance expense levels and liquidity sources are forwardlooking statements our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

we deliver simple innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy  we were founded in march 2006 and are a market leader in the microinverter category of the us inverter market our technology was designed to increase energy production simplify design and installation improve system uptime and reliability reduce fire risk and provide a platform for intelligent energy management since inception we have shipped more than 16 million microinverters representing over 3 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic pv generating capacity and more than 739000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 110 countries 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers “oems” and strategic partners historically revenues generated from the us market have represented 7080 of our total revenue   

our first commercial shipment occurred in mid2008 our net revenues were  2862 million  3226 million  and 3572 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we incurred net losses of 452 million  675 million  and 221 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively as of december 31 2017 we had 291 million  in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of  387 million  

as of december 31 2017 we had 291 million in cash as compared to 178 million as of december 31 2016 in february 2018 we raised an additional 200 million through a private placement of common stock and also reached an agreement with our lender to defer approximately 50 of the principal payments due in 2018 under our term loans the amount deferred in 2018 will be amortized over the remaining term of the loan see notes 10 “debt” and 19 “subsequent events” to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

management has considered the above factors and has concluded that substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists at the time of filing of this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 

components of consolidated statements of operations 

net revenues 

we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems and related accessories which include microinverter units ac battery storage systems an envoy communications gateway and our enlighten cloudbased monitoring service 

our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems and related accessories supply and demand sales incentives and competitive product offerings our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers the diversification and expansion of our revenue base and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs warranty manufacturing personnel and logistics costs freight costs depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs our product costs are impacted by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation certain costs primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future however shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we contract with third parties including one of our contract manufacturers to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the united states europe and asia 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product cost product mix warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative and restructuring expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes recruiting costs sales commissions incentive compensation and stockbased compensation 

research and development expense includes personnelrelated expenses thirdparty design and development costs testing and evaluation costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors powerline communications networking and software functionality and storage we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs improve functionality and enhance reliability we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position 

sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnelrelated expenses such as salaries commissions stockbased compensation employee benefits and travel it also includes trade shows marketing customer support and other indirect costs we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors large installers oems and strategic partners we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand india and certain other asian markets  we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future 

  

general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries incentive compensation stockbased compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services which consist primarily of outside legal accounting and information technology consulting costs 

restructuring charges are the net of charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2016 and 2017 to improve operational performance and reduce overall operating expense and gain on divestiture of our services business costs included in restructuring primarily consist of severance for workforce reduction actions noncash charges related to the disposition of assets and impairment of property and equipment and the establishment of lease loss reserves see note 9 “restructuring and other charges” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other expense net 

other expense net primarily consists of interest expense and commitment fees under our revolving credit facility term loans and noncash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs other expense net also includes interest income and gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into us dollars 

provision for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products historically we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly due to the history of losses we have generated in the united states since inception we believe that it is morelikelythannot that all of our us and state deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31 2017  

summary consolidated statements of operations 

  

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented in thousands 

  



comparison of 2017  2016  and 2015   

  

net revenues 

  



  

2017  compared to 2016  net revenues decreased by 11   to 2862 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  the number of microinverter units sold decreased by 6 to approximately 29 million units in 2017 in part due to our 

efforts to improve gross margins which included foregoing lowmargin sales net revenues decreased yearoveryear primarily due to the lower volume combined with a decline in the average system selling price of approximately 5 in 2017  compared to 2016  the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by the recognition of 22 million of deferred revenue resulting from a change in estimate of the service period related to sales of our envoy product we expect the average selling price per watt of microinverters to continue to decline 

  

2016  compared to 2015  net revenues decreased by 10  to 3226 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  the number of microinverter units sold increased slightly in 2016 and was approximately 31 million units in both 2016 and 2015 net revenues decreased yearoveryear primarily due to a decline in the average system selling price of approximately 13 in 2016 compared to 2015 

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  



  

2017  compared to 2016  cost of revenues decreased by 13  in 2017  as compared to 2016  and was primarily attributable to the transition in 2017 to our next generation iq microinverters which have a lower cost profile than the previous generation as well as the decline in sales volume gross margin increased by 16 percentage points to 196  in 2017  as compared to 180  in 2016  the primary drivers of the gross margin increase were lower warranty expense and logistics costs as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016 see note 7 “warranty obligations” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the components of warranty expense 

  

2016  compared to 2015   cost of revenues increased by 6  in 2016  as compared to 2015  which was primarily attributable to a shift in product mix that resulted in increased sales of higherpriced accessories including our ac battery storage system gross margin decreased by 123 percentage points to 180  in 2016  as compared to 303  in 2015  while we experienced an overall reduction in our product costs our adoption of a more aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decrease to our gross margin in 2016  our gross margin also included the impact of higher warranty expense as compared to 2015  the higher warranty expense in 2016 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates which reduced gross margin by 12 percentage points see note 7 “warranty obligations” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

research and development 

  



  

2017  compared to 2016  research and development expenses decreased by 175 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative that eliminated noncore projects resulting in an 115 million reduction in research and development personnel related expenses and a 59 million reduction in lab parts product prototypes and professional fees the amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity we do not expect it to see the same magnitude of reduction in expense in the future as most of the benefits of our operating expense reduction initiatives were realized in 2017 

  

2016  compared to 2015   research and development expenses decreased by 01 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  the decrease was primarily due to decreased compensation costs and depreciation expense as a result of the restructuring actions taken in september 2016 the decrease was partially offset by higher outside professional fees utilized to support the development of new products as well as enhancements and cost reductions to existing products 

sales and marketing 

  



  

2017  compared to 2016  sales and marketing expenses decreased by 157 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  the decrease was primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative resulting in an 85 million decrease in compensation costs as a result of lower headcount and a 12 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives bad debt expense was reduced by 26 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and advertising and professional fees were reduced by 28 million we do not expect to see the same magnitude of cost savings in sales and marketing expenses in the future as we realized most of the benefits by the end of 2017 of the cost savings initiatives we implemented 

  

2016  compared to 2015   sales and marketing expenses decreased by 71 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 the decrease was primarily due to an 84 million decrease in compensation costs as a result of lower headcount and a 14 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives these decreases were partially offset by a 16 million increase in bad debt expense in 2016 and a 18 million benefit related to a revaluation of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration liability that was recorded in 2015 

  

general and administrative 

  



  

2017  compared to 2016  general and administrative expenses decreased by 52 million in 2017  as compared to 2016  the decrease is primarily due to the implementation of our restructuring initiative that eliminated noncore projects resulting in a 49 million reduction in general and administrative personnel related expenses a 08 million reduction in facilities related expenses and a 10 million reduction in depreciation expense as a result of a lower fixed asset base these decreases were partially offset by a 17 million increase in accounting and legal fees we do not expect to see the same magnitude of cost savings in general and administrative expenses in the future as we realized most of the benefits by the end of 2017 of the cost savings initiatives we implemented 

  

2016  compared to 2015   general and administrative expenses decreased by 34 million in 2016  as compared to 2015  the decrease was primarily the result of a 17 million reduction in compensation costs due to lower headcount a 02 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and a 18 million reduction in professional services which was primarily attributable to lower legal and other professional fees this decrease was partially offset by a 04 million increase in corporate expenses including rent utilities and depreciation 

restructuring and other charges 

  



  

2017  compared to 2016  we implemented a restructuring plan in 2016 to lower operating expenses and cost of revenues that included reductions in our global workforce and the elimination of certain noncore projects in 2017 we engaged a management consulting firm to assist us in making organizational and structural changes to improve operational efficiencies and reduce expenses restructuring charges in 2017 include 121 million of consulting services 28 million in cashbased severance and related benefits and 20 million in charges for asset impairments and lease loss reserves although we will continue to make business and process improvements our formal restructuring efforts were largely completed in 2017 and we do not expect to incur substantial additional restructuring charges in the near future 

  2016  compared to 2015  in 2016 restructuring and other charges included 13 million of severance and other costs related to reduction in workforce 26 million in asset impairments 06 million lease loss reserves and contract termination costs and a gain of 06 million related to the disposition of our services business 

other income expense net 

  



  

2017  compared to 2016  other expense increased by 27 million in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to a 52 million increase in net interest expense which was partially offset by a 25 million increase in other income related to foreign exchange rates 

  

2016  compared to 2015   other expense increased 19 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher interest paid due to higher average outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2016 and interest paid on an additional 25 million of term debt that funded in july 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity 

as of december 31 2017  we had 291 million  in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 387 million  cash and cash equivalents held in the united states was 208 million and consisted primarily of noninterest bearing checking deposits with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries we consider amounts held outside the us to be accessible and have provided for the estimated us income tax liability associated with the potential repatriation our foreign earnings 

actions we have taken to improve our liquidity include restructuring our operations raising additional funds the restructuring actions we have taken resulted in a 384 million reduction in ongoing operating expenses excluding restructuring charges of 169 million and 38 million in the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 in 2016 we completed a public 

offering of 13000000 shares of our common stock including the subsequent overallotment we sold approximately 15 million shares and realized net proceeds of approximately 162 million 

in december of 2016 we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement atm under which we sold shares of our common stock up to a gross aggregate offering price of 170 million we realized the full 170 million of gross proceeds available under the atm in the first quarter of 2017 

in january 2017 we completed a private placement of common stock that resulted in gross proceeds of 100 million in january 2018 we completed another private placement of common stock that resulted in additional gross proceeds of 200 million 

in july 2016 we entered into a loan and security agreement the “term loan agreement” or “original term loan agreement” with lenders that are affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners llc “tcp” which has subsequently been amended and modified as discussed below and in notes 10 “debt” and 18 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements under the agreement the lenders committed to advance a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to 250 million with a maturity date of july 1 2020 we drew down the 250 million term loan commitment at closing 

payments under the original agreement were interest only through june 30 2017 followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest beginning on july 1 2017 and continuing through the maturity date in addition we paid a commitment fee of 33 of the loan amount upon closing and a closing fee of 100 of the loan amount is payable in four equal installments at each anniversary of the closing date we may elect to prepay the loan by incurring a prepayment fee between 1 and 3 of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing and circumstances of prepayment 

the term loan agreement is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on creation of liens dispositions of assets dividends mergers or changing the nature of its business in each case subject to certain customary exceptions in addition the term loan agreement contains certain customary events of default including but not limited to failure to pay interest principal and fees or other amounts when due material breach of any representation or warranty covenant defaults cross defaults to other material indebtedness events of bankruptcy and the occurrence of a material adverse change as defined in the agreement to our business the term loan agreement offers tcp typical rights and remedies in any event of default including the ability to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable we do not expect the lender to declare default under any event including the material adverse change clause 

in february 2017 we amended our loan and security agreement with tcp to provide an additional 25 million in principal together with the term loan agreement the “combined term loans” we simultaneously terminated our revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank na the “revolver” and the combined principal and interest balance of 103 million was fully repaid 

the combined term loans have the same july 1 2020 maturity date as the original tcp loan monthly payments under the combined term loans are interest only through february 28 2018 followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest beginning on march 1 2018 and continuing through the maturity date interest on the combined term loans is the greater of a 103125 and b a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the threemonth libor rate rounded up to the nearest 116 th  of one percent plus 925 

in february 2018 the tcp loan was modified again to provide for the deferral of 50 of the scheduled principal payments in 2018 see notes 10 “debt” and 18 “subsequent events” to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

the term loans under our amended loan and security agreement with tcp are secured by a firstpriority security interest on substantially all of our assets provided however that the security interest in our intellectual property may be released when we satisfy certain requirements

as of december 31 2017  the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties was approximately 11 million since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 10 “debt” and note 14 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2017 we did not have any offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenue from sales of our microinverter systems which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway our cloudbased enlighten monitoring service and ac battery storage solutions to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners enlighten service revenue represented less than 2  of the total revenues for all periods presented 

  

revenue from sales of our products is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer iii the sale price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are generally accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded for some programs the provision is made at the later of when the related revenue is recognized or when the offer is made 

  

sales of an envoy communications gateway include the enlighten cloudbased monitoring service the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on our best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including internal costs gross margin and historical pricing practices after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using a best estimate of the selling price revenue from the sale of envoy hardware devices is recognized upon shipment assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met through september 30 2017 the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices was used to determine the period over which revenue from the cloudbased monitoring service was recognized as adequate historical user data was not available during the fourth quarter of 2017 we determined historical user data was available to adequately assess the period over which the service obligation was met as a result we shortened the estimated service period of the enlighten effective october 1 20107 from 10 years to 65 years the impact of the change in estimate was an increase to revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 26 million and a reduction of net loss per share of approximately 003

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market market is current replacement cost by purchase or by reproduction dependent on the type of inventory in cases where market exceeds net realizable value ie estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal inventories are stated at net realizable value market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin we determine cost on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory including customer demand and market conditions management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2017 2016 and 2015 were insignificant 

  

  warranty obligations 

  

microinverters sold through december 31 2013 

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product’s warranty term  15 years  for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years  for third and fourth generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used by us to estimate our warranty liability are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time ie failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time ie claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time ie replacement cost 

  

estimated failure rates— our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mtbf mean time between failure estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into operating environments we continue to monitor product performance via our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three  to nine  months between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three  to nine  months when a microinverter fails and is returned we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure via enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 

estimated claim rates— warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 

estimated replacement costs— three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time between 15  and 25  years depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

in addition to the key estimates noted above we also compare actual warranty results to expected results and evaluate any significant differences we may make additional adjustments to the warranty provision based on performance trends or other qualitative factors if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates may be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material 

  

fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1 2014 

  

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provide us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty under accounting standards codification “asc” 825—financial instruments “fair value option” an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years  

  

we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result the expected present value technique an income approach converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our creditadjusted riskfree rate see note 8 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

  

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” which requires most entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value nrv this simplifies the evaluation from the current method of lower of cost or market where market is based on one of three measures ie replacement cost net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin asu 201511 does not apply to inventories measured under the lastin firstout method or the retail inventory method and defines nrv as the “estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation” this standard which was adopted in the first quarter of 2017 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” which will simplify the income tax consequences accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statements of consolidated cash flows this standard which was adopted in the first quarter of 2017 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” this asu simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill the fasb eliminated step 2 from the goodwill impairment test under the amendments in this asu an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit additionally an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable the fasb also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and if it fails that qualitative test to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test therefore the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units an entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary a public business entity that is an sec filer should adopt the amendments in this update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 we adopted asu 201704 for the year beginning january 1 2017 we have a single reporting unit and adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in august 2015 march 2016 april 2016 may 2016 and 

december 2016 collectively “topic 606” topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the standard is effective for and was adopted by us on january 1 2018 

the updated standard’s core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard generally requires an entity to identify performance obligations in its contracts estimate the amount of variable consideration to be received in the transaction price allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and recognize revenue as obligations are satisfied in addition the updated standard requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts 

the guidance permits two methods of adoption the full retrospective method applying the standard to each prior reporting period presented or the modified retrospective method with a cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application upon adoption we will use the modified retrospective method with a cumulative catch up adjustment to accumulated deficit and will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous gaap in our 2018 consolidated financial statements 

the most significant impacts upon adoption of the standard will be how we account for revenue related to our envoy communications device and related enlighten service and the timing of when certain sales incentives will be recognized under asc 605 our monitoring hardware and service are considered two units of accounting with a portion of the consideration related to the hardware recognized upfront and the remaining deferred over the estimated service period under asc 606 the full consideration for these products represents a single performance obligation and is deferred over the estimated service period this treatment will result in an increase in deferred revenue of approximately 77 million an increase in deferred costs of approximately 43 million and an increase in accumulated deficit of approximately 34 million upon adoption of asc 606 

under asc 605 we recorded certain contra revenue promotions at the later of the date revenue was recognized or the date at which the promotional offer was extended under asc 606 all such contra revenue programs will be treated as variable consideration and recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded this change in timing will result in an increase in accrued liabilities of approximately 6 million and an increase to accumulated deficit in the same amount upon adoption of asc 606 the change in accounting treatment affects the timing of the recognition of certain contra revenue programs but the overall income statement impact of this new accounting method is expected to be immaterial 

under asc 605 we expensed commission costs as incurred the new standard requires upfront contract acquisition costs such as sales commissions to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the asset under the new guidance we will utilize the practical expedient permitting expensing of costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less which typically results in expensing commissions paid commissions related to our sale of monitoring hardware and service will be capitalized and amortized over the period of the associated revenue which is 65 years this treatment will result in an increase in deferred costs of approximately 08 million and an increase in accumulated deficit by the same amount upon adoption of asc 606 the amortization of these deferred costs is immaterial to our income statement 

we do not expect the adoption of asc 606 to have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognition related to specific customer contracts 

  

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which amends certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments changes to the current guidance include the accounting for equity investments the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments and the assessment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to availableforsale securities in addition asu 201601 establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected under this guidance an entity would be required to separately present in other comprehensive income the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrumentspecific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings asu 201601 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 and upon adoption an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first 

reporting period in which the guidance is effective early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrumentspecific credit risk in other comprehensive income we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in february 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards codification “asc” 842 “asc 842” “leases” which replaces the existing guidance in asc 840 leases asc 842 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 asc 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a rightofuse rou asset and a corresponding lease liability for finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the rou asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straightline total lease expense we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

in november 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201618 asu 201618 “statement of cash flows” which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows asu 201618 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2017 the fasb issued asu 201709 asu 201709 compensation  stock compensation asu 201709 was issued to provide clarity and reduce both 1 diversity in practice and 2 cost and complexity when applying the guidance in topic 718 to a change in the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award asu 201709 provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting under topic 718 asu 201709 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure primarily from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros indian rupee and australian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european indian australian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

we have utilized foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to anticipated cash receipts from expected future revenues denominated in euros and intercompany transaction gains or losses the contracts we enter into typically have maturities of less than one year we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes any foreign currency forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations we were not party to any foreign currency contracts as of december 31 2016 and we did not enter into any foreign currency forward contracts during 2017 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the aggregate gross notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts all with maturities of less than one year was 00 million we recorded 00 million 01 million and 03 million of net gains in 2017  2016  and 2015 respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts

 item 1 business 

our company 

we deliver simple innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy  our semiconductorbased microinverter system converts direct current dc electricity to alternating current ac electricity at the individual solar module level and brings a systembased high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors networking and cloudbased software technologies our technology was designed to increase energy production simplify design and installation improve system uptime and reliability reduce fire risk and provide a platform for intelligent energy management since inception we have shipped more than 13 million microinverters representing over 3 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic pv generating capacity and more than 580000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 100 countries   

we were incorporated as pvi solutions inc in march 2006 in the state of delaware and changed our name to enphase energy inc in july 2007 

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic or pv installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter as compared to microinverter systems we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar systems including the following 



specialized equipment such as dc combiners conduits and disconnects in addition the use of highvoltage dc requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology 

 these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

 our products 

we design develop manufacture and sell home energy solutions that connect solar generation energy storage and management on one intelligent platform we have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductorbased microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies provides advanced energy monitoring and control this is vastly different than the central inverter approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array in 2016 we expanded our product offerings by launching the enphase ac battery a homebased energy storage system that homeowners can add to new or existing solar pv systems 

with the introduction of the enphase home energy solution we bring a high technology   networked approach to solar generation plus energy storage by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors and cloudbased software technologies our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home’s energy potential while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities unlike our core competitors who utilize a singlepoint or traditional inverter   or offer separate components of solutions we have builtin system redundancy in both pv generation and energy storage eliminating the risk that comes with a singlepoint of failure further   the nature of our cloudbased monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates enabling costeffective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance 

the enphase home energy solution consists of four key components  enphase microinverters the ac battery an envoy gateway and enlighten cloudbased software 



performance and enhanced features we have announced manufacturer partnerships that integrate our next generation iq microinverter into a pv module to create an ac module that will further simplify system design and installation 

   

key benefits of our home energy solution include 

  

truly integrated  the enphase home energy solution is a fully integrated solar generation plus storage offering from one provider designed and manufactured to work together the home energy solution is a truly integrated home energy solution 

higher performance our microinverter system delivers higher performance by maximizing the energy production of each module a microinverter at each module overcomes issues such as module mismatch and soiling or shading which can have a significant impact on string inverter systems enphase microinverters also provide greater system availability with no singlepoint of failure an independent analysis from pv evolution labs has concluded an enphase microinverter system yields higher performance over systems with string inverters or traditional inverters we believe that our microinverter systems achieve higher energy production and can generate superior returns on investment relative to competitive solutions for system owners   

  

simplified design and installation the allac infrastructure simplifies the design process and eliminates the typical costs of a complicated dc voltage system for pv or storage   in addition our microinverters are installed on the roof and hidden from view   with minimal impact to the aesthetics of a home or building we also offer additional tools such as the enphase installer toolkit mobile app or the enphase ac combiner box to further improve installation time and reduce balance of system materials costs   

  

enhanced safety    microinverters and ac batteries are safer because they process low voltage dc and are isolated to the module level leading to an allac architecture our microinverter system does not contain any of the high voltages common to string inverter systems high voltage arc faults associated with string or traditional inverters are the leading cause of fires of solar pv installations microinverter technology mitigates this safety risk   

reduced operations and maintenance costs our microinverter system is highly reliable with one million poweron hours of testing incorporated into our microinverter design this high reliability   plus a distributed architecture means ongoing operations and maintenance do not require emergency truck rolls unlike string inverter or traditional inverters which have a 100 probability of failure leading to full replacement within 10 to 12 years in addition with modulelevel monitoring capabilities remote maintenance can pinpoint issues thus reducing any time on site finally   the networkednature of our 

system enables us to remotely update the firmware and software of the microinverters reducing ongoing utility compliance costs   

  

our strategy 

our objective is to be the leading provider of energy management solutions for the solar industry worldwide key elements of our strategy include 

 customers and sales 

we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets  we sell our microinverter systems primarily to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators who in turn integrate our products into complete solar pv installations for residential and commercial system owners we work with many of the leading solar and electrical distributors in addition to our distributors we sell directly to large installers oems and strategic partners our oem customers include solar module manufacturers who bundle our products and solutions with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers strategic partners include a variety of companies including industrial equipment suppliers and providers of solar financing solutions in 2016 ced greentech accounted for approximately 18 of net revenues historically revenues generated from the us market have represented more than 80 of our total revenue   

manufacturing quality control and key suppliers 

we outsource the manufacturing of our products to manufacturing partners flextronics international ltd assembles and tests our microinverter ac battery and envoy products prices for such services are mutually agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the agreement flextronics also provides receiving kitting storage transportation inventory visibility and other valueadded logistics services at locations managed by flextronics phoenix contact gmbh  co kg manufactures our custom ac cables eliiy power co ltd provides the chemistry for our ac battery storage solution in addition we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our microinverter system 

customer service 

we maintain high levels of customer engagement through our customer support group and the enlighten cloudbased software portal and have cultivated an organizational focus on customer satisfaction our dedicated customer support group focuses on responding to inbound inquiries regarding any of our products and services 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the 

cost and optimize the effectiveness of our energy management solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development against metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and easeofuse 

our research and development expenses were 507 million  508 million  and 454 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2016 we had 92 issued us patents 57 issued foreign patents 23 pending us patent applications and 14 pending foreign counterpart patent applications our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2027 and 2033 

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our asics pursuant to a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any third party manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market the license carries a seventyfive year term subject to earlier termination upon mutual agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices or cplds and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

with respect to among other things proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

  

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us   

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our microinverter technology or business plans 

seasonality 

historically sales of our products in the second third and to a lesser extent fourth quarters have been positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles followed by a seasonally softer first quarter  although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers and new technology startups the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

 competitors in the inverter market are amongst others sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh abb ltd and solaredge technologies inc and other emerging companies offering alternative microinverter dc to dc optimizer and other power electronic solutions  we principally compete with the large incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to our microinverter solution we believe however that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central or string inverter technology even when traditional central or string inverter technology is supplemented by dctodc optimizers competitors in the storage market are currently emerging and may include producers of battery cells and other integrated storage systems

 item 1a   risk factors 

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we have disclosed our conclusion under asu 201415 “presentation of financial statements  going concern” that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our plans to mitigate the conditions that led to that conclusion therefore we may need to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 

 we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us and the determination that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern could impair our ability to raise financing if needed if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations enhance our research and development and sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events including unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders if we fail to raise sufficient additional capital if needed we may not be able to completely execute our business plan and may not be able to continue as a going concern  

we have a history of losses which may continue in the future and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability or be able to continue as a going concern 

we have incurred substantial net losses since our inception and we may continue to incur additional losses in the future for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we incurred net losses of 675 million  221 million  and 81 million  respectively at december 31 2016  we had an accumulated deficit of 2505 million  our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our offerings increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in connection with the issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 we concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern while we have taken and continue to take steps to improve our financial position since december 31 2016 including raising additional capital and further reducing expenses there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient and we could fail to continue as a going concern furthermore if we require additional capital to finance our operations this determination could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity incurring debt or other financing alternatives 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

the rapidly changing solar industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing 

companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer 

our microinverter and ac battery storage systems are utilized in solar photovoltaic or pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years   and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 

 if demand for solar energy solutions does not grow demand for our customers products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology have recently caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of lowercost manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2016 ced greentech accounted for approximately 18 of total net revenues in 2015 ced greentech and vivint solar inc accounted for approximately 17 and 12 of total net revenues respectively our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements generally do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period in addition these customers may decide to no longer use or to reduce the use of our products and services for other reasons that may be out of our control for example beginning in 2015 vivint solar inc implemented a multisourcing 

strategy and therefore is not solesourcing our microinverters which has resulted in and may continue to result in a reduction in our revenue generated from sales to vivint in addition adverse events affecting our customers could also adversely affect our revenue and results of operations for instance the recent filing of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection by one of our customers prevented us from timely collection of our accounts receivable from that customer the loss of or events affecting vivint or one or more of our other large customers have had could have and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

we are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our gross margins 

the solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time we have reduced the prices of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future including from our major customers in addition we have reduced our prices ahead of planned cost reductions of our products which has adversely affected our gross margins when seeking to maintain or increase their market share our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products in addition our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our gross margins would continue to be adversely affected 

given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological change a principal component of our business strategy is reducing the costs to manufacture our products to remain competitive if our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the efficiency of their products our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency further if raw materials costs and other thirdparty component costs were to increase we may not meet our cost reduction targets if we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap we may not be able to remain price competitive which would result in lost market share and lower gross margins 

the inverter industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce products which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share 

the market for pv inverter solutions is highly competitive to date we have competed primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers but as the solar industry rapidly grows new solutions and technologies are emerging that will directly compete with our business competitors in the inverter market include amongst others sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh abb ltd and solaredge technologies inc other existing or emerging companies such as huawei technologies co ltd may also begin offering alternative microinverter dc to dc optimizer and other power electronic solutions 

competition has intensified and we expect the trend to continue as new and existing competitors enter the microinverter market or market and sell related products such as dc to dc optimizers that can be used in conjunction with central or string inverters sma solar technology ag and abb ltd market and sell microinverter products and several new entrants to the microinverter market have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products we believe that a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our microinverter systems in the modulelevel power electronics or mlpe market including lowcost manufacturers such as huawei technologies co ltd in addition central and string inverter manufacturers continue to reduce their prices putting additional pressure on us and other alternative technologies 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger than we are and may have greater financial marketing distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition especially in certain markets in addition some of our competitors have more resources and experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and creating market awareness for these offerings further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices of our products in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipate or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

we also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally for instance sunpower corporation acquired a microinverter company solarbridge technologies inc in november of 2014 other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform dc to ac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our microinverter systems or sell products that compete with our microinverters systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

our microinverter systems including our ac battery storage solution may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share 

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 

 in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central or string inverters these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central or string inverter systems which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our microinverter systems 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries most notably australia canada france belgium germany italy japan the people’s republic of china spain and the united states have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs or fits rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions that we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place additionally electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

actions by the new presidential administration with regard to the solar energy sector or international trade agreements could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the recent change in the us presidential administration may create regulatory uncertainty in the clean energy sector generally and the solar energy sector in particular if the new administration andor the us congress take action to eliminate or reduce legislation regulations and incentives supporting solar energy such actions may result in a decrease in demand for solar energy in the united states and other geographical markets which could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore a significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries including mexico canada and china during the 2016 election campaign the new president made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements including the north american free trade agreement “nafta” at this time it remains unclear what the new administration or the us congress may or may not do with respect to these international trade agreements if the new administration takes action to impose any border tariff or to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or certain other international trade agreements our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses any of which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and cost efficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications 

to date we have generated the majority of our revenues from north america and expect to continue to generate a substantial amount of our revenues from north america in the future there are a number of important incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products a substantial majority of our revenues come from the united states which has both federal and state incentives for instance the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 currently provides a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 and reduced tax credits of 26 and 22 through december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning in 2022 these tax credits could be reduced or 

eliminated as part of tax code changes or regulatory reform initiatives by the new congress and presidential administration 

in addition net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and in some instances modified which may have a negative impact on future inverter sales we derive a significant portion of our revenues from california’s residential solar market and the existing california net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of residential solar systems california however is reevaluating existing incentives tariffs and rates for residential systems in order to accommodate a sustainable growth trajectory for residential solar and to also encourage the adoption of other distributed energy resources such as energy storage that provide additional benefits to the consumer and the electricity grid there is a risk that future regulatory changes do not adequately stimulate future growth in the residential solar market we also sell our products in europe a number of european countries including germany belgium spain italy and the united kingdom have adopted reductions or concluded their fit programs certain countries notably greece and spain have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe 

we also sell our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a renewable energy target ret that is intended to ensure that 33000 gigawatthours of australias electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020 in 2013 australia elected a new national government the new leadership pledged to revise national energy policy including potentially reducing australia’s renewable energy target and revising certain renewable energy financing mechanisms in july 2014 the new leadership successfully repealed the tax on carbon emissions this has been replaced with the direct action plan which primarily provides funding to corporations to reduce emissions states and territories in australia have different feed in tariffs and the gradual reduction of feed in tariffs in some states may reduce the incentive for homeowners to export unused solar energy produced back to the grid 

we also sell our products in ontario canada the government of ontario has the authority to change the fits for future contracts at its discretion and has the authority to modify suspend or discontinue the program at any time suspension of the fit program in ontario directly impacted and could continue to impact our business furthermore any future suspension or modification of the program could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe the federal and state tax credits applicable federal and state grants applicable tariffs and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception however unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential solar market the phaseout of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future the reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy including local content requirements have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business domestically and abroad additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example the italian energy authority aeeg enacted a new set of interconnection standards for solar energy installations that became effective in july 2012 which has negatively impacted our sales in italy we continue to explore potential solutions to meet these requirements however in the event that we cannot 

implement a solution in the near term the total market available for our microinverter products in italy and our business as a result may continue to be adversely impacted 

in addition several states or territories including california hawaii and queensland australia have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar systems that we may not be able to currently comply with in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks for our business 

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including the sovereign debt issues in europe pose risks for our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have reduced demand for solar products the european sovereign debt crisis has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales in europe 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and lowering sales of our products in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar components industry including manufacturers of central inverters and dc to dc optimizers could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to make installation or operation of solar distributed generation more costly such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our microinverter systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to continue to incur additional warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue and gross profit to decline 

we have offered 15year limited warranties for our first and second generation microinverters and offer a limited warranty of up to 25 years on each subsequent generation microinverters our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our microinverters under normal use and service conditions for up to 25 years following installation as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized revenue our estimated costs of warranty for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty 

while we offer warranties of up to 25 years our microinverters have only been in use since mid2008 when we first commenced commercial sales of our products although we conduct accelerated life cycle testing to measure performance and reliability our microinverter systems have not been tested over the full warranty cycle and do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life in addition under realworld operating conditions which may vary by location and design as well as insolation soiling and weather conditions a typical solar pv installation may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions if our products perform below expectations or have unexpected reliability problems we may be unable to gain or retain customers and could face substantial warranty expense 

we are required to make assumptions and apply judgments based on our accelerated life cycle testing and the limited operating history of our products regarding a number of factors including the durability and reliability of our products our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the costs of replacement of defective products our assumptions have proved and could in the future prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our products which has caused and may in the future cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products increases in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to actual product failure rates field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting product failures have caused and could in the future cause us to materially increase the amount of warranty obligations and have had and may have in the future a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations 

we also depend significantly on our reputation for reliability and highquality products and services exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business if our products and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired and we may lose or be unable to gain or retain customers 

defects and poor performance in our products could result in loss of customers decreased revenue and unexpected expenses and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

our products must meet stringent quality requirements and may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product these errors or defects may be dangerous as defective power components may cause power overloads potentially resulting in explosion or fire as we develop new generations of our products and enter new markets we face higher risk of undetected defects because our testing protocols may not be able to fully test the products under all possible operating conditions in the past we have experienced defects in our products due to certain errors in the manufacturing and design process any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts in order to address or remedy any defects and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

furthermore defective inefficient or poorly performing power components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim also we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain this coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty and product liability claims or product recalls may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems based on our product platform may contain undetected errors failures or bugs especially when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our monitoring service could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses 

if we are unable to effectively manage our workforce our business and operating results may suffer 

we have experienced and expect to experience in the future volatility in our sales and operations our historical growth and our more recent cost reduction initiatives have placed and are expected to continue to place significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources to 

 we cannot assure you that our current and planned operations personnel systems internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations if we cannot manage our sales and operations effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations business or prospects 

our recent and planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets we recently introduced our ac battery storage solution in australia the united states and the united kingdom we intend to expand into other international markets our success in these new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 



further new geographic markets and the larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

 failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these products to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

ordering patterns from our distributors may cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period 

our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their assessment of endcustomer demand and their forecasts because these forecasts may not be accurate channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly due to the difference between their forecasts and actual demand as a result distributors adjust their purchase orders placed with us in response to changing channel inventory levels as well as their assessment of the latest market demand trends we have limited visibility into future end customer demand a significant decrease in our distributors’ channel inventory in one period may lead to a significant rebuilding of channel inventory in subsequent periods or vice versa which may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly this fluctuation may cause our results to fall short of analyst or investor expectations in a certain period which may cause our stock price to decline 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products in particular we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of microinverter products cabling and our communications gateway related to our microinverter systems our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our other manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which the vast majority of our microinverters related cabling and communications gateway products are manufactured are located outside of the united states we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the united states increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our relationships with our distributors and end customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in our manufacturing partner’s fabrication facility due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes or those of some thirdparty contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of production lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension of manufacturing production lines could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components of our products for example our asics are purchased from a sole source supplier or developed for us by sole source suppliers similarly the battery cells for our ac battery storage products are also currently sole sourced any of the sole source and limited source suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues could stop producing our components cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may 

not be available on commercially reasonable terms including price or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of sole source or limited source components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business 

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if potential owners of solar pv systems based on our product platform are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms we could experience a reduction in the demand for our solar pv systems 

many owners of solar pv systems depend on financing to purchase their systems the limited use of microinverters to date coupled with our relatively smaller size and capitalization compared to some of our competitors could result in lenders refusing to provide the financing necessary to purchase solar pv systems based on our product platform on favorable terms or at all moreover in the case of debt financed projects even if lenders are willing to finance the purchase of these systems an increase in interest rates or a change in tax incentives could make it difficult for owners to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all in addition we believe that a significant percentage of owners purchase solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of upfront cash and financing difficulties in obtaining financing for solar pv systems on favorable terms or increases in interest rates or changes in tax incentives could lower an investor’s return on investment in a solar pv system or make alternative solar pv systems or other investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems based on our product platform any of these events could result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant share of residential solar installations has been provided through third party financing structures such as power purchase or lease agreements our sales growth may depend on sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings who provide solar as a service via power purchase agreements or leasing structures the third party finance market for residential solar in the united states and elsewhere is or may become highly concentrated with a few significant finance companies and several smaller entrants if we are unable develop relationships and gain a significant share of inverter sales to the major finance companies or new entrants our overall sales growth could be constrained 

we rely primarily on distributors large installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties and as a result many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to 

sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by these customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

we may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing 

we are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets we have made investments in our infrastructure increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so any new product is subject to certain risks including component sourcing strategic partner selection and execution customer acceptance competition product differentiation market timing challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow if we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new product introductions these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline projected thus having a materially adverse impact on our revenue operating results and financial stability in addition we are pursuing new geographic markets the inability to capture new customers in the highgrowth geographic markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success in an “ac module” version of our microinverter system may depend in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers 

we are currently working on variants of our microinverter system that will enable an “ac module” for direct attachment of the microinverter to the solar modules the market success of such solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with solar module manufacturers to design solar modules that are compatible with such direct attachment of our microinverter we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions combining our microinverter system and solar modules for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial changes faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled technical people is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business if we fail to retain our senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business could suffer 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect 

our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the united states and in certain other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the united states we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade secrets in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against certain of our competitors from time to time we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the united states and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent applications an adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

 any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

from time to time we have licensed and in the future we may choose to or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products we cannot assure that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with applicable open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code any of the foregoing could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles 

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months such as northern europe canada and the united states in general we expect our products in the second third and fourth quarters will be positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles preceded by a seasonally softer first quarter in the united states customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future 

covenants in our credit facility and term loan may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

we are a party to a term loan agreement with affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners llc “tcp” this agreement restricts our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt encumbering our tangible or intangible property paying dividends or engaging in certain transactions such as mergers and acquisitions investments and asset sales these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under these agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets excluding intellectual property which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness and the forfeiture of our assets subject to security interests in favor of the lenders 

we are an “emerging growth company” and have elected to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which could make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act enacted in april 2012 or the jobs act we have chosen to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we can continue to be an “emerging growth company” until december 31 2017 the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering although we could cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier if certain events occur as specified in the jobs act such as our achieving annual revenue of at least 1 billion or our becoming a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule 12b2 of the exchange act we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we have chosen to take advantage of these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act has required and will continue to require significant attention of management although we are currently not required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting otherwise required by section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act this exemption will no longer be available to us beginning with our first annual report on 10k for the year in which we cease to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in the future the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price in addition a delay in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions including sec action ineligibility for short form resale registration the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the stock exchange on which it is listed and the inability of registered brokerdealers to make a market in our common stock which would further reduce our stock price and could harm our business to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our ability to use net operating losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the internal revenue code and may be subject to further limitation as a result of future transactions 

sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a more than 50 percentage point increase in the percentage of its stock owned by certain stockholders over a threeyear period to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in the years after the ownership change these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders who directly or indirectly own 5 or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company generally if an ownership change occurs the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change if these limitations apply we may be unable to offset our taxable income with net operating losses or our tax liability with credits before these losses and credits expire we recently completed a study to assess whether an 

ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation under the code however we do not anticipate these limitations will significantly impact our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 

in addition it is possible that future transactions including issuances of new shares of our common stock and sales of shares of our common stock will cause us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes in that event we generally would not be able to use our net operating losses from periods prior to this ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by sections 382 and 383 and those attributes that are already subject to limitations as a result of our prior ownership changes may be subject to more stringent limitations 

natural disasters terrorist or cyber attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in petaluma california is located near major earthquake fault lines further a terrorist attack including one aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our cloudbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products in the event that an earthquake tsunami typhoon terrorist or cyber attack or other natural manmade or technical catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business a disruption infiltration or failure of our information technology systems as a result of software or hardware malfunctions system implementations or upgrades computer viruses cyber attacks thirdparty security breaches employee error theft or misuse malfeasance power disruptions natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner customer and employee personal data we have been and may in the future be subject to fraud attempts from outside parties through our electronic systems such as “phishing” email communications to our finance technical or other personnel which could put 

us at risk for harm from fraud theft or other loss if our internal controls do not operate as intended any of these events could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america europe australia and other markets we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter this variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations these fluctuations are due to numerous factors including 



 the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors collectively own a significant percentage of our common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock all outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely 

tradable without restriction under the securities act any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition our term loan agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends consequently an investor’s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as “may” “will” “should” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “predict” “intend” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology for example statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance expense levels and liquidity sources are forwardlooking statements our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

we deliver simple innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy  we were founded in march 2006 and are a market leader in the microinverter category of the us inverter market our technology was designed to increase energy production simplify design and installation improve system uptime and reliability reduce fire risk and provide a platform for intelligent energy management since inception we have shipped more than 13 million microinverters representing over 3 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic pv generating capacity and more than 580000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 100 countries 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers “oems” and strategic partners historically revenues generated from the us market have represented more than 80 of our total revenue   

our first commercial shipment occurred in mid2008 our net revenues were  3226 million  3572 million  and 3439 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we incurred net losses of 675 million  221 million  and 81 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively as of december 31 2016 we had 178 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of  351 million  

although we have taken and are taking actions to improve our liquidity and help us achieve profitability the solar market is volatile and we are subject to market dynamics that are beyond our control based on our cash position at december 31 2016 and our recent operating losses we have concluded that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year if we require additional capital to finance our operations this determination could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity incurring debt or other financing alternatives if we fail to raise sufficient additional capital if needed we may not be able to completely execute our business plan 

         we have seen a decline in the average selling price asp of our products that has been more rapid in the last eight quarters than what has been typical in the past the decline in asp is primarily the result of our decision to lower product pricing in advance of anticipated product cost savings to grow market share as expected the decrease in asp has resulted in lower net revenues gross profit and gross margins and has negatively impacted our liquidity 

we launched our next generation microinverter the enphase home energy solution with iq in march 2017 this microinverter is a major milestone in our product cost reduction initiative and we believe it will lower our product cost and simultaneously add new features and functionality we also introduced our ac battery storage system in australia in the third quarter of 2016 and in the us and europe in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we believe the solar power storage market has significant growth potential 

we have taken a number of actions to reduce our operating expenses including a reduction in our global workforce in the third quarter of 2016 and in january 2017 we also eliminated certain projects that did not have a nearterm return on investment and we have consolidated office space at our headquarters we expect the cumulative impact of these actions to decrease our annualized ongoing operating expenses by approximately 40 million as compared to prerestructuring annualized operating expenses and we expect to realize the full benefit of these cost reduction actions in the second quarter of 2017 

although we have taken actions to reduce our operating expenses we also continued to invest substantial resources to support our business including enhancing our research and development operations to drive product cost reductions as well as developing technological innovations and new products marketing and selling our products and expanding into new product markets and geographies at december 31 2016  we had 430  employees 

components of consolidated statements of operations 

net revenues 

we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems and related accessories which include microinverter units ac battery storage systems an envoy communications gateway and our enlighten cloudbased monitoring service 

our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems and related accessories supply and demand sales incentives and competitive product offerings our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by remaining cost competitive developing and introducing new products that meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers the diversification and expansion of our revenue base and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs warranty manufacturing personnel and logistics costs freight costs depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs our product costs are impacted by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation certain costs primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products for the foreseeable future however shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products we contract with third parties including one of our contract manufacturers to serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the united states europe and asia 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product cost product mix warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative and restructuring expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes recruiting costs sales commissions incentive compensation and stockbased compensation 

research and development expense includes personnelrelated expenses thirdparty design and development costs testing and evaluation costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs research and development employees are primarily engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors powerline communications networking and software functionality and storage we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs improve functionality and enhance reliability we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position 

sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnelrelated expenses such as salaries commissions stockbased compensation employee benefits and travel it also includes trade shows marketing customer support and other indirect costs we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors large installers oems and strategic partners we currently offer 

microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets  we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future 

  

general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries incentive compensation stockbased compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services which consist primarily of outside legal accounting and information technology consulting costs 

restructuring charges are the net of charges resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in 2016 to improve operational performance and reduce overall operating expense and gain on divestiture of our services business costs included in restructuring primarily consist of severance for workforce reduction actions noncash charges related to the disposition of assets and impairment of property and equipment and the establishment of lease loss reserves see note 9 “restructuring and other charges” for additional information 

other expense net 

other expense net primarily consists of interest expense and commitment fees under our revolving credit facility term loans and noncash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs other expense net also includes gains or losses upon conversion of foreign currency transactions into us dollars 

provision for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products historically we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly due to the history of losses we have generated in the united states since inception we believe that it is morelikelythannot that all of our us and state deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31 2016  

summary consolidated statements of operations 

  

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented in thousands 

  



comparison of 2016  2015  and 2014   

  

net revenues 

  



  

2016  compared to 2015  net revenues decreased by 10 to 3226 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  the number of microinverter units sold increased slightly in 2016 and was approximately 31 million units in both 2016  and 2015  net revenues decreased yearoveryear primarily due to a decline in the average selling price per watt for microinverters shipped of approximately 24 in 2016  compared to 2015  we expect the average selling price per watt of microinverters to continue to decline 

  

2015  compared to 2014  net revenues increased by 4  to 3572 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  the number of microinverter units sold increased by 19 from 26 million units in 2014  to 31 million units in 2015  net revenues grew yearoveryear at a slower pace than units sold due to a decline in the average selling price average selling prices per watt for microinverters shipped declined approximately 15 in 2015  compared to 2014  

  

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  



  

2016  compared to 2015  cost of revenues increased by 6  in 2016  as compared to 2015  and was primarily attributable to a shift in product mix that resulted in increased sales of higherpriced accessories including our ac battery storage system gross margin decreased by 123 percentage points to 180  in 2016  as compared to 303  in 2015  while we experienced an overall reduction in our product costs the adoption of a more aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decrease to our gross margin in 2016  our gross margin also included the impact of higher warranty expense as compared to 2015  the higher warranty expense in 2016 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates which reduced gross margin by 12 percentage points see note 7 “warranty obligations” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

2015  compared to 2014   cost of revenues increased by 8  in 2015  as compared to 2014  and was attributable to the greater volume of shipments of our products gross margin decreased by 26 percentage points to 303 in 2015  as compared to 329 in 2014  while we experienced a reduction in our product costs the adoption of a more aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decrease to our gross margin in 2015  our gross margin included the benefit of lower warranty expense as compared to 2014  the higher warranty expense in 2014 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates which reduced gross margin by 24 percentage points see note 7 “warranty obligations” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

research and development 

  



  

2016  compared to 2015  research and development expenses decreased by 01 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  the decrease is primarily due to decreased compensation costs and depreciation expense as a result of the restructuring actions taken in september 2016 the decrease was partially offset by higher outside professional fees utilized to support the development of new products as well as enhancements and cost reductions to existing products although the amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity we expect it to decrease in the nearterm as we realize the full benefits of our operating expense reduction initiatives 

  

2015  compared to 2014   research and development expenses increased by 54 million in 2015  as compared to 2014  this increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development headcount which resulted in increased expense of 39 million from salaries and stockbased compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs in addition there was an increase in outside contract services of 10 million to support the development of new products as well as enhancements and cost reductions to existing products the remaining increase of 05 million was attributed to higher depreciation and amortization related to research and development equipment 

  

sales and marketing 

  



  

2016  compared to 2015  sales and marketing expenses decreased by 71 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  the decrease was primarily due to an 84 million decrease in compensation costs as a result of lower headcount and a 14 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives these decreases were partially offset by a 16 million increase in bad debt expense and a 18 million benefit related to a revaluation of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration liability that was recorded in 2015 we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in the near term as we realize the full benefits of the cost savings initiatives we have implemented 

  

2015  compared to 2014   sales and marketing expenses increased by 49 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount during the first nine months of 2015 which resulted in increased expense of 40 million from salaries and stockbased compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs other increases include a 13 million increase in bad debt expense 07 million in marketing and consulting expenses and a 07 million increase in facilities related costs these increases were partially offset by a 18 million benefit related to a revaluation of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration liability 

  

general and administrative 

  



  

2016  compared to 2015  general and administrative expenses decreased by 34 million in 2016  as compared to 2015  the decrease was primarily the result of a 17 million reduction in compensation costs due to lower headcount a 02 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and a 18 million reduction in professional services which was primarily attributable to lower legal and other professional fees this decrease was partially offset by a 04 million increase in corporate expenses including rent utilities and depreciation we expect general and administrative expenses to decline in the near term as we realize the benefits of the cost savings initiatives we have implemented 

  

2015  compared to 2014   general and administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2015 as compared to 2016 personnelrelated costs decreased 25 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 this decrease was offset by a 14 million increase related to corporatelevel expenses including rent utilities and depreciation related to corporate fixed assets a 05 million increase in recruiting costs and a 03 million increase in professional services costs 

restructuring and other charges 

  



  

2016  compared to 2015  in 2016 restructuring and other charges included 13 million of severance and other costs related to reduction in workforce 26 million in asset impairments 06 million lease loss reserves and contract termination costs and a gain of 06 million related to the disposition of our services business we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in 2017 as we continue to take actions to reduce operating expenses 

  

other income expense net 

  



  

2016  compared to 2015  other expense increased by 19 million in 2016  as compared to 2015  primarily as a result of higher interest paid due to higher average outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility in 2016 and interest paid on an additional 25 million of term debt that funded in july 2016 

  

2015  compared to 2014   other expense decreased 29 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of lower interest paid due to the full repayment of our term loan with hercules technology growth capital inc in december 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2016  we had 178 million  in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 351 million  cash and cash equivalents held in the united states was 96 million and consisted primarily of noninterest bearing checking deposits with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries we consider amounts held outside the us to be accessible and have provided for the estimated us income tax liability associated with the potential repatriation our foreign earnings 

although we have taken actions to improve our liquidity and help us achieve profitability the solar market is volatile and we are subject to market dynamics that are beyond our control based on our cash position at december 31 2016 and our recent operating losses we have concluded that substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 are presented on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty information about the actions we have taken and are taking to mitigate our liquidity constraints is presented below 

actions we have taken to reduce our operating expenses include a reduction in our global workforce in third quarter of 2016 and a second reduction in january of 2017 we also eliminated certain projects that did not have a nearterm return on investment consolidated office space at our headquarters and divested our services business we expect the cumulative impact of these actions to decrease our operating expenses by approximately 35 and we expect to realize the full benefit beginning in the second quarter of 2017 

sources of liquidity 

we have taken and are taking actions to improve our liquidity including raising funds in the capital markets in 2016 we completed a public offering of 13000000 shares of our common stock including the subsequent overallotment we sold approximately 15 million shares and realized net proceeds of approximately 162 million 

in december of 2016 we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement atm under which we may sell shares of our common stock up to a gross aggregate offering price of 170 million we are not obligated to make any sales of the shares under the sales agreement as of december 31 2016 we had not sold any shares under the atm we will have realized the full 170 million of gross proceeds available under the atm at the time of this filing 

in january 2017 we completed a private placement of common stock that resulted in gross proceeds of 100 million 

in july 2016 we entered into a loan and security agreement the “term loan agreement” or “original term loan agreement” with lenders that are affiliates of tennenbaum capital partners llc “tcp” which has subsequently been amended and modified as discussed below and in notes 10 “debt” and 18 “subsequent event” under the agreement the lenders committed to advance a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to 250 million with a maturity date of july 1 2020 we drew down the 250 million term loan commitment at closing 

payments under the original agreement are interest only through june 30 2017 followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal plus accrued interest beginning on july 1 2017 and continuing through the maturity date the original term loan agreement provides for an interest rate per annum equal to the higher of i 1025 or ii libor plus 95625 subject to a 10 reduction if we achieve minimum levels of revenue and ebitda each as defined in the term loan agreement for the twelveconsecutive month period ending june 30 2017 as set forth in the term loan agreement in addition we paid a commitment fee of 33 of the loan amount upon closing and a closing fee of 100 of the loan amount is payable in four equal installments at each anniversary of the closing date we may elect to prepay the loan by incurring a prepayment fee between 1 and 3 of the principal amount of the term loan depending on the timing and circumstances of prepayment 

the term loan is secured by a secondpriority security interest on substantially all our assets except intellectual property the term loan agreement does not contain any financial covenants but is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on creation of liens dispositions of assets dividends mergers or changing the nature of its business in each case subject to certain customary exceptions in addition the term loan agreement contains certain customary events of default including but not limited to failure to pay interest principal and fees or other amounts when due material breach of any representation or warranty covenant defaults cross defaults to other material indebtedness events of bankruptcy and the occurrence of a material adverse change as defined in the agreement to our business the term loan agreement offers tcp typical rights and remedies in any event of default including the ability to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable we do not expect the lender to declare default under any event including the material adverse change clause 

in 2016 we had a 500 million  revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank na “wells fargo” that was entered into on november 7 2012 as first amended on february 14 2014 on december 18 2015 we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with wells fargo the “revolver” which extended the maturity date from november 7 2016 to november 7 2019 and added an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility by 250 million  subject to certain approvals and meeting certain criteria 

availability under the revolver was subject to a borrowing base calculation that limits availability to a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus a percentage of the value of eligible domestic inventory less certain reserves borrowings under the revolver bear interest in cash at an annual rate equal to at our option either libor or a “base rate” that was comprised of among other things the prime rate plus a margin that was between 10  and 375  depending on the currency borrowed and the specific term of repayment the revolver required us to pay a commitment fee between 025  and 0375  based on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment 

the revolver was secured by a pledge of substantially all our assets other than intellectual property and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including restricting our ability to make dividend payments and events of default in addition the revolver required us to maintain at least 150 million  of liquidity at all times of which at least 125 million  had to be undrawn availability as of december 31 2016  the company was in compliance with such covenants under the revolver 

as of december 31 2016  the amount outstanding under the revolver was 101 million  leaving an unused borrowing capacity of 129 million  the weightedaverage interest rate related to these borrowings was 53  

in february 2017 we amended our loan and security agreement with tcp to provide an additional 25 million in principal we simultaneously terminated our revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank na and the combined principal and interest balance of 103 million was fully repaid the new loan has the same july 1 2020 maturity date as the original tcp loan both of which are now interest only until february 2018 see notes 10 “debt” and 18 “subsequent event” for further information 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented in thousands 

  



  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

for 2016 net cash used in operating activities was 330 million primarily resulting from a net loss of 675 million the net loss was partially offset by noncash charges including stockbased compensation of 103 million depreciation and amortization of 106 million asset impairment and restructuring charges of 32 million and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of 31 million in addition the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities provided cash of 72 million

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  

  



   

as of december 31 2016  the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties was approximately 11 million since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 10 “debt” and note 14 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2016 we did not have any offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenue from sales of our microinverter systems which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway our cloudbased enlighten monitoring service and ac battery 

storage solutions to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners enlighten service revenue represented less than 2  of the total revenues for all periods presented 

  

revenue from sales of our products is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer iii the sale price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 

  

sales of an envoy communications gateway include the enlighten cloudbased monitoring service the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on our best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including internal costs gross margin and historical pricing practices after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using a best estimate of the selling price i revenue from the sale of envoy devices is recognized upon shipment assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met and ii revenue from the cloudbased monitoring service is recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices of 10  years 

  

inventory 

  

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market market is current replacement cost by purchase or by reproduction dependent on the type of inventory in cases where market exceeds net realizable value ie estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal inventories are stated at net realizable value market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin we determine cost on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory including customer demand and market conditions management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2016 2015 and 2014 were insignificant 

  

  

warranty obligations 

  

microinverters sold through december 31 2013 

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product’s warranty term  15 years  for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years  for third and fourth generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of its warranty liability this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used by us to estimate its warranty liability are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time ie failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time ie claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time ie replacement cost 

  

estimated failure rates— our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mtbf mean time between failure estimates for individual components contained in that generation of microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into operating environments we continue to monitor product performance via our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three  to nine  months between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three  to nine  months when a microinverter fails and is returned we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units 

prior to failure via enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 

estimated claim rates— warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 

estimated replacement costs— three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time between 15  and 25  years depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates may be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material 

  

fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1 2014 

  

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provide us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty under accounting standards codification “asc” 825—financial instruments “fair value option” an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years  

  

we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result the expected present value technique an income approach converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our creditadjusted riskfree rate see note 8 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update we adopted asu 201517 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented and had no impact on our results of operations 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu 201415 “presentation of financial statements—going concern” the update provides us gaap guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures for each reporting period management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued we adopted asu 201415 during the fourth quarter of 2016 see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” 

  

recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the updated standard’s core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard generally requires an entity to identify performance obligations in its contracts estimate the amount of variable consideration to be received in the transaction price allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and recognize revenue as obligations are satisfied in addition the updated standard requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts in 2015 the fasb issued guidance to defer the effective date to fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption for fiscal years beginning december 15 2016 the guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” which requires most entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value nrv this simplifies the evaluation from the current method of lower of cost or market where market is based on one of three measures ie replacement cost net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin asu 201511 does not apply to inventories measured under the lastin firstout method or the retail inventory method and defines nrv as the “estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation” asu 201511 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which amends certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments changes to the current guidance include the accounting for equity investments the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments and the assessment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to availableforsale securities in addition asu 201601 establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected under this guidance an entity would be required to separately present in other comprehensive income the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrumentspecific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings asu 201601 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 and upon adoption an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrumentspecific credit risk in other comprehensive income we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements   

in february 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards codification “asc” 842 “asc 842” “leases” which replaces the existing guidance in asc 840 leases asc 842 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 asc 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a rightofuse rou asset and a corresponding lease liability for finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the rou asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straightline total lease expense we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” which will simplify the income tax consequences accounting for forfeitures and classification on the statements of consolidated cash flows asu 201609 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” the provisions of this update simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the quantitative analysis for public entities this guidance is effective for years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted after january 1 2017 the adoption of this asu is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and we are planning on early adoption beginning with the 2017 goodwill impairment testing 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros british pounds and australian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european australian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

we have utilized foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to anticipated cash receipts from expected future revenues denominated in euros and intercompany transaction gains or losses the contracts we enter into typically have maturities of less than one year we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the foreign currency forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

the following table presents the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2016  and 2015  in thousands 



as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the aggregate gross notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts all with maturities of less than one year were 00  million and 24 million  respectively we recorded 01 million  and 03 million  of net gains in 2016  and 2015  respectively and 03 million  of net losses in 2014  related to foreign currency forward contracts 

the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our forward currency exchange contracts is limited as the exposure is substantially offset by exchange rate changes of the underlying hedged amounts

 item 1 business 

our company 

we deliver simple innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy  our semiconductorbased microinverter system converts direct current dc electricity to alternating current ac electricity at the individual solar module level and brings a systembased high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors networking and cloudbased software technologies our technology was designed to increase energy production simplify design and installation improve system uptime and reliability reduce fire safety risk and provide a platform for intelligent energy management we are the market leader in the microinverter category since inception we have shipped more than 103 million microinverters representing over 25 gigawatts of solar pv generating capacity and more than 430000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 100 countries   

we were incorporated as pvi solutions inc in march 2006 in the state of delaware and changed our name to enphase energy inc in july 2007 

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic or pv installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter as compared to microinverter systems we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar systems including the following 

 2 

is not performing to specification the resulting loss of energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time 

 these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

 our products 

we design develop manufacture and sell microinverter systems we have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductorbased microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies provides advanced energy monitoring and control this is vastly different than the central inverter approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array 

the enphase microinverter system brings a high technology networked approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors and cloudbased software technologies our unique approach to solar maximizes the potential energy production of each individual solar module while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities unlike our core competitors who utilize a singlepoint or traditional inverter we have builtin system redundancy eliminating the risk that comes with a singlepoint of failure further the nature of our cloudbased monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates enabling costeffective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance 

the enphase microinverter system consists of three key components enphase microinverters an envoy gateway and enlighten cloudbased software 

   

key elements of our solution include 

  

higher performance our microinverter system delivers higher performance by maximizing the energy production of each module a microinverter at each module overcomes issues such as modulemismatch and soiling or shading which can have a significant impact on string inverter systems enphase microinverters also provide greater system availability with no singlepoint of failure an independent analysis from pv evolution labs has concluded an enphase microinverter system yields higher performance over systems with string inverters or traditional inverters we believe that our microinverter systems achieve higher energy production and can generate superior returns on investment relative to competitive solutions for system owners 

  

simplified design and installation with our microinverter system an installer can design a system of any size and any roof configuration with a simple modular approach after initial installation the system can be easily expanded by even a single module the allac infrastructure simplifies the design process and eliminates the typical costs of a complicated dc voltage system in addition our microinverters are installed on the roof and hidden from view with minimal impact to the aesthetics of a home or building we also offer additional tools such as the enphase installer toolkit mobile app or the enphase ac combiner box to further improve installation time and reduce balance of system materials costs 

  

enhanced safety microinverters are safer because they process low voltage dc and are isolated to the module level leading to an allac architecture our microinverter system does not contain any of the high voltages common to string inverter systems high voltage arc faults associated with string or traditional inverters are the leading cause of fires of solar pv installations microinverter technology mitigates this safety risk 

reduced operations and maintenance costs our microinverter system is highly reliable with one million poweron hours of testing incorporated into our microinverter design this high reliability plus a distributed architecture means ongoing operations and maintenance do not require emergency truck rolls unlike string inverter or traditional inverters which have a 100 probability of failure leading to full replacement within 10 to 12 years thus reducing the inverter replacement budget required in addition with modulelevel monitoring capabilities remote maintenance can pinpoint issues thus reducing any time on site finally the networkednature of our system enables us to remotely update the firmware and software of the microinverters reducing ongoing utility compliance costs 

  

product roadmap 

  

our products are part of an integrated energy solution our product roadmap is divided into three categories that form the components and platform for our energy management solution microinverters energy storage and system monitoring and control 

  

microinverters our microinverter roadmap provides a path to substantially lower unit cost simplified installation process higher performance and enhanced features we have announced partnerships to integrate our next generation microinverter into a pv module to create an ac module that should further simplify system design and installation 

  

energy storage we are developing an energy storage system including our ac battery that will integrate with our microinverter system to provide the enphase energy solution our energy storage system uses modular allac architecture 

  

system monitoring and control our cloudbased monitoring gathers more than 2tb of data per day from more than 345000 actively monitored systems the introduction of consumption monitoring provides additional opportunities to give system owners further control over and insight into their systems furthermore the rich data available from the systems has enabled the growth of our solar operations and maintenance services through enphase energy services 

  

our strategy 

our objective is to be the leading provider of energy management solutions for the solar industry worldwide key elements of our strategy include 

 4 

 customers and sales 

we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets  we sell our microinverter systems primarily to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators who in turn integrate our products into complete solar pv installations for residential and commercial system owners we work with many of the leading solar and electrical distributors in addition to our distributors we sell directly to large installers oems and strategic partners our oem customers include solar module manufacturers who bundle our products and solutions with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers strategic partners include a variety of companies including industrial equipment suppliers and providers of solar financing solutions in 2015 ced greentech and vivint solar inc accounted for 17 and 12 of net revenues respectively   historically revenues generated from the us market have represented more than 80 of our total revenue   

manufacturing quality control and key suppliers 

we outsource the manufacturing of our products to two key manufacturing partners flextronics international ltd and phoenix contact gmbh  co kg flextronics assembles and tests our microinverter and envoy products prices for such services are mutually agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the agreement flextronics also provides receiving kitting storage transportation inventory visibility and other valueadded logistics services at locations managed by flextronics phoenix manufactures our custom ac cable in addition we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our microinverter system 

customer service 

we maintain high levels of customer engagement through our customer support group and the enlighten cloudbased software portal and have cultivated an organizational focus on customer satisfaction our dedicated customer support group focuses on responding to inbound inquiries regarding any of our products and services as of december 31 2015  our customer support staff consisted of 59 employees in the united states 10 employees in europe and 5 employees in australia 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and optimize the effectiveness of our energy management solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development against metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and easeofuse as of december 31 2015  our research and development staff consisted of 229 employees of whom 195 were located in the united states and the remainder primarily located in new zealand 

our research and development expenses were 508 million  454 million  and 345 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2015  we had 69 issued us patents 74 issued foreign patents 90 pending us patent applications and 126 pending foreign counterpart patent applications  our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2027 and 2032 

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our asics pursuant to a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any third party manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market the license carries a seventyfive year term subject to earlier termination upon mutual agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices or cplds and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

with respect to among other things proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

  

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

  

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our microinverter technology or business plans 

seasonality 

historically sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters have been positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles followed by a seasonally softer first quarter  although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we compete with traditional inverter manufacturers and new technology startups the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

 6 

 competitors in the inverter market are amongst others sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh abb ltd and solaredge technologies inc and other emerging companies offering alternative microinverter dc to dc optimizer and other power electronic solutions  we principally compete with the large incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to our microinverter solution we believe however that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central or string inverter technology even when traditional central or string inverter technology is supplemented by dctodc optimizers 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2015  we had 543  employees of the fulltime employees 229 were engaged in research and development 181 in sales and marketing 53 in a general and administrative capacity and 80 in manufacturing and operations of these employees 463 were in the united states 32 in both europe and new zealand 14 in australia and two employees in canada 

  

none of our us new zealand uk and australia employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france and italy are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

we have a history of losses which may continue in the future and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability   

we have incurred significant net losses since we began doing business including net losses of 221 million  81 million  and 259 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as of december 31 2015  we had an accumulated deficit of 1831 million  we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and we may continue to incur additional losses in the future our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our offerings increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

our relatively short operating history in a rapidly changing industry makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 

while we have been in existence since 2006 and began shipping our products in commercial quantities until mid2008 much of our growth has occurred in recent periods our relatively short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer 

our microinverter systems are utilized in solar photovoltaic or pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years   and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to continue to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 

 8 

 if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our customers products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology have recently caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of asian manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the loss of or events affecting one of our major customers could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2015 ced greentech and vivint solar inc accounted for 17 and 12 of net revenues respectively  in 2014 vivint solar inc and ced greentech accounted for 24 and 16 of total net revenues respectively in 2013 vivint solar inc ced greentech and focused energy inc accounted for 15 14 and 11 of total net revenues respectively our customers’ decisions to purchase our products are influenced by a number of factors outside of our control including retail energy prices and government regulation and incentives among others although we have agreements with some of our largest customers these agreements generally do not have longterm purchase commitments and are generally terminable by either party after a relatively short notice period in addition these customers may decide to no longer use or to reduce the use of our products and services for other reasons which may be out of our control for example vivint solar inc is pursuing a multisourcing strategy and therefore is not solesourcing our microinverters which has resulted and may continue to result in a reduction in our revenue generated from sales to vivint the loss of or events affecting vivint or one or more of our other large customers have had could have and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 9 

 fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

we are under continuous pressure to reduce the prices of our products which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our gross margins 

the solar power industry has been characterized by declining product prices over time we have reduced the prices of many of our products in the past and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure for our products in the future including from our major customers when seeking to maintain or increase their market share our competitors may also reduce the prices of their products in addition our customers may have the ability or seek to internally develop and manufacture competing products at a lower cost than we would otherwise charge which would add additional pressure on us to lower our selling prices if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our gross margin would be adversely affected 

given the general downward pressure on prices for our products driven by competitive pressure and technological change a principal component of our business strategy is reducing our costs to manufacture our products to remain competitive if our competitors are able to drive down their manufacturing costs faster than we can or increase the efficiency of their products our products may become less competitive even when adjusted for efficiency further if raw materials costs and other thirdparty component costs were to increase we may not meet our cost reduction targets if we cannot effectively execute our cost reduction roadmap our competitive position will suffer and we could lose market share and our margins would be adversely affected as we face downward pricing pressure 

the inverter industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce products which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share 

the market for pv inverter solutions is highly competitive to date we have competed primarily against central and string inverter manufacturers but as the solar industry rapidly grows new solutions and technologies are emerging that will directly compete with our business competitors in the inverter market are amongst others sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh abb ltd and solaredge technologies inc and other emerging companies offering alternative microinverter dc to dc optimizer and other power electronic solutions 

competition has intensified and we expect the trend to continue as new and existing competitors enter the microinverter market or market and sell related products such as dc to dc optimizers that can be used in conjunction with central or string inverters sma solar technology ag and abb ltd market and sell microinverter products and several new entrants to the microinverter market have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products we believe that a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our microinverter systems in the modulelevel power electronics or mlpe market including lowcost asian manufacturers in addition central and string inverter manufacturers continue to drive down their prices putting additional pressure on us and other alternative technologies 

several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger and more established than we are and may have greater financial marketing distribution and customer support resources and may have significantly broader brand recognition especially in certain markets in addition some of our competitors have more resources and experience to develop or acquire new products and technologies and create market awareness for these offerings further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our microinverter systems in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

we also may face competition from some of our customers or potential customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally for instance sunpower corporation acquired a microinverter company solarbridge technologies inc in november of 2014 other solar module manufacturers could also develop or acquire competing inverter technology or attempt to develop components that directly perform dc to ac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they 

may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers or potential customers may purchase fewer of our microinverter systems or sell products that compete with our microinverters systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

developments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings 

significant developments in alternative technologies such as advances in other forms of distributed solar pv power generation storage solutions such as batteries the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes or to react to changes in existing technologies could result in product obsolescence the loss of competitiveness of our products decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors 

our microinverter systems may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share 

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 

 in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central or string inverters these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central or string inverter systems which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our microinverter systems 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business 

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers’ sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries most notably australia canada france belgium germany italy japan the people’s republic of china the united kingdom spain and the united states have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs or fits rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over 

time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being changed by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions that we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place additionally electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the modification elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications 

to date we have generated the majority of our revenues from north america and expect to continue to generate a substantial amount of our revenues from north america in the future there are a number of important incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products a substantial majority of our revenues come from the united states which has both federal and state incentives for instance the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 was recently extended as part of an omnibus appropriations bill and provides a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019 and reduced tax credits of 26 and 22 through december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively before being reduced to 10 for commercial installations and 0 for residential installations beginning in 2022 

in addition net energy metering tariffs are being evaluated and in some instances modified which may have a negative impact on future inverter sales we derive a significant portion of our revenues from california’s residential solar market and the existing california net energy metering tariff has been very successful in incentivizing the installation of residential solar systems california however is reevaluating existing incentives tariffs and rates for residential systems in order to accommodate a sustainable growth trajectory for residential solar and to also encourage the adoption of other distributed energy resources such as energy storage that provide additional benefits to the consumer and the electricity grid there is a risk that future regulatory changes do not adequately stimulate future growth in the residential solar market we also sell our products in europe a number of european countries including germany belgium spain italy and the united kingdom have adopted reductions or concluded their fit programs certain countries notably greece and spain have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe 

we also sell our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a national price on carbon emissions intended to increase the cost of traditional energy sources thereby making renewable energy sources more attractive beginning in 2012 several states in australia began to gradually reduce their fits in 2013 australia elected a new national government the new leadership pledged to revise national energy policy including potentially reducing australia’s renewable energy target and revising certain renewable energy financing mechanisms in july 2014 the new leadership successfully repealed the tax on carbon emissions 

we also sell our products in ontario canada the government of ontario has the authority to change the fits for future contracts at its discretion and has the authority to modify suspend or discontinue the program at any time suspension of the fit program in ontario directly impacted and could continue to impact our business furthermore any future suspension or modification of the program could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe the federal and state tax credits applicable federal and state grants applicable tariffs and other incentive programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception however unless these programs are further extended or modified to allow for continued growth in the residential solar market the phaseout of such programs could adversely affect sales of our products in the future the reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy including local content requirements have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business domestically and abroad additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example the italian energy authority aeeg enacted a new set of interconnection standards for solar energy installations that became effective in july 2012 which has negatively impacted our sales in italy we continue to explore potential solutions to meet these requirements however in the event that we cannot implement a solution in the near term the total market available for our microinverter products in italy and our business as a result may continue to be adversely impacted 

in addition several states or territories including california hawaii and queensland australia have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rules regulating the installation of solar systems that we may not be able to currently comply with in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations that would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks for our business 

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including the sovereign debt issues in europe pose risks for our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have reduced demand for solar products the european sovereign debt crisis has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales in europe 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe that a system owner’s decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and lowering sales of our microinverter systems in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar components industry including manufacturers of central inverters and dc to dc optimizers could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products 

additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to make installation or operation of solar distributed generation more costly such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our microinverter systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to continue to incur additional warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue and gross profit to decline 

we have offered 15year limited warranties for our first and second generation microinverters and offer a limited warranty of up to 25 years on our third and fourth generation microinverters our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our microinverters under normal use and service conditions for up to 25 years following installation as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized revenue our estimated costs of warranty for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty 

while we offer warranties of up to 25 years our microinverters have only been in use since mid2008 when we first commenced commercial sales of our products although we conduct accelerated life cycle testing to measure performance and reliability our microinverter systems have not been tested over the full warranty cycle and do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life in addition under realworld operating conditions which may vary by location and design as well as insolation soiling and weather conditions a typical solar pv installation may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions if our products perform below expectations or have unexpected reliability problems we may be unable to gain or retain customers and could face substantial warranty expense 

we are required to make assumptions and apply judgments based on our accelerated life cycle testing and the limited operating history of our products regarding a number of factors including the durability and reliability of our products our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the costs of replacement of defective products our assumptions have proven and could in the future prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our products which has caused and may in the future cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products increases in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to actual product failure rates field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting product failures have caused and could in the future cause us to materially increase the amount of warranty obligations and have had and may have in the future a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations 

we also depend significantly on our reputation for reliability and highquality products and services exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business if our products and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired and we may lose or be unable to gain or retain customers 

defects and poor performance in our products could result in loss of customers decreased revenue and unexpected expenses and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

our products must meet stringent quality requirements and may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product these errors or defects may be dangerous as defective power components may cause power overloads potentially resulting in explosion or fire as we develop new generations of our products and enter new markets we face higher risk of undetected defects because our testing protocols may not be able to fully test the products under all possible operating conditions in the past we have experienced defects in our products due to certain errors in the manufacturing and design process any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts in order to address or remedy any defects and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

furthermore defective inefficient or poorly performing power components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event 

of a claim also we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain this coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty and product liability claims or product recalls may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems based on our product platform may contain undetected errors failures or bugs especially when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our monitoring service could harm our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses 

if we are unable to effectively manage our growth our business and operating results may suffer 

we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience significant growth in our sales and operations our historical growth has placed and planned future growth is expected to continue to place significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources to 

 we cannot assure you that our current and planned operations personnel systems internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation business or prospects 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents available credit facilities and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 

 we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations expand our research and development sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events including unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 

our recent and planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks 

we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets  we also intend to expand into other international markets and to introduce new microinverter systems targeted at larger commercial and utilityscale installations our success in these new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 

 further new geographic markets and the larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

 failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these products to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our 

distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and cost efficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

ordering patterns from our distributors may cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period 

our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their assessment of endcustomer demand and their forecasts because these forecasts may not be accurate channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly due to the difference between their forecasts and actual demand as a result distributors adjust their purchase orders placed with us in response to changing channel inventory levels as well as their assessment of the latest market demand trends we have limited visibility into future end customer demand a significant decrease in our distributors’ channel inventory in one period may lead to a significant rebuilding of channel inventory in subsequent periods or vice versa which may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly this fluctuation may cause our results to fall short of analyst or investor expectations in a certain period which may cause our stock price to decline 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers 

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products in particular we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of microinverter products cabling and our communications gateway related to our microinverter systems our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our other manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which the vast majority of our microinverters related cabling and communications gateway products are manufactured are located outside of the united states we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the united states increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our relationships with our distributors and end customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in our manufacturing partner’s fabrication facility due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes or those of some thirdparty contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of production lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension of manufacturing production lines could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components of our products for example our asics are purchased from a sole source supplier or developed for us by sole source suppliers similarly the battery cells for our ac battery product will also initially be sole sourced any of the sole source and limited source suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues could stop producing our components cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes may currently be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms including price or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of sole source or limited source components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business 

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter 

into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if potential owners of solar pv systems based on our product platform are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms we could experience a reduction in the demand for our solar pv systems 

many owners of solar pv systems depend on financing to purchase their systems the limited use of microinverters to date coupled with our limited operating history could result in lenders refusing to provide the financing necessary to purchase solar pv systems based on our product platform on favorable terms or at all moreover in the case of debt financed projects even if lenders are willing to finance the purchase of these systems an increase in interest rates or a change in tax incentives could make it difficult for owners to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all in addition we believe that a significant percentage of owners purchase solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of upfront cash and financing difficulties in obtaining financing for solar pv systems on favorable terms or increases in interest rates or changes in tax incentives could lower an investor’s return on investment in a solar pv system or make alternative solar pv systems or other investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems based on our product platform any of these events could result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition an increasing share of residential solar installations has been provided through third party financing structures such as power purchase or lease agreements our sales growth therefore increasingly depends on sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings who provide solar as a service via power purchase agreements or leasing structures the third party finance market for residential solar in the united states and elsewhere is or may become highly concentrated with a few significant finance companies and several smaller entrants if we are unable develop relationships and gain a significant share of inverter sales to the major finance companies or new entrants our overall sales growth will be constrained 

we rely primarily on distributors large installers and providers of solar financing to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties and as a result many of our customers also use or market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may generally terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by these customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

we may fail to capture customers in the new product and geographic markets that we are pursuing 

we are pursuing opportunities in energy management and energy storage which are highly competitive markets we have made investments in our infrastructure increased our operating costs and forgone other business opportunities in order to seek opportunities in these areas and will continue to do so any new product is subject to certain risks including component sourcing strategic partner selection and execution customer acceptance competition product differentiation market timing challenges relating to economies of scale in component sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow if we fail to execute on our plan with respect to new product introductions these new potential business segments fail to translate into revenue in the quantities or timeline 

projected thus having a materially adverse impact on our revenue operating results and financial stability in addition we are pursuing new geographic markets the inability to capture new customers in the highgrowth geographic markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success in an “ac module” version of our microinverter system may depend in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers 

we are currently working on variants of our microinverter system that will enable an “ac module” for direct attachment of the microinverter to the solar modules the market success of such solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with solar module manufacturers to design solar modules that are compatible with such direct attachment of our microinverter we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions combining our microinverter system and solar modules for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial changes faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled technical people is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business if we fail to retain our senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business could suffer 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the united states and in certain other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the united states we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade secrets in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may 

not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert management’s attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate 

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against certain of our competitors from time to time we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert management’s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the united states and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties’ patent rights or that we were the first to conceive or protect inventions covered by our patents or patent applications as we become more visible as a publicly traded company the possibility that third parties may make claims of intellectual property infringement or other violations against us may grow an adverse outcome with respect to any such claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

 any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

from time to time we have licensed and in the future we may choose to or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products we cannot assure that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with applicable open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code any of the foregoing could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles 

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months such as northern europe canada and the united states in general we expect our products in the second third and fourth quarters will be positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles preceded by a seasonally softer first quarter in 

the united states customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future 

covenants in our credit facility may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

we are a party to a loan and security agreement with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” the loan and security agreement with wells fargo restricts our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt encumbering our tangible or intangible property paying dividends or engaging in certain transactions such as mergers and acquisitions investments and asset sales our loan and security agreement with wells fargo also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including liquidity ratios these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under our loan and security agreement with wells fargo is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding intellectual property which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness and the forfeiture of our assets subject to security interests in favor of the lenders 

we are an “emerging growth company” and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which could make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act enacted in april 2012 or the jobs act and for as long as we continue to be an “emerging growth company” we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we could be an “emerging growth company” until december 31 2017 the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering although we could cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier if certain events occur as specified in the jobs act such as our achieving annual revenue of at least 1 billion or our becoming a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule 12b2 of the exchange act we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act has required and will continue to require significant attention of management although we are currently not required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting otherwise required by section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act this exemption will no longer be available to us beginning with our first annual report on 10k for the year in which we cease to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in the future the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price in addition a delay in compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions including sec action ineligibility for short form resale registration the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the stock exchange on which it is listed and the inability of registered brokerdealers to make a market in our common stock which would further reduce our stock price 

and could harm our business to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our ability to use net operating losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the internal revenue code and may be subject to further limitation as a result of future transactions 

sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a more than 50 percentage point increase in the percentage of its stock owned by certain stockholders over a threeyear period to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in the years after the ownership change these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders who directly or indirectly own 5 or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company generally if an ownership change occurs the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change if these limitations apply we may be unable to offset our taxable income with net operating losses or our tax liability with credits before these losses and credits expire we recently completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation under the code however we do not anticipate these limitations will significantly impact our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 

in addition it is possible that future transactions including issuances of new shares of our common stock and sales of shares of our common stock will cause us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes in that event we generally would not be able to use our net operating losses from periods prior to this ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by sections 382 and 383 and those attributes that are already subject to limitations as a result of our prior ownership changes may be subject to more stringent limitations 

natural disasters terrorist or cyber attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in petaluma california is located near major earthquake fault lines further a terrorist attack including one aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our cloudbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products in the event that an earthquake tsunami typhoon terrorist or cyber attack or other natural manmade or technical catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

any unauthorized access to or disclosure or theft of personal information we gather store or use could harm our reputation and subject us to claims or litigation 

we receive store and use certain personal information of our customers and the endusers of our customers’ solar pv systems including names addresses email addresses credit information and energy production statistics we also store and use personal information of our employees we take steps to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the personal information we collect store and transmit but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we and our suppliers or vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigation measures 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee or contractor error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information were to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such 

information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business a disruption infiltration or failure of our information technology systems as a result of software or hardware malfunctions system implementations or upgrades computer viruses cyber attacks thirdparty security breaches employee error theft or misuse malfeasance power disruptions natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner customer and employee personal data we have been and may in the future be subject to fraud attempts from outside parties through our electronic systems such as “phishing” email communications to our finance technical or other personnel which could put us at risk for harm from fraud theft or other loss if our internal controls do not operate as intended any of these events could harm our competitive position result in a loss of customer confidence cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are dependent on ocean transportation to deliver our products in a cost efficient manner if we are unable to use ocean transportation to deliver our products our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

we rely on commercial ocean transportation for the delivery of a large percentage of our products to our customers in north america we also rely on more expensive air transportation when ocean transportation is not available or compatible with the delivery time requirements of our customers our ability to deliver our products via ocean transportation could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling pricing payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel taxes and labor and other factors such as labor strikes and work stoppages not within our control if we are unable to use ocean transportation and are required to substitute more expensive air transportation our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation whether caused by strike work stoppage lockout slowdown or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter this variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations these fluctuations are due to numerous factors including 

 24 

 the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our other stockholders may not view as beneficial 

our affiliated stockholders executive officers and directors collectively own a significant percentage of our common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock all outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition the terms of our revolving credit facility restrict our ability to pay dividends consequently an investor’s only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as “may” “will” “should” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “predict” “intend” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology for example statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance expense levels and liquidity sources are forwardlooking statements our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

we deliver simple innovative and reliable energy management solutions that advance the worldwide potential of renewable energy  we were founded in march 2006 and have grown rapidly to become the market leader in the microinverter category our technology was designed to increase energy production simplify design and installation improve system uptime and reliability reduce fire safety risk and provide a platform for intelligent energy management since inception we have shipped more than 103 million microinverters representing over 25 gigawatts of solar pv generating capacity and more than 430000 enphase residential and commercial systems have been deployed in over 100 countries 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers “oems” and strategic partners historically revenues generated from the us market have represented more than 80 of our total revenue   

we have experienced revenue growth since our first commercial shipment in mid2008 our net revenues were  3572 million  3439 million  and 2328 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively which reflects deeper market penetration and broader acceptance of microinverter technology we incurred net losses of 221 million  81 million  and 259 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as we continued to invest substantial resources to support the growth of our business including enhancing our research and development operations to drive product cost reductions as well as developing technological innovations and new products marketing and selling our products and expanding into new product markets and geographies at december 31 2015 we had 543  employees 

components of consolidated statements of operations 

net revenues 

we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems which include microinverter units an envoy communications gateway and our enlighten cloudbased monitoring service we sell to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners 

our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems driven by supply and demand sales incentives and competitive product offerings our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace by developing and introducing new products to meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers the diversification and expansion of our revenue base and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs warranty manufacturing personnel and logistics costs freight costs depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs our product costs are impacted by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation certain costs primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the growing demand for our products for the foreseeable future however shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products 

in addition third parties including one of our contract manufacturers serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in the united states europe and asia 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product cost product mix warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes recruiting costs sales commissions incentive compensation and stockbased compensation 

research and development expense includes personnelrelated expenses such as salaries incentive compensation stockbased compensation and employee benefits research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors powerline communications networking and software functionality and storage research and development expense also includes thirdparty design and development costs testing and evaluation costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources to research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs improve functionality and enhance reliability we intend to continue to invest substantial resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position 

sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnelrelated expenses such as salaries commissions incentive compensation stockbased compensation employee benefits and travel it also includes trade shows marketing customer support and other indirect costs we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors large installers oems and strategic partners we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada mexico and certain central american markets the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets australia new zealand and certain other asian markets  we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future 

  

general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries incentive compensation stockbased compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services professional services consist primarily of outside legal accounting and information technology consulting costs 

other expense net 

other expense net includes interest expense and commitment fees under our revolving credit facility term loans and noncash interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs as well as gains or losses upon conversion of nonus dollar transactions into us dollars and from foreign currency forward contracts 

provision for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products historically we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly due to the history of losses we have generated in the united states since inception we believe that it is morelikelythannot that all of our us and state deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31 2015  

summary consolidated statements of operations 

  

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented in thousands 

  



comparison of 2015  2014  and 2013   

  

net revenues 

  



  

2015 compared to 2014   net revenues increased by 4  to 3572 million  in 2015 as compared to 2014 the number of microinverter units sold increased by 19 from 26 million units in 2014 to 31 million units in 2015 net revenues grew yearoveryear at a slower pace than units sold due to a decline in the average selling price average selling prices per watt for microinverters shipped declined approximately 15 in 2015 compared to 2014 

  

2014 compared to 2013   net revenues increased by 48  to 3439 million  in 2014 as compared to 2013 the number of microinverter units sold increased by 59 from 16 million units in 2013 to 26 million units in 2014 revenues grew yearover year at a slightly slower pace than units shipped due to a decline in the average selling price which was consistent with trends in the solar industry average selling prices per watt for microinverters shipped declined by approximately 9 in 2014 compared to 2013 

  

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  



  

2015 compared to 2014   cost of revenues increased by 8  in 2015 as compared to 2014 and was attributable to the greater volume of shipments of our products gross margin decreased by 26 percentage points to 303  in 2015 as compared to 329  in 2014 while we experienced a reduction in our product costs the adoption of a more aggressive pricing strategy resulted in a decrease to our gross margin in 2015 our gross margin included the benefit of lower warranty expense as compared to 2014 which positively impacted gross margin by 25 percentage points the higher warranty expense in 2014 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates which reduced gross margin by 24 percentage points in 2015 changes in estimates related to warranty expense did not impact gross margin see note 7 “warranty obligations” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

2014 compared to 2013  cost of revenues increased by 40  in 2014 as compared to 2013 and was attributable to the greater volume of shipments of our products gross margin increased by 39 percentage points to 329 in 2014 as compared to 290 in 2013 contributing to the increase was a larger proportion of sales from our highermargin fourth generation microinverters sold in 2014 as compared to 2013 also contributing to the increase in gross margin was lower warranty expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 in 2014 our gross margin included the benefit of lower warranty expense as compared to 2013 which positively impacted gross margin by 2 percentage points the higher warranty expense in 2013 was primarily due to incremental provisions recorded for changes in estimates which reduced gross margin by 44 percentage points in 2014 changes in estimates related to warranty expense reduced gross margin by 24 percentage points in addition our election to measure warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value improved gross margin by 15 percentage points see note 7 “warranty obligations” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

research and development 

  



  

2015 compared to 2014   research and development expenses increased by 54 million  in 2015 as compared to 2014 this increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development headcount which resulted in increased expense of 39 million from salaries and stockbased compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs in addition there was an increase in outside contract services of 10 million to support the development of new products as well as enhancements and cost reductions to existing products the remaining increase of 05 million was attributed to higher depreciation and amortization related to research and development equipment the amount of research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the differing levels and stages of development activity 

  

2014 compared to 2013  research and development expenses increased by 109 million  in 2014 as compared to 2013 this increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development headcount which resulted in increased expense of 72 million from salaries incentive compensation and stockbased compensation in addition there was an increase in outside contract services of 30 million to support the development of our next generation microinverter system the remaining increase of 05 million was attributed to higher depreciation and amortization related to research and development equipment 

sales and marketing 

  



  

2015 compared to 2014   sales and marketing expenses increased by 49 million  in 2015 as compared to 2014 this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount during the first nine months of 2015 which resulted in increased expense of 40 million from salaries and stockbased compensation partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs other increases include a 13 million increase in bad debt expense 07 million in marketing and consulting expenses and a 07 million increase in facilities related costs these increases were partially offset by a 18 million benefit related to a revaluation of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration liability 

  

2014 compared to 2013  sales and marketing expenses increased by 99 million  in 2014 as compared to 2013 this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount which resulted in increased expense of 91 million from salaries incentive compensation and stockbased compensation in addition increased marketing activities mostly from trade shows and use of outside consultants contributed 13 million to the increase the increase was partially offset by 05 million in bad debt recoveries 

  

general and administrative 

  



  

2015 compared to 2014   general and administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 personnelrelated costs decreased 25 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 this decrease was offset by a 14 million increase related to corporatelevel expenses including rent utilities and depreciation related to corporate fixed assets a 05 million increase in recruiting costs and a 03 million increase in professional services costs 

  

2014 compared to 2013  general and administrative expenses increased by 71 million  in 2014 as compared to 2013 this increase was primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 46 million related to modest headcount growth and increases in incentive and stockbased compensation for existing employees in addition an increase in the use of outside consultants including advisory services for our secondary offering and acquisition contributed 16 million to the increase the remaining increase was attributable to facilitiesrelated costs information technology costs and other general corporate expenses 

other income expense net 

  



  

2015 compared to 2014   other expense decreased 15 million  in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of lower interest paid due to the full repayment of our term loan with hercules technology growth capital inc in december 2014 

  

2014 compared to 2013  other expense remained flat at 29 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively and primarily consisted of interest expense and foreign currency transaction losses in december 2014 we recorded 03 million of interest expense related to the writeoff of deferred financing costs and the unaccrued portion of the end of term fee in connection with the voluntary prepayment of our term loan 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources of liquidity 

  

as of december 31 2015  we had 285 million  in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 489 million  cash and cash equivalents held in the united states were 234 million and consisted primarily of noninterest bearing checking deposits with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries 

we maintain a 500 million  revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank na “wells fargo” that was entered into on november 7 2012 as first amended on february 14 2014 on december 18 2015 we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with wells fargo the “revolver” which extended the maturity date from november 7 2016 to november 7 2019 and added an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility by 250 million  subject to certain approvals and meeting certain criteria 

availability under the revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation that limits availability to a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus a percentage of the value of eligible domestic inventory less certain reserves borrowings under the revolver bear interest in cash at an annual rate equal to at our option either libor or a “base rate” that is comprised of among other things the prime rate plus a margin that is between 10  and 375  depending on the currency borrowed and the specific term of repayment the revolver requires us to pay a commitment fee between 025  and 0375  based on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit commitment 

the revolver is secured by a pledge of substantially all our assets other than intellectual property and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including restricting our ability to make dividend payments and events of default in addition the revolver requires us to maintain at least 150 million  of liquidity at all times of which at least 50 million  must be undrawn availability as of december 31 2015 the company was in compliance with such covenants under the revolver 

as of december 31 2015 the amount outstanding under the revolver was 170 million  leaving an unused borrowing capacity of 277 million  the weightedaverage interest rate related to these borrowings was 43  

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents of 285 million as of december 31 2015  together with borrowings expected to be available under our revolver will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital asset purchases service our indebtedness outstanding commitments and obligations and fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to meet our projected performance targets our liquidity could be adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of liquidity if additional sources of liquidity are needed we may consider new debt or equity offerings but there is no assurance that such transactions could be consummated on acceptable terms or at all failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented in thousands 

  



  

cash flows from operating activities 

  

for 2015 net cash used in operating activities was 212 million  primarily resulting from a net loss of 221 million  the net loss was partially offset by noncash charges including stockbased compensation of 127 million  depreciation and amortization of 105 million  and net adjustments of 10 million for other noncash items in addition the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities resulted in the use of cash totaling 233 million 

the primary use of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities was attributable to a 192 million increase in inventory the increase in inventory was attributed to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 other uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities included a 53 million increase in 

other assets primarily attributable to an increase in customer financing receivables and the corresponding deferred costs of revenues 34 million decrease in warranty obligations 26 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued other liabilities due to timing of payments and a decrease in incentive compensation accrual and 25 million increase in accounts receivable offsetting these uses of cash was an increase in deferred revenue of 97 million related to our enlighten service as well as deferred product revenue corresponding with the increase in customer financing receivables 

for 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 242 million our net loss of 81 million was more than offset by noncash charges and net changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash charges included 97 million of stockbased compensation 83 million of depreciation and amortization and 14 million of other noncash charges in addition cash provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities was 128 million 

for 2013 net cash used in operating activities was 09 million our net loss of 259 million was substantially offset by noncash charges and net changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash items included 70 million of depreciation and amortization 69 million of stockbased compensation a provision for doubtful accounts of 07 million and 04 million of noncash interest expense in addition cash provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities was 100 million 

cash flows from investing activities 

  

for 2015 net cash used in investing activities of 125 million  included 102 million for purchases of test and assembly equipment and 23 million of capitalized internaluse software costs in addition we licensed certain technology related to asic development for a threeyear term pursuant to the agreement we paid 02 million in 2015 with the remaining 07 million payable in 2016 

for 2014 net cash used in investing activities of 165 million  included purchases of test and assembly equipment and capitalized internaluse software costs in addition we acquired substantially all of the assets of next phase solar inc “nps” for an initial cash consideration of 25 million which included 03 million being held back to cover indemnification obligations of the selling party and recorded as restricted cash in a separate transaction we purchased certain patents related to system interconnection and photovoltaic ac module construction for 08 million 

  

for 2013 net cash used in investing activities of 63 million  included purchases of test and assembly equipment and capitalized internaluse software costs 

cash flows from financing activities 

  

for 2015 net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of 170 million from net borrowings made under our revolver to fund our working capital needs 40 million received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans 02 million in financing costs associated with the amended and restated revolving credit facility 

for 2014 net cash used in financing activities consisted of 87 million related to repayment of all outstanding principal under our term loan and equipment financing facility offset by 54 million received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans 

  

for 2013 net cash used by financing activities was insignificant cash received from common stock issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans was 24 million these inflows of cash were offset by principal repayments of term loans of 24 million 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  

  



   

as of december 31 2015  the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties was approximately 09 million since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 12 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2015 we did not have any offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenue from sales of our microinverter systems which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway and an enlighten cloudbased monitoring service to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners enlighten service revenue represented less than 2  of the total revenues for all periods presented 

  

revenues from sales of microinverters and related accessories and communication gateways are recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of 

the sales agreement and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer iii the sale price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 

  

sales of an envoy communications gateway include the enlighten cloudbased monitoring service the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on our best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including internal costs gross margin and historical pricing practices after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using a best estimate of the selling price i revenue from the sale of envoy devices is recognized upon shipment assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met and ii revenue from the cloudbased monitoring service is recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices of 10  years 

  

inventory 

  

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market market is current replacement cost by purchase or by reproduction dependent on the type of inventory in cases where market exceeds net realizable value ie estimated selling price less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal inventories are stated at net realizable value market is not considered to be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin we determine cost on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of its inventory including customer demand and market conditions management assesses the valuation on a quarterly basis and writes down the value for any excess and obsolete inventory based upon expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and market the impact of changes in the inventory valuation allowance for 2015 2014 and 2013 were insignificant 

  

business combinations 

  

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date we use judgment to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration a component of the purchase consideration identify all the tangible and intangible assets acquired estimate the fair value of these assets estimate the useful life of the assets and assess the appropriate method for recognizing depreciation or amortization expense over the asset’s useful life we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets the future amount of amortization and depreciation expense that will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and the amount of goodwill which will be subject to impairment testing performed in subsequent periods critical estimates in valuing contingent consideration include but are not limited to probabilities applied to multiple payout scenarios and a riskadjusted discount rate critical estimates in valuing intangible assets ie customer relationships include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and customer attrition rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

  

warranty obligations 

  

microinverters sold through december 31 2013 

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product’s warranty term  15 years  for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years  for third and fourth generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of its warranty liability this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty liability are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used by us to estimate its warranty liability are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time ie failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time ie claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time ie replacement cost 

  

estimated failure rates— our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mtbf mean time between failure estimates for individual components contained in its microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and 

accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into operating environments we continue to monitor product performance via our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three  to nine  months between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three  to nine  months when a microinverter fails and is returned we performs diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure via enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 

estimated claim rates— warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected by changes over time in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 

estimated replacement costs— three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time between 15  and 25  years depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates would be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material 

  

fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1 2014 

  

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provide us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty under accounting standards codification “asc” 825—financial instruments “fair value option” an entity may choose to elect the fair value option for such warranties at the time it first recognizes the eligible item we made an irrevocable election to account for all eligible warranty obligations associated with microinverters sold since january 1 2014 at fair value this election was made to reflect the underlying economics of the time value of money for an obligation that will be settled over an extended period of up to 25 years  

  

we estimate the fair value of warranty obligations by calculating the warranty obligations in the same manner as for sales prior to january 1 2014 and applying an expected present value technique to that result the expected present value technique an income approach converts future amounts into a single current discounted amount in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs we used certain inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions included compensation comprised of a profit element and risk premium required of a market participant to assume the obligation and a discount rate based on our creditadjusted riskfree rate see note 8 “fair value measurements” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update we adopted asu 201517 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented and had no impact on our results of operations 

  

recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 topic 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap the updated standard’s core principle is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard generally requires an entity to identify performance obligations in its contracts estimate the amount of variable consideration to be received in the transaction price allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and recognize revenue as obligations are satisfied in addition the updated standard requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts in 2015 the fasb issued guidance to defer the effective date to fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption for fiscal years beginning december 15 2016 the guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu 201415 “presentation of financial statements—going concern” the update provides us gaap guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures for each reporting period management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued the amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after december 15 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” which requires most entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value nrv this simplifies the evaluation from the current method of lower of cost or market where market is based on one of three measures ie replacement cost net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin asu 201511 does not apply to inventories measured under the lastin firstout method or the retail inventory method and defines nrv as the “estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation” asu 201511 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which amends certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments changes to the current guidance include the accounting for equity investments the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments and the assessment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to availableforsale securities in addition asu 201601 establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected under this guidance an entity would be required to separately present in other comprehensive income the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrumentspecific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings asu 201601 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 and upon adoption an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrumentspecific credit risk in other comprehensive income we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements   

in february 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards codification “asc” 842 “asc 842” “leases” which replaces the existing guidance in asc 840 leases asc 842 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 asc 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a rightofuse rou asset and a corresponding lease liability for finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the rou asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straightline total lease expense we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros british pounds and australian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european australian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to anticipated cash receipts from expected future revenues denominated in euros and intercompany transaction gains or losses the contracts we enter into typically have maturities of less than one year we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the foreign currency forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

the following table presents the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2015  and 2014  in thousands 



as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the aggregate gross notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts all with maturities of less than one year were 24 million  and 15 million  respectively we recorded 03 million  and 03 million  of net gains in 2015  and 2014  respectively and 04 million  of net losses in 2013  related to foreign currency forward contracts 

the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our forward currency exchange contracts is limited as the exposure is substantially offset by exchange rate changes of the underlying hedged amounts all outstanding open forward contracts at december 31 2015  have maturities of less than one year

 item 1 business 

our company 

we deliver microinverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production simplifies design and installation improves system uptime and reliability reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management our semiconductorbased microinverter system converts direct current dc electricity to alternating current ac electricity at the individual solar module level and brings a systembased high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors networking and embedded and webbased software technologies we are the market leader in the microinverter category and have grown rapidly since our first commercial shipment in mid2008 we have sold approximately 47 million  microinverters as of december 31 2013 which represents over 12 gigawatt dc  we were the first company to commercially ship microinverter systems in volume we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets and australia 

we were incorporated as pvi solutions inc in march 2006 in the state of delaware and changed our name to enphase energy inc in july 2007 

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters have been the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic or pv installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter as compared to microinverter systems we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar systems including the following 

 2 

 these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

 our products 

we design develop manufacture and sell a microinverter system for the solar pv industry we have built from the ground up a semiconductorbased microinverter system that converts energy at the individual solar module level and combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies provides advanced energy monitoring and control this is vastly different than the central inverter approach that can only convert energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array 

our microinverter solution brings a systembased high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors networking and embedded and webbased software technologies our microinverter system consists of three key components our enphase microinverter envoy communications gateway and enlighten webbased software 

 together our enphase microinverter envoy communications gateway and enlighten webbased software function as a single unified system that enhances energy production simplifies design and installation reduces costs increases system uptime and reliability reduces fire safety risk and provides the ability to monitor performance in realtime with an enphase microinverter system we believe solar system owners can achieve a higher return on investment over the lifetime of the solar system than would be achieved using a traditional central inverter approach 

  

key elements of our solution include 

  

productivesuperior energy production our microinverter system enables the maximum possible energy production from each module overcoming a fundamental design limitation of central inverters which are limited by the lowest performing module we believe that our microinverter systems achieve higher energy production and can generate superior returns on investment relative to central inverter solutions for system owners 

  

reliablelonger life and no single point of failure reduction of component count primarily through semiconductor integration in our microinverter allows us to design a reliable system that can withstand harsh environmental conditions in addition because we process low voltages and power levels our components experience less stress and last longer than traditional central inverters furthermore the distributed architecture of our microinverter system translates into greater system uptime if a microinverter unit fails it results in lost energy production from a single solar module only and not the entire array in addition we offer a limited warranty of up to 25 years on our microinverters 

  

simpleease of design and installation using microinverter technology an installer can design a system of any size and any roof configuration with a simple modular approach after initial installation the system can be easily expanded by even a single module our single inverter per module approach converts directly to ac and enables a simpler all ac design eliminating the extra cost training and complexity associated with typical high voltage dc implementation without these complexities installation of microinverter technology is greatly simplified improving installers productivity this also enables a new class of solar installer such as electricians and general contractors finally our microinverters are installed on the roof and hidden from view with minimal impact to the aesthetics of a home or building 

  

smartmodulelevel monitoring and analytics our microinverter system allows us to collect energy production information in real time on a per solar module basis this enables powerful system analytics and allows enphase to offer installers visibility into how systems are performing and the ability to continuously optimize energy productionwhich is particularly important when operating commercial solar installations such services include system performance and diagnostics benchmarking as well as system and module alerts and fault statistics 

  

safe“all ac” solution microinverters are safer because they process low dc voltages relative to central inverters high voltage arc faults associated with traditional central inverter are the leading cause of fires of solar pv installations microinverter technology mitigates this safety risk 

  

due to the benefits of our solution we believe solar installers achieve greater productivity and competitive differentiation over installers of traditional central inverter solar pv installations and the solar system owner achieves a higher return on investment with an enphase microinverter system over the life of the solar system 

  

our strategy 

our objective is to continue to be the leading provider of microinverter systems for the solar industry worldwide and to accelerate the shift from traditional central inverters to microinverter technology key elements of our strategy include 

 4 

utilityscale installations we expect these market segments to become a significant revenue opportunity for us in the future 

 customers and sales 

we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets and australia  we sell our microinverter systems primarily to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators who in turn integrate our products into complete solar pv installations for residential and commercial system owners we work with many of the leading solar distributors in 2013 vivint solar inc ced greentech and focused energy inc accounted for 15 14 and 11 of total net revenues respectively  in addition to our distributors we sell directly to large installers oems and strategic partners our oem customers include solar module manufacturers who bundle our products and solutions with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers strategic partners include a variety of companies and arrangements including industrial equipment suppliers and providers of solar financing solutions we also sell the enphasebranded product directly to electrical contractor distributors in north america historically revenues generated from the us market have represented more than 80 of our business with the remainder from canada europe and australia   

manufacturing quality control and key suppliers 

we outsource the manufacturing of our products to two key manufacturing partners flextronics international ltd and phoenix contact gmbh  co kg flextronics assembles and tests our microinverter pursuant to a manufacturing services agreement prices for such services are mutually agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the agreement flextronics assembly and test plants for our products are located in fuyong china and new market ontario canada flextronics also provides receiving kitting storage transportation inventory visibility and other valueadded logistics services at locations managed by flextronics pursuant to a logistics services agreement phoenix manufactures our custom ac cable pursuant to a cooperation agreement phoenixs facilities are located in poland and china in addition we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our microinverter system 

customer service 

we maintain high levels of customer engagement through our customer support group and the enlighten webbased software portal and have cultivated an organizational focus on customer satisfaction our dedicated customer support group focuses on responding to inbound inquiries regarding any of our products and services as of december 31 2013  our customer support staff consisted of 55 employees in the united states and 10 employees in europe 

in addition customized support programs are being developed for selected oem partners large direct installers and distributors to help prioritize and track support issues for key partners and to provide a single point of contact 

research and development 

we devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs of our enphase microinverter system our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that reduce the cost and optimize the effectiveness of our microinverter solutions for our customers we measure the effectiveness of our research and development against metrics including product unit cost efficiency reliability power output and easeofuse as of december 31 2013  our research and development staff consisted of 162 employees of whom 140 were located in the united states and the remainder primarily located in new zealand 

our research and development expenses were 345 million  356 million  and 251 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2013  we had 36 issued us patents 11 issued nonus patents 80 pending us patent applications and 139 pending nonus counterpart patent applications  our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2027 and 2032 

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our asics pursuant to a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture 

certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any third party manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market the license carries a seventyfive year term subject to earlier termination upon mutual agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices or cplds and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferrable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

with respect to among other things proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

  

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

  

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our microinverter technology or business plans 

seasonality 

historically sales of our products in the second third and fourth quarters have been positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles followed by a seasonally softer first quarter  although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we compete both with wellestablished traditional central inverter manufacturers and new technology startups the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

 6 

 currently competitors in the inverter market range from large international companies such as sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh and powerone inc to emerging companies offering alternative microinverter or other solar electronics products we principally compete with the large incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to our microinverter solution we believe however that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central inverter technology even when traditional central inverter technology is supplemented by dctodc optimizers sma solar technology ag and powerone inc have recently introduced or announced plans to introduce microinverter products in addition several new entrants to the microinverter market have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products including some of our oem customers and partners 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2013  we had 398 employees of the fulltime employees 161 were engaged in research and development 156 in sales and marketing 50 in a general and administrative capacity and 31 in manufacturing and operations of these employees 338 were in the united states 34 in europe 19 in new zealand four in australia two in canada and one employee in china 

  

none of our us new zealand uk and australia employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france and italy are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

we file electronically with the us securities and exchange commission or sec our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act we make available on our website at wwwenphasecom  under “investorsfinancial informationsec filings” free of charge copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing these reports with or furnishing them to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations our business could be harmed by any of these risks the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in assessing these risks you should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 

we have a history of losses which may continue in the future and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability   

we have incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and we may continue to incur additional net losses in the future we incurred net losses of 259 million  382 million  and 323 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively as of december 31 2013  we had an accumulated deficit of 1529 million  our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our offerings increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects   

we have been in existence since 2006 and did not begin shipping our products in commercial quantities until mid2008 much of our growth has occurred in recent periods our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

further our efforts to achieve broader market acceptance for our microinverter systems and to expand beyond our existing markets may never succeed which would adversely impact our ability to generate additional revenue or become profitable 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer   

our microinverter systems are utilized in solar photovoltaic or pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years   and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 

   

 8 

 if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our customers products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology recently have caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of asian manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business   

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customers electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries most notably australia canada france belgium germany italy japan the peoples republic of china the united kingdom spain and the united states have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs or fits rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being amended by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives in regions that we focus our sales efforts could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems there which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place additionally electric utility companies may establish pricing structures or interconnection requirements that could adversely affect our sales and be harmful to the solar and distributed rooftop solar generation industry 

our focus on a limited number of specific markets increases risks associated with the elimination or expiration of governmental subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications   

to date we have generated substantially all of our revenues from north america and expect to generate a substantial amount of revenues from north america in the future there are a number of important incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products a substantial majority of our revenues come from the united states which has both federal and state incentives the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provides a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations which expire on december 31 2016 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 as amended created a renewable energy grant program that offered cash payments in lieu of investment tax credits to renewable energy project developers for eligible property placed in service prior to december 31 2011 or placed in service by the specified credit termination date if construction began prior to december 31 2011 we believe the tax credit and grant programs have had a positive effect on our sales since inception 

however unless the tax credit program is further extended the eventual phaseout of this program could adversely affect sales of our products in the future 

california is the largest single solar market in the united states based on analysis from seia data and gtm research and a significant portion of our revenues are generated in california in 2007 the state of california launched its 10year 3 billion “go solar california” campaign which encourages the installation of an aggregate of 3000 mw of solar energy systems in homes and businesses by the end of 2016 the largest part of the campaign the “california solar initiative” provides rebates and performancebased incentives which decrease in intervals as installation thresholds are met the “go solar california” program is scheduled to expire on december 31 2016 but the pace of installations has been high and the program is likely to conclude sooner both pacific gas and electric and san diego gas and electric have surpassed all installation thresholds in the residential sector and are no longer accepting applications pacific gas and electric is placing all new applications for the commercial sector on a waiting list and these applications may not be able to receive incentives programs for other utilities and market segments continue but could conclude prior to december 31 2016 if installations continue at their current pace 

we also sell our products in ontario canada the ontario power authority green energy and green economy act of 2009 created two separate fit programs for projects greater than 10kw and for projects less than 10kw these fit programs provide participants with a fixed price for electricity produced over a 20year contract term both programs were recently suspended while they underwent a review the program for projects less than 10kw was reopened to new applications in july 2012 with a procurement target of 50 mw the program for projects between 10kw and 500kw was reopened for new applications between december 14 2012 and january 18 2013 with a procurement target of 200 mw the government of ontario has announced plans for annual procurement targets of 50mw of projects under 10kw and 150mw of projects between 10kw and 500kw through 2017 however all procurement occurs at the direction of the government of ontario and these plans could change or market conditions could result in procurement targets not being met furthermore the government of ontario has the authority to change the fits for future contracts at its discretion and has the authority to modify suspend or discontinue the program at any time suspension of the fit program in ontario directly impacted and could continue to impact our business furthermore any future suspension or modification of the program could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we began selling our products in france italy and the benelux region during the second quarter of 2012 we opened a sales office in the united kingdom and began selling our products there at the beginning of the third quarter a number of european countries including germany belgium and the united kingdom have adopted reductions to their fits spain announced a suspension of its fit for new renewable energy projects in january 2012 and italy concluded its fit program in july 2013 certain countries notably greece and spain have proposed or enacted taxes levied on renewable energy these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe the reductions in european tariffs and subsidies and other requirements or incentives including local content requirements or incentives have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales in europe 

in the first quarter of 2013 we began selling our products in australia in 2012 australia enacted a national price on carbon emissions intended to increase the cost of traditional energy sources thereby making renewable energy sources more attractive beginning in 2012 several states in australia also began to gradually reduce their fits as of october 2013 all fit programs in australia have expired australia recently elected a new national government the new leadership has pledged to revise national energy policy including the carbon price renewable energy target and certain renewable energy financing mechanisms the reductions in incentives and uncertainty around future energy policy may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our business in australia additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks for our business   

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including the sovereign debt issues in europe pose risks for our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have reduced demand for solar products the european sovereign debt crisis has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or 

cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability have and may continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to increase our sales in europe 

our microinverter systems may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share   

if we fail to achieve broader market acceptance of our products there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broader market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 

   

in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central inverters these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central inverter systems which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our microinverter systems 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability   

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 11 

fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

the inverter industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce microinverter products which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share   

to date we have competed primarily against central inverter manufacturers and until recently have faced little direct competition in selling our microinverter systems marketing and selling our microinverter systems against traditional inverter solutions is highly competitive currently competitors in the inverter market range from large companies such as sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh and powerone inc to emerging companies offering alternative microinverter or other solar electronics products several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger have greater financial marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for these products and technologies further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our microinverter systems in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the microinverter market and additional addon components like dctodc optimizers that can be used with central inverters gain traction we believe that a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our microinverter systems sma solar technology ag and powerone inc have recently introduced microinverter products in addition several new entrants to the microinverter market have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products including some of our oem customers and partners 

we also may face competition from some of our customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally for instance solar module manufacturers could attempt to develop components that directly perform dc to ac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers may purchase fewer of our microinverter systems or sell products that compete with our microinverters systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to continue to incur additional warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue and gross profit to decline   

we have offered 15year limited warranties for our first and second generation microinverters and offer a limited warranty of up to 25 years on our third and fourth generation microinverters our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our microinverters under normal use and service conditions for up to 25 years following installation as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized revenue our estimated costs of warranty for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty 

while we offer warranties of up to 25 years our microinverters have only been in use since mid2008 when we first commenced commercial sales of our products although we conduct accelerated life cycle testing to measure performance and reliability our microinverter systems have not been tested over the full warranty cycle and do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life in addition under realworld operating conditions which may vary by location and design as well as insolation soiling and weather conditions a typical solar pv installation may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions if our products perform below expectations or have unexpected reliability problems we may be unable to gain or retain customers and could face substantial warranty expense 

we are required to make assumptions and apply judgments based on our accelerated life cycle testing and the limited operating history of our products regarding a number of factors including the durability and reliability of our products our anticipated rate of warranty claims and the costs of replacement of defective products our assumptions have proven and could in the future prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our products which has caused and may in 

the future cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products increases in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to actual product failure rates field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting product failures have caused and could in the future cause us to materially increase the amount of warranty obligations and have had and may have in the future a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations 

we also depend significantly on our reputation for reliability and highquality products and services exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business if our products and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired and we may lose or be unable to gain or retain customers 

defects and poor performance in our products could result in loss of customers decreased revenue and unexpected expenses and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

our products must meet stringent quality requirements and may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product these errors or defects may be dangerous as defective power components may cause power overloads potentially resulting in explosion or fire as we develop new generations of our products and enter new markets we face higher risk of undetected defects because our testing protocols may not be able to fully test the products under all possible operating conditions in the past we have experienced defects in our products due to certain errors in the manufacturing and design process any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts in order to address or remedy any defects and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

furthermore defective inefficient or poorly performing power components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim also we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain this coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty and product liability claims or product recalls may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems based on our product platform may contain undetected errors failures or bugs especially when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our monitoring service could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses 

if we are unable to effectively manage our growth our business and operating results may suffer   

we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience significant growth in our sales and operations our historical growth has placed and planned future growth is expected to continue to place significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources to 

 13 

we cannot assure you that our current and planned operations personnel systems internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation business or prospects 

our recent and planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks   

we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets and australia  we also intend to expand into other international markets and to introduce new microinverter systems targeted at larger commercial and utilityscale installations our success in these new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 

 further new geographic markets and the larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

 failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these products to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources or a change in utility pricing structures may harm our business financial condition and results of operations   

we believe that a system owners decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and lowering sales of our microinverter systems in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar components industry including manufacturers of central inverters could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products additionally as increasing adoption of distributed generation places pressure on traditional utility business models or utility infrastructure utilities may change their pricing structures to make installation or operation of solar distributed generation more costly such measures can include grid access fees costly or lengthy interconnection studies limitations on distributed generation penetration levels or other measures if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our microinverter systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition   

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and cost efficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

ordering patterns from our distributors may cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period   

our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their assessment of endcustomer demand and their forecasts because these forecasts may not be accurate channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly due to the difference between their forecasts and actual demand as a result distributors adjust their purchase orders placed with us in 

response to changing channel inventory levels as well as their assessment of the latest market demand trends we have limited visibility into future end customer demand a significant decrease in our distributors channel inventory in one period may lead to a significant rebuilding of channel inventory in subsequent periods or vice versa which may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly this fluctuation may cause our results to fall short of analyst or investor expectations in a certain period which may cause our stock price to decline 

changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or other jurisdictions in which we do business such as australia canada france italy the united kingdom the benelux region and china could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example the italian energy authority aeeg enacted a new set of interconnection standards for solar energy installations that became effective in july 2012 which has negatively impacted our sales in italy we continue to explore potential solutions to meet these requirements however in the event that we cannot implement a solution in the near term the total market available for our microinverter products in italy and our business as a result may continue to be adversely impacted 

in addition several states including louisiana and california have either implemented or are considering implementing new restrictions on incentives or rule regulating the installation of solar systems that we may not be able to currently comply with in the event that we cannot comply with these or other new regulations or implement a solution to such noncompliance as they arise the total market available for our microinverter products in such states and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations which would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries where we offer our products for sale any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers   

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products in particular we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of microinverter products cabling and our communications gateway related to our microinverter systems our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our other manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our microinverters related cabling and communications gateway products are manufactured are located outside of the united states we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the united states increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn 

would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our relationships with our distributors and end customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation   

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in our manufacturing partners fabrication facility due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes or those of some thirdparty contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of production lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension of manufacturing production lines could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers   

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components of our products for example our asics are purchased from a sole source supplier or developed for us by sole source suppliers any of the sole source and limited source suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues could stop producing our components cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes are currently too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms including price or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of sole source or limited source components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business   

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us 

directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if potential owners of solar pv systems based on our product platform are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms we could experience a reduction in the demand for our solar pv systems   

many owners of solar pv systems depend on financing to purchase their systems the limited use of microinverters to date coupled with our limited operating history could result in lenders refusing to provide the financing necessary to purchase solar pv systems based on our product platform on favorable terms or at all moreover in the case of debt financed projects even if lenders are willing to finance the purchase of these systems an increase in interest rates or a change in tax incentives could make it difficult for owners to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all in addition we believe that a significant percentage of owners purchase solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of upfront cash and financing difficulties in obtaining financing for solar pv installations on favorable terms or increases in interest rates or changes in tax incentives could lower an investors return on investment in a solar pv installation or make alternative solar pv systems or other investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems based on our product platform any of these events could result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition an increasing share of residential solar installations has been provided through third party financing structures such as power purchase or lease agreements our sales growth therefore increasingly depends on sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings who provide solar as a service via power purchase agreements or leasing structures the third party finance market for residential solar in the us and elsewhere is or may become highly concentrated with a few significant finance companies and several smaller entrants if we are unable develop relationships and gain a significant share of inverter sales to the major finance companies or new entrants our overall sales growth will be constrained 

we rely primarily on distributors and large installers to assist in selling our products and the failure of these customers to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue   

we sell our microinverter systems primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings in 2013 vivint solar inc ced greentech and focused energy inc accounted for 15 14 and 11 of total net revenues respectively  we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties and as a result many of our customers also market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our customers may terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our customers may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors in addition participants in the solar industry are becoming increasingly focused on vertical integration of the solar financing and installation process which may lead to an overall reduction in the number of potential parties who may purchase and install our products 

our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with current customers failure by these customers to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new customer relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

our success in an “ac module” version of our microinverter system may depend in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers   

we are currently working on variants of our microinverter system that will enable an “ac module” for direct attachment of the microinverter to the solar modules the market success of such solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with solar module manufacturers to design solar modules that are compatible with such direct 

attachment of our microinverter we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions combining our microinverter system and solar modules for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial changes faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer   

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled technical people is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business if we fail to retain our senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business could suffer 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed   

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the united states and in certain other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the united states we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade secrets in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert managements attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate   

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against certain of our competitors from time to time we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert managements attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses while 

we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the united states and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties patent rights or that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents or patent applications as we become more visible as a publicly traded company the possibility that third parties may make claims of intellectual property infringement or other violations against us may grow an adverse outcome with respect to any such claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

 any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

from time to time we have licensed and in the future we may choose to or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products we cannot assure that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with applicable open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code any of the foregoing could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles 

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations in the future particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months such as northern europe canada and the united states in general we expect our products in the second third and fourth quarters have been positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles followed by a seasonally softer first quarter  in the united states customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future 

covenants in our credit facilities may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

we have lending arrangements with several financial institutions including loan and security agreements with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” and with hercules technology growth capital inc “hercules” the loan and security agreements with wells fargo and with hercules restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring 

additional debt encumbering our tangible or intangible property paying dividends or engaging in certain transactions such as mergers and acquisitions investments and asset sales our loan and security agreement with wells fargo also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including liquidity ratios while our agreement with hercules includes a condition precedent to borrowing that is subject to us achieving certain financial objectives these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under our loan and security agreements with wells fargo and hercules are secured by substantially all of our assets excluding intellectual property which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness and the forfeiture of our assets subject to security interests in favor of the lenders 

we are an “emerging growth company” and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which could make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act and for as long as we continue to be an “emerging growth company” we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we could be an “emerging growth company” until december 31 2017 the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering although we could cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier if certain events occur as specified in the jobs act such as our achieving annual revenue of at least 1 billion or our becoming a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule 12b2 of the exchange act we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act requires us to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls procedures the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 has required and will continue to require significant attention of management although we are currently not required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting otherwise required by section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 this exemption will no longer be available to us beginning with our first annual report on 10k for the year in which we cease to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act enacted in april 2012 or the jobs act if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in the future the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price in addition a delay in compliance with section 404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions including sec action ineligibility for short form resale registration the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the stock exchange on which it is listed and the inability of registered brokerdealers to make a market in our common stock which would further reduce our stock price and could harm our business to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our ability to use net operating losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the internal revenue code and may be subject to further limitation as a result of future transactions 

sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change which is generally any cumulative change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear period to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in the years after the ownership change these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes 

involving stockholders who directly or indirectly own 5 or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company generally if an ownership change occurs the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change as a result we may be unable to offset our taxable income with net operating losses or our tax liability with credits before these losses and credits expire 

in addition it is possible that future transactions including issuances of new shares of our common stock and sales of shares of our common stock will cause us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes in that event we generally would not be able to use our net operating losses from periods prior to this ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by sections 382 and 383 and those attributes that are already subject to limitations as a result of our prior ownership changes may be subject to more stringent limitations 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert managements attention from other aspects of our business 

we are subject to a wide variety of rules and regulations as a public reporting company the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act the sarbanesoxley act and the rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market impose significant regulatory requirements on public companies including specific corporate governance practices for example the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors audit and compensation committees distribution of annual and interim reports stockholder meetings stockholder approvals solicitation of proxies conflicts of interest stockholder voting rights and codes of conduct our management and other personnel are required to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly as a public company being subject to these rules and regulations makes it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and in the future we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial additional costs to maintain the same or similar coverage these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as executive officers 

these rules and regulations also contain requirements that apply to manufacturers of products incorporating specified minerals the doddfrank act requires public companies to report on their use of socalled conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or its nine immediate neighbors certain minerals commonly used in semiconductors are on the list of conflict minerals and additional minerals may be added to the list in the future compliance with these rules which will require us to disclose our use of these minerals and may require us to obtain an annual audit of our sourcing and the chain of custody of these minerals will be timeconsuming and costly 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents available credit facilities and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 

 we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations expand our research and development sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events including unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 

natural disasters terrorist or cyber attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in petaluma california is located near major earthquake fault lines further a terrorist attack including one aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our webbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products in the event that an earthquake tsunami typhoon terrorist or cyber attack or other natural manmade or technical catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this section of this annual report on form 10k and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter this variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations these fluctuations are due to numerous factors including 

 23 

 the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

our principal stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our stockholders may not view as beneficial 

as of february 28 2014  our executive officers directors greater than 5 stockholders and entities that are affiliated with them beneficially owned approximately 61 of our outstanding common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock as of february 28 2014  we had approximately 422 million  shares of common stock outstanding all of which are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition the terms of our bank loan agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends consequently an investors only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

overview 

we deliver microinverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production simplifies design and installation improves system uptime and reliability reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management we were founded in march 2006 and have grown rapidly to become the market leader in the microinverter category since our first commercial shipment in mid2008 we have sold approximately 47 million  microinverters as of december 31 2013  which represents over 12 gigawatt dc  we sell our products in the we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the united states canada the united kingdom france the benelux region certain other european markets and australia 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers “oems” and strategic partners historically revenues generated from the us market have represented more than 80 of our business with the remainder from canada europe and australia   

we have experienced significant revenue growth since our first commercial shipment in mid2008 our net revenues were  2328 million  2167 million  and 1495 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively which reflects deeper market penetration and broader acceptance of microinverter technology we incurred net losses of 259 million  382 million  and 323 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively as we invested significant resources to develop new product offerings and focused on critical research and development activities required to reduce product costs increase performance and foster innovation we also expanded our operations into new product markets and geographies and invested in our operational infrastructure to support anticipated growth 

 our fulltime employee headcount has grown from 298 at december 31 2011 to 398 at december 31 2013 we do not expect similar growth rates in headcount in the near term we believe the investments we have made in our corporate infrastructure will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases in research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

components of consolidated statements of operations 

net revenues 

we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems which include microinverter units an envoy communications gateway device and our enlighten webbased monitoring service we sell to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners 

our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems driven by supply and demand sales incentives and competitive product offerings our revenue growth is dependent on our continual development and introduction of new products to meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers the diversification and expansion of our revenue base and our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology and differentiates us in the marketplace 

cost of revenues and gross profit 

cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs warranty manufacturing personnel and logistics costs depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs our product costs are impacted by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in 

lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation certain costs primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the growing demand for our products for the foreseeable future however shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products 

in addition third parties including one of our contract manufacturers serve as our logistics providers by warehousing and delivering our products in north america europe and australia 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product cost product mix warranty costs including changes in estimates and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes recruiting costs sales commissions and stockbased compensation we believe the investments we have made in our corporate infrastructure will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases in research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

research and development expense includes personnelrelated expenses such as salaries stockbased compensation and employee benefits research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors powerline communications and networking and software functionality research and development expense also includes thirdparty design and development costs testing and evaluation costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources in ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs improve functionality and enhance reliability we intend to continue to invest substantial resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position 

sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnelrelated expenses such as salaries commissions stockbased compensation employee benefits and travel it also includes trade shows marketing customer support and other indirect costs we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and enter into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors large installers oems and strategic partners historically substantially all of our sales have been in the united states and canada we began selling into france italy and the benelux region in the fourth quarter of 2011 and commenced volume shipments to such regions in the second quarter of 2012 in addition we opened a sales office in the united kingdom during the second quarter of 2012 and began shipping products to the united kingdom in the third quarter of 2012 in late 2013 we opened a sales office and began shipping products in australia we believe the investments we have made in sales and marketing to date will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases from current levels of sales and marketing expenses however we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future 

  

general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries stockbased compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services professional services consist primarily of outside legal accounting and information technology consulting costs we believe the investments we have made in our corporate infrastructure to date will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases from current levels of general and administrative expenses 

other income expense net 

other income expense net includes interest income on invested cash balances and interest expense on amounts outstanding under our credit and convertible note facilities and noncash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs other income expense net also includes marktomarket adjustments to record our preferred stock warrants at fair value prior to our initial public offering of our common stock or ipo which were issued in conjunction with credit facilities as well as losses or gains on conversion of nonus dollar transactions into us dollars and foreign currency forward contracts 

provision for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products historically we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly we have not recorded any us federal or state income tax provision for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception a provision for income taxes of 09 million  and 07 million  has been recognized for 2013  and 2012  respectively related to our foreign operations due to the history of losses we have generated since inception we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 

summary consolidated statements of operations 

  

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented in thousands 

  



comparison of 2013  2012  and 2011   

  

net revenues 

  



  

2013 compared to 2012   net revenues increased by 7  to 2328 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the increase in microinverter units shipped as well as a larger mix of microinverter accessories the number of microinverter units sold increased by 8 from approximately 1510000 units in 2012 to approximately 1625000 units in 2013 substantially all units shipped in both years consisted of our third generation product during 2013 we continued to experience a decline in the average selling price of our microinverters the decline in average selling price reflected and was consistent with recent trends in the solar industry 

  

2012 compared to 2011  net revenues increased by 45  to 2167 million  in 2012  compared to 2011 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the increase in microinverter units shipped the number of microinverter units sold increased by 51  from approximately 1002000  units in 2011 to approximately 1510000  units in 2012 the overall increase in units sold was attributable primarily to sales of our third generation microinverter which was introduced during the second quarter of 2011 in addition the increase in unit sales was driven by deeper penetration of our existing customer base the addition of new customers and broader acceptance of our products resulting from among other factors investments made in sales and marketing during 2012 we continued to experience a decline in the average selling price of our microinverters the decline in average selling price reflected and was consistent with recent trends in the solar industry 

  

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  



  

2013 compared to 2012  cost of revenues increased by 3  in 2013 as compared to 2012 while net revenues increased by 7  the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of microinverter units sold to customers consistent with the overall increase in net revenues as described above gross margin increased by 35 percentage points to 290 in 2013 as compared to 255 in 2012 primarily due to a lower cost per microinverter unit and larger mix of sales from microinverter accessories while our third generation product represented substantially all of 2013 and 2012 sales we were able to achieve lower per unit costs in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to production efficiencies gained through experience with the manufacturing process which had a favorable impact on gross margin costs of revenues in 2013 and 2012 included warranty expense of 103 million  and 76 million  respectively resulting from net changes in estimates which reduced gross margin by approximately 44 and 35 percentage points respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

2012 compared to 2011  cost of revenues increased by 34 in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of microinverter units sold to customers consistent with the overall increase in net revenues as described above gross margin increased by 61 percentage points to 255 in 2012 as compared to 194 in 2011 the increase was primarily driven by a 8 percentage point increase from a larger mix of our highermargin third generation microinverter which has a lower per unit manufacturing cost than our second generation microinverter the lower per unit cost was achieved primarily through design enhancements which resulted in a higher level of semiconductor integration and improved efficiencies on increased production volume in addition gross margin improved by 2 percentage points in 2012 as a result of a reduction in usage of expedited airfreight for finished goods due to improvements in delivery scheduling these increases were partially offset by a 4 percentage point reduction to gross margin due to a net increase in warranty expense primarily attributable to changes in estimates to warranty obligations associated with our previous generation products see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

research and development 

  



  

2013 compared to 2012  research and development expenses decreased by 11 million  in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a 16 million decrease in outside contract services offset by a 03 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to research and development equipment and a 02 million increase in personnelrelated costs 

  

2012 compared to 2011  research and development expenses increased by 105 million  in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a 78 million increase in personnelrelated costs as a result of increases in research and development headcount the increase in headcount reflects our continuing investment in enhancements of existing products as well as efforts to bring new products to market in addition the use of outside services for the development of new products and depreciation and 

amortization related to research and development equipment increased by 16 million and 10 million respectively as compared to 2011 

sales and marketing 

  



  

2013 compared to 2012  sales and marketing expenses increased by 51 million  in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in customer service headcount and operations in domestic and international markets personnelrelated costs increased by 40 million which included a 06 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation costs associated with establishing our presence in australia contributed an additional 18 million to the increase in 2013 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses primarily attributable to lower expenditures on trade shows of 06 million 

  

2012 compared to 2011  sales and marketing expenses increased by 85 million  in 2012  as compared to 2011  primarily due to increases in sales and marketing headcount to support higher sales volumes and international expansion personnelrelated costs increased by 65 million which included a 24 million increase due to additions in sales and marketing headcount for international locations costs related to trade shows the use of outside services and facilities related costs contributed an additional 10 million to the increase in 2012 in addition bad debt expense increased by 09 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 

  

general and administrative 

  



  

2013 compared to 2012  general and administrative expenses decreased by 09 million  in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily as a result of decreased use of outside consultants and professional services the decrease in general and administrative expenditures reflected our ongoing expense management measures

other income expense net 

  



  

2013 compared to 2012  other expense decreased by 35 million  in 2013 as compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily attributable to the 28 million charge recorded as interest expense in 2012 upon conversion of our convertible facility at our ipo in addition interest expense related to outstanding debt balances was lower in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to lower average debt levels 

  

2012 compared to 2011  other expense increased by 28 million  in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase was attributable to a 34 million increase in interest expense of which 28 million was from writeoffs of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount as a result of the early extinguishment of convertible debt and term loans and the termination of a revolving line of credit in addition foreign currency losses contributed 04 million to the increase the increases were partially offset by a 08 million decrease in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant prior to the liability being reclassified as equity upon our ipo 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

prior to our ipo in april 2012 we funded our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes and proceeds from term loans on april 4 2012 we completed our ipo in which we issued and sold 10315151 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately 538 million as of december 31 2013  we had 382 million  in cash and cash equivalents which are held primarily in general checking accounts and 571 million  in working ca pital substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in the united states with the remainder held in various foreign subsidiaries 

  

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented in thousands 

  



  

net cash used in operating activities 

  

we have experienced negative operating cash flows as we invested significant resources to develop new product offerings and focused on critical research and development activities required to reduce product costs increase performance and foster innovation in addition we used cash to expand our operations into new product markets and geographies and invested in our operational infrastructure to support the growth of our business 

for 2013 net cash used in operating activities was 09 million  our net loss of 259 million  was substantially offset by noncash charges and net changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash items included 70 million  of depreciation and amortization 69 million of stockbased compensation a provision for doubtful accounts of 07 million  and 04 million  of noncash interest expense in addition cash provided by net changes in operating assets and liabilities was 100 million  

sources of cash totaled 164 million resulting from an increase of 76 million  in accounts payable accrued liabilities and warranty obligations an increase of 56 million  in deferred revenues and a 32 million decrease from lower inventory levels the 76 million  increase in accounts payable accrued liabilities and warranty obligations was primarily attributable to a 91 million increase in warranty obligations partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities corresponding with reduced inventory purchases the increase in deferred revenue of 56 million  relates to our enlighten webbased monitoring service revenues the decrease in inventories was the result of improved working capital management uses of cash included a 50 million  increase in accounts receivable and a 14 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 

for 2012 net cash used in operating activities was 446 million primarily resulting from a net loss of 382 million the net loss was partially offset by noncash items including depreciation and amortization of 56 million stockbased compensation of 48 million and interest expense of 48 million in addition the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities resulted in the use of cash totaling 222 million 

the primary use of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities in 2012 was attributable to an 186 million decrease in deferred revenues which was primarily due to shipments of products during 2012 for which upfront payments of 230 million were received from customers in december 2011 as discussed below in addition other uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities included an 110 million increase in accounts receivable and an 86 million increase in inventoryrelated purchases both consistent with the overall growth of our business in 2012 as compared to 2011 offsetting these uses of cash was an increase in accounts payable of 168 million which was also driven by the growth of our business 

for 2011 notwithstanding a net loss of 323 million net cash used in operating activities was 04 million  primarily due to a 254 million increase in deferred revenues in december 2011 we entered into several agreements to sell microinverters to customers with product delivery in 2012 these agreements were due in part to the anticipated expiration of certain government incentives for investments in renewable energy projects on december 31 2011 prior to december 31 2011 we received 294 million in cash in advance from these customers of which 64 million and 230 million were recorded as revenues and deferred revenues respectively our net loss included noncash charges in the form of depreciation and amortization of 30 million stockbased compensation of 21 million and noncash interest expense of 18 million related to the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs changes in working capital items other than deferred revenues used 10 million of operating cash flow and consisted of increases in accounts receivable inventory and prepaid and other assets offset by increases in accounts payable accrued liabilities and warranty obligations 

net cash used in investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to capital expenditures to support our growth 

  

for 2013  net cash used in investing activities of 63 million  included purchases of test and assembly equipment and the development of software for internal use 

  

for 2012  net cash used in investing activities of 130 million  included purchases of test equipment and expenditures on leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in connection with our relocation to a new headquarter facility

debt obligations 

  

our debt obligations are summarized below as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all required financial covenants of our debt facilities 

  

revolving credit facility— we have a 500 million  revolving credit facility the “revolver” with wells fargo bank na “wells fargo” which had a maturity date of november 7 2015 on february 14 2014 we entered into an amendment which granted an automatic extension of the maturity date from november 7 2015 to november 7 2016 provided we have not borrowed any amounts under the additional term loans made available by hercules technology growth capital inc hercules as described below or otherwise restructure the additional term loans to the satisfaction of wells fargo the amount of loans available to be drawn under the revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation that limits availability to a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus a percentage of the value of eligible domestic inventory less certain reserves wells fargo and hercules are parties to an intercreditor agreement pursuant to which hercules has a first lien on certain of our assets and a second priority on our other assets subject to the intercreditor agreement loans under the revolver are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property loans under the revolver bear interest in cash at an annual rate equal to at our option either libor or a “base rate” that is comprised of among other things the prime rate plus a margin that is between 15  and 425  depending on the currency borrowed and the specific term of repayment the revolver contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default and requires us to maintain at least 150 million  of liquidity at all times of which at least 80 million  50 million in the case the 

maturity date is november 7 2016 must be undrawn availability to date we have not drawn on the revolver and approximately 224 million  was available for borrowing as of december 31 2013 based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances pursuant to the agreement 

  

term loans —we have a loan and security agreement with hercules pursuant to which we borrowed 74 million  the initial term loan in addition we may borrow an additional 156 million  in term loans the additional term loans which must be drawn if at all not later than march 31 2014 to date we have not and do not intend to borrow any additional term loans prior to its impending expiration on march 31 2014 as we believe the amounts available under the revolver expiring in november 2015 or november 2016 provided we do not borrow any amounts under the additional term loans will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs through fiscal 2014 we used the proceeds of the initial term loan to replenish cash on hand which had previously been used to repay the approximately 75 million  in other outstanding term loans loans under the hercules facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to the higher of i the prime rate plus 825  or b 115  all loans under the hercules facility will mature on august 1 2016 interest is payable in cash on a monthly basis and the loans will amortize in equal monthly installments commencing on march 1 2014 for the initial term loan in addition the facility includes a 06 million end of term charge due on august 1 2016 prepayments of loans under the facility are subject to early payment penalties loans under the hercules facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets other than intellectual property the hercules facility does not include any financial covenants as of december 31 2013 the outstanding principal balance under the term loans was 74 million  which solely relates to borrowings under the initial term loan   

equipment financing facility— the company has an equipment financing facility with hercules the equipment financing facility has a variable interest rate set at the higher of 575  above the prime lending rate and 90  annually and expires july 1 2014 this facility is secured by the financed equipment and restricts our ability to pay dividends and take on certain types of additional liens as of december 31 2013  the outstanding principal balance under the equipment financing facility was 13 million  

  

operating and capital expenditure requirements 

  

our future capital requirements may vary materially in the future and will depend on many factors including but not limited to our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and other costs necessary to support our strategy 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents of 382 million  as of december 31 2013  together with borrowings expected to be available under our revolver with wells fargo will be adequate to fund our debt obligations as well as our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements over the next 12 months 

if additional sources of liquidity were needed we may consider new debt or equity offerings but there is no assurance that such transactions could be consummated on acceptable terms or at all failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  

  





 37 

times andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product the timing and amount of payments represent our best estimate and may change due to changing business needs and other factors certain agreements specify future quantities and pricing of products to be supplied by our contract manufacturers for periods up to seven years of the 876 million  included in purchase commitments 725 million  are cancelable however if canceled the agreement requires us to pay cancellation penalties of up to 56 million  

  

as of december 31 2013  the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties was approximately 04 million since the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlements cannot be predicted due to the high degree of uncertainty liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

since our inception we have not engaged in any offbalance sheet arrangements including the use of structured finance special purpose entities or variable interest entities 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap note 2 to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected 

we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and if it entails significant judgment subjectivity and complexity on the part of management in its application we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenue from sales of our microinverter systems which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway device and an enlighten webbased monitoring service to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners enlighten service revenue represented less than 1  of our total revenues for all periods presented 

  

revenues from sales of microinverters and related accessories and communication gateways are recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement and title of and risk of loss have passed to the customer iii the sale price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 

sales of an envoy communications gateway device include our enlighten webbased monitoring service the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on the best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including internal costs gross margin and historical pricing practices after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using the best estimate of the selling price i revenue from the sale of envoy devices is recognized upon shipment assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met and ii revenue from the webbased monitoring service is recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices of 10 years 

  

inventory valuation 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value 

  

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

  

warranty obligations 

  

microinverters sold through december 31 2013 

  

our warranty accrual provides for the replacement of microinverter units that fail during the product’s warranty term 15 years for first and second generation microinverters and up to 25 years for third and fourth generation microinverters on a quarterly basis we employ a consistent systematic and rational methodology to assess the adequacy of our warranty obligations this assessment includes updating all key estimates and assumptions for each generation of product based on historical results trends and the most current data available as of the filing date the key estimates and assumptions used in the warranty obligations are thoroughly reviewed by management on a quarterly basis the key estimates used to estimate warranty obligations are 1 the number of units expected to fail over time ie failure rate 2 the number of failed units expected to result in warranty claims over time ie claim rate and 3 the per unit cost of replacement units including outbound shipping and limited labor costs expected to be incurred to replace failed units over time ie replacement cost 

  

estimated failure rates— our quality and reliability department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of microinverter to establish initial failure rate estimates for each generation of microinverter our quality engineers use a combination of industry standard mtbf mean time between failure estimates for individual components contained in our microinverters third party data collected on similar equipment deployed in outdoor environments similar to those in which our microinverters are installed and rigorous long term reliability and accelerated life cycle testing which simulates the service life of the microinverter in a short period of time as units are deployed into production environments we continue to monitor product performance via our enlighten monitoring platform it typically takes three to nine months between the date of sale and date of enduser installation consequently our ability to monitor actual failures of units sold similarly lags by three to nine months when a microinverter fails and is returned we perform diagnostic root cause failure analysis to understand and isolate the underlying mechanisms causing the failure we then use the results of this analysis combined with the actual cumulative performance data collected on those units prior to failure via enlighten to draw conclusions with respect to how or if the identified failure mechanisms will impact the remaining units deployed in the installed base 

  

estimated claim rates— warranty claim rate estimates are based upon assumptions with respect to expected customer behavior over the warranty period as the vast majority of our microinverters have been sold to end users for residential applications we believe that warranty claim rates will be affected over time by changes in residential home ownership because we expect that subsequent homeowners are less likely to file claims than the homeowners who originally purchase the microinverters 

  

estimated replacement costs— three factors are considered in our analysis of estimated replacement cost 1 the estimated cost of replacement microinverters 2 the estimated cost to ship replacement microinverters to end users and 3 the estimated labor reimbursement expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for the end user because our warranty provides for the replacement of defective microinverters over long periods of time either 15 or 25 years depending on the generation of product purchased the estimated per unit cost of current and future product generations is considered in the estimated replacement cost estimated costs to ship replacement units are based on observable marketbased shipping costs paid by us to third party freight carriers we have a separate program that allows thirdparty installers to claim fixeddollar reimbursements for labor costs they incur to replace failed microinverter units for a limited time from the date of original installation included in our estimated replacement cost is an analysis of the number of fixeddollar labor reimbursements expected to be claimed by third party installers over the limited offering period 

  

if actual failure rates claim rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods changes to these estimates would be required resulting in increases or decreases in our warranty obligations such increases or decreases could be material 

  

changes in estimates related to warranty obligations resulted in net increases in warranty expense of 103 million  76 million  and 18 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

fair value option for microinverters sold since january 1 2014 

  

our warranty obligations related to microinverters sold since january 1 2014 provides us the right but not the requirement to assign our warranty obligations to a thirdparty pursuant to accounting standards codification asc 820 fair value measurement  such warranties are eligible to be accounted for at fair value we expect to elect the fair value option to measure all eligible warranties associated with microinverters sold subsequent to january 1 2014 

  

in addition to the key estimates of failure rates claim rates and replacement costs described above the fair value of warranty obligations will require the use of certain level 3 inputs which are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement such additional assumptions will include a discount rate based upon our creditadjusted riskfree rate and a hypothetical profit margin and risk premium required of a hypothetical market participant to assume the obligation warranty obligations initially recorded at fair value computed using an expected present value technique at the time of sale will be subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date in addition the fair value of the liability will be accreted over the corresponding term of the warranty of up to 25 years using the effective interest method any changes in fair value of the liability from periodtoperiod including accretion expense will be recognized in cost of revenues warranty obligations recorded at fair value are expected to be lower as compared to our previous accounting at estimated costs primarily due to the effects of discounting to net present value 

  

as of december 31 2013 warranty obligations were 304 million periodic adjustments necessitated by actual experience of claims and any future changes in estimates to this liability associated with sales prior to december 31 2013 will continue to be accounted for on an undiscounted basis 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  concentrations of credit risk and major customers 

  

we are potentially subject to financial instrument concentration of credit risk through our cash equivalents and accounts receivables we place our cash and cash equivalents with high quality institutions and perform periodic evaluations of their relative credit standing accounts receivables can be potentially exposed to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers as of december 31 2013  we had amounts due from two  customers that represented 16  and 10  of the total accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2012  our two  largest accounts receivable balances represented 21  and 16  of the total accounts receivable balance in 2013  3  customers accounted for 15  14  and 11  of total net revenues in 2012  two  customers accounted for 16  and 11  of total net revenues in 2011  three  customers accounted for 17  11  and 10  of total net revenues 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros british pounds and australian and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european australian and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

in june 2012 we began to utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to anticipated cash receipts from expected future revenues denominated in euros and intercompany transaction gains or losses the contracts we enter into typically have maturities of less than one year we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the foreign currency forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

the following table presents the company’s financial instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy at december 31 2013  and 2012  in thousands 



the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our forward currency exchange contracts is limited as the exposure is substantially offset by exchange rate changes of the underlying hedged amounts all outstanding open forward contracts at december 31 2013  matured in january 2014

 item 1 business 

our company 

we deliver microinverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production simplifies design and installation improves system uptime and reliability reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management our semiconductorbased microinverter system converts direct current dc electricity to alternating current ac electricity at the individual solar module level and brings a systembased high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors networking and embedded and webbased software technologies we are the market leader in the microinverter category and have grown rapidly since our first commercial shipment in mid2008 with more than 3000000 units sold to date we were the first company to commercially ship microinverter systems in volume our products are certified for installation in the united states canada france the united kingdom italy and the benelux region 

we were incorporated as pvi solutions inc in march 2006 in the state of delaware and changed our name to enphase energy inc in july 2007 

industry background 

historically traditional central inverters have been the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic or pv installations in an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter the solar pv modules are connected in series strings in a large installation there are multiple series strings connected in parallel the aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter as compared to microinverter systems we believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar systems including the following 

 2 

is not performing to specification the resulting loss of energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time 

 these challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners 

 our products 

we design develop manufacture and sell a microinverter system for the solar pv industry we have built from the ground up a semiconductorbased microinverter system that converts energy at the individual solar module level and combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies provides advanced energy monitoring and control this is vastly different than the central inverter approach that can only convert energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array 

our microinverter solution brings a systembased high technology approach to solar energy generation leveraging our design expertise across power electronics semiconductors networking and embedded and webbased software technologies our microinverter system consists of three key components our enphase microinverter envoy communications gateway and enlighten webbased software 

 together our enphase microinverter envoy communications gateway and enlighten webbased software function as a single unified system that enhances energy production simplifies design and installation reduces costs increases system uptime and reliability reduces fire safety risk and provides the ability to monitor performance in realtime with an enphase microinverter system we believe solar system owners can achieve a higher return on investment over the lifetime of the solar system than would be achieved using a traditional central inverter approach 

  

key elements of our solution include 

  

productivesuperior energy production our microinverter system enables the maximum possible energy production from each module overcoming a fundamental design limitation of central inverters which are limited 

by the lowest performing module we believe that our microinverter systems achieve higher energy production and can generate superior returns on investment relative to central inverter solutions for system owners 

  

reliablelonger life and no single point of failure reduction of component count primarily through semiconductor integration in our microinverter allows us to design a reliable system that can withstand harsh environmental conditions in addition because we process low voltages and power levels our components experience less stress and last longer than traditional central inverters furthermore the distributed architecture of our microinverter system translates into greater system uptime if a microinverter unit fails it results in lost energy production from a single solar module only and not the entire array in addition we offer a limited warranty of up to 25 years on our microinverters 

  

simpleease of design and installation using microinverter technology an installer can design a system of any size and any roof configuration with a simple modular approach after initial installation the system can be easily expanded by even a single module our single inverter per module approach converts directly to ac and enables a simpler all ac design eliminating the extra cost training and complexity associated with typical high voltage dc implementation without these complexities installation of microinverter technology is greatly simplified improving installers productivity this also enables a new class of solar installer such as electricians and general contractors finally our microinverters are installed on the roof and hidden from view with minimal impact to the aesthetics of a home or building 

  

smartmodulelevel monitoring and analytics our microinverter system allows us to collect energy production information in real time on a per solar module basis this enables powerful system analytics and allows enphase to offer installers visibility into how systems are performing and the ability to continuously optimize energy productionwhich is particularly important when operating commercial solar installations such services include system performance and diagnostics benchmarking as well as system and module alerts and fault statistics 

  

safe“all ac” solution perhaps most important to both installers and system owners microinverters are safer because they process low dc voltages relative to central inverters high voltage arc faults associated with traditional central inverter are the leading cause of fires of solar pv installations microinverter technology mitigates this safety risk 

  

due to the benefits of our solution we believe solar installers achieve greater productivity and competitive differentiation over installers of traditional central inverter solar pv installations and the solar system owner achieves a higher return on investment with an enphase microinverter system over the life of the solar system 

  

our strategy 

our objective is to continue to be the leading provider of microinverter systems for the solar industry worldwide and to accelerate the shift from traditional central inverters to microinverter technology key elements of our strategy include 

 4 

in the future 

 customers and sales 

today our microinverter system is sold in the united states canada france the united kingdom italy and the benelux region we sell our microinverter systems primarily to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators who in turn integrate our products into complete solar pv installations for residential and commercial system owners we work with many of the leading solar distributors in 2012 focused energy inc and sunwize technologies inc each accounted for more than 10 of our net revenues and collectively both accounted for 27 of our total net revenues in addition to our distributors we sell directly to large installers oems and strategic partners our oem customers include solar module manufacturers who bundle our products and solutions with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers strategic partners include a variety of companies and arrangements including industrial equipment suppliers and providers of solar financing solutions we also sell the enphasebranded product directly to electrical contractor distributors in north america historically us net revenues have comprised more than 85 of our business with the remainder from canada and europe

our research and development expenses were 356 million 251 million and 143 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology as of december 31 2012 we had 23 issued us patents five issued nonus patents 73 patent applications pending for examination in the united states and 125 independent patent applications pending for examination in other countries all of which are related to us applications 

eleven of our issued us patents directly relate to dc to ac power conversion for alternative energy power systems the remaining 12 cover power wiring detection and control of dc arcs inverter module design antiislanding safety technology measurement of grid voltage and monitoring circuits coupled to ac lines respectively our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2027 and 2032 

we license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our asics pursuant to a fullypaid royaltyfree license which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain asic hardware should the licensor fail under certain conditions to deliver such technology in the future this license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any third party manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market the license carries a seventyfive year term subject to earlier termination upon mutual agreement of the parties or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor 

we also license digital intellectual property cores or ip blocks for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products including our asics complex programmable logic devices or cplds and fieldprogrammable gate arrays or fpgas this is a fullypaid nonexclusive nontransferrable royaltyfree license providing for the integration of such digital ip blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products other than in connection with the distribution of our products our use of such digital ip blocks is limited to certain of our business sites the license is perpetual subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us in addition we license open source software from third parties for integration into our envoy products such open source software is licensed under open source licenses these licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer which we provide via our website 

we continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to dc to ac power conversion for alternative energy power systems as well as power system monitoring control and management systems 

with respect to among other things proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our microinverter manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes test equipment designs algorithms and procedures 

  

all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us 

  

we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our microinverter technology or business plans 

  

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property claims 

seasonality 

historically sales of our products in the third and fourth quarters have been positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we compete both with wellestablished traditional central inverter manufacturers and new technology startups the principal areas in which we compete with other companies include 

 6 

 currently competitors in the inverter market range from large international companies such as sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh and powerone inc to emerging companies offering alternative microinverter or other solar electronics products we principally compete with the large incumbent solar inverter companies because traditional central inverter solutions can be used as alternatives to our microinverter solution we believe however that our microinverter solutions offer significant advantages and competitive differentiation relative to traditional central inverter technology even when traditional central inverter technology is supplemented by dctodc optimizers sma solar technology ag power one inc and sunpower corp leading inverter vendors serving the residential and small commercial inverter markets are expected to ship microinverter products in 2013 in addition several new entrants to the microinverter market including some of our oem customers and partners have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2012  we had 384 employees of the fulltime employees 160 were engaged in research and development 141 in sales and marketing 54 in a general and administrative capacity and 29 in manufacturing and operations of these employees 320 were in the united states 35 in europe 22 in new zealand five in china and two in canada 

  

none of our us new zealand or uk employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france and italy are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any employmentrelated work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

  

available information 

  

we file electronically with the us securities and exchange commission or sec our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act we make available on our website at wwwenphasecom  under “investorsfinancial informationsec filings” free of charge copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing these reports with or furnishing them to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely harmed additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

we have a history of losses which may continue in the future and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability   

we have incurred net losses in each quarter since we began doing business and we may continue to incur additional net losses in the future we incurred net losses of 382 million  323 million  and 218 million  for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively as of december 31 2012  we had an accumulated deficit of 1270 million  our revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons many of which are outside our control including a decline in demand for our offerings increased competition a decrease in the growth of the solar industry or our market share or our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities if we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects   

we have been in existence since 2006 and did not begin shipping our products in commercial quantities until mid2008 much of our growth has occurred in recent periods our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries including increased expenses as we continue to grow our business if we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully our business will suffer 

since we began commercial shipments of our products our revenue gross profit and results of operations have varied and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors many of which are not within our control it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue and gross profit and plan expenses accordingly and therefore it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations 

further our efforts to achieve broader market acceptance for our microinverter systems and to expand beyond our existing markets may never succeed which would adversely impact our ability to generate additional revenue or become profitable 

if demand for solar energy solutions does not continue to grow or grows at a slower rate than we anticipate our business will suffer   

our microinverter solution is utilized in solar photovoltaic or pv installations which provide onsite distributed power generation as a result our future success depends on continued demand for solar energy solutions and the ability of solar equipment vendors to meet this demand the solar industry is an evolving industry that has experienced substantial changes in recent years   and we cannot be certain that consumers and businesses will adopt solar pv systems as an alternative energy source at levels sufficient to grow our business traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility for alternative methods of distributed power to succeed businesses and consumers must adopt new purchasing practices the viability and continued growth in demand for solar energy solutions and in turn our products may be impacted by many factors outside of our control including 

   

 8 

 if demand for solar energy solutions fails to develop sufficiently demand for our customers products as well as demand for our products will decrease which would have an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business 

shortterm demand and supply imbalances especially for solar module technology recently have caused prices for solar technology solutions to decline rapidly furthermore competition in the solar industry has increased due to the emergence of asian manufacturers along the entire solar value chain causing further price declines excess inventory and oversupply these market disruptions may continue to occur and may increase pressure to reduce prices which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for solar pv systems and harm our business   

the market for ongrid applications where solar power is used to supplement a customers electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff depends in large part on the availability and size of government and economic incentives that vary by geographic market because our customers sales are typically into the ongrid market the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of electricity and could harm or halt the growth of the solar electricity industry and our business 

in general the cost of solar power currently exceeds retail electricity rates and we believe this tendency will continue in the near term as a result national state and local government bodies in many countries most notably canada france belgium germany italy japan the peoples republic of china the united kingdom spain and the united states have provided incentives in the form of feedin tariffs or fits rebates tax credits and other incentives to system owners distributors system integrators and manufacturers of solar pv systems to promote the use of solar electricity in ongrid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy many of these government incentives expire phase out over time terminate upon the exhaustion of the allocated funding require renewal by the applicable authority or are being amended by governments due to changing market circumstances or changes to national state or local energy policy 

to date we have generated substantially all of our revenues from north america and expect to generate a substantial amount of revenues from north america in the future there are a number of important incentives that are expected to phaseout or terminate in the future which could adversely affect sales of our products a substantial majority of our revenues come from the united states which has both federal and state incentives the renewable energy and job creation act of 2008 provides a 30 federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 as amended created a renewable energy grant program that offered cash payments in lieu of investment tax credits to renewable energy project developers for eligible property placed in service prior to december 31 2011 or placed in service by the specified credit termination date if construction began prior to december 31 2011 the guidelines include a “safe harbor” provision setting the beginning of construction at the point where the applicant has incurred or paid at least 5 of the total cost of the property excluding land and certain preliminary planning activities we believe the december 31 2011 deadline associated with this program had a positive effect on our sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 as customers and installers took actions to begin construction or place eligible property into service before the deadline and in 2012 as deferred revenues recorded in connection with these sales were recognized however unless this program is further extended the eventual phaseout of this program could adversely affect sales of our products in the future 

california is the largest single solar market in the united states based on analysis from seia data and gtm research and a significant portion of our revenues are generated in california in 2007 the state of california launched its 10year 3 billion “go solar california” campaign which encourages the installation of an aggregate of 3000 mw of solar energy systems in homes and businesses by the end of 2016 the largest part of the campaign the “california solar initiative” provides rebates and performancebased incentives which decrease in intervals as installation thresholds are met the “go solar california” program is scheduled to expire on december 31 2016 but if the pace of installations is high the program may conclude sooner 

  

we also sell our products in ontario canada the ontario power authority green energy and green economy act of 2009 created two separate fit programs for projects greater than 10kw and for projects less than 10kw these fit programs 

provide participants with a fixed price for electricity produced over a 20year contract term both programs were recently suspended while they underwent a review the program for projects less than 10kw was reopened to new applications in july 2012 and the program for projects between 10kw and 500kw was reopened for new applications on december 14 2012 the government of ontario has the authority to change the fits for future contracts at its discretion and has the authority to modify suspend or discontinue the program at any time suspension of the fit program in ontario directly impacted and could continue to impact our business furthermore any future suspension or modification of the program could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we began selling our products in france italy and the benelux region during the second quarter of 2012 we opened a sales office in the united kingdom and began selling our products there at the beginning of the third quarter a number of european countries including germany italy belgium and the united kingdom have adopted reductions to their fits and spain announced a suspension of its fit for new renewable energy projects in january 2012 these and related developments have significantly impacted the solar industry in europe and may adversely affect the future demand for the solar energy solutions in europe the reductions in european tariffs and subsidies and other requirements or incentives including local content requirements or incentives may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to do increased business in europe additionally as we further expand to other countries changes in incentive programs or electricity policies could negatively affect returns on our investments in those countries as well as our business financial condition and results of operations 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from other nonsolar renewable sources of electricity may successfully lobby for changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that are harmful to the solar industry reductions in or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives could result in decreased demand for and lower revenue from solar pv systems which would adversely affect sales of our products in addition our ability to successfully penetrate new geographic markets may depend on new countries adopting and maintaining incentives to promote solar electricity to the extent such incentives are not currently in place 

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including sovereign debt issues pose risks for our business   

the threat of continuing global economic capital markets and credit disruptions including the sovereign debt issues in europe pose risks for our business these risks include slower economic activity and investment in projects that make use of our products and services these economic developments particularly decreased credit availability have reduced demand for solar products the european sovereign debt crisis has caused and may continue to cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these conditions including reduced incentives continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations as we seek to do increased business in europe 

our microinverter systems may not achieve broader market acceptance which would prevent us from increasing our revenue and market share   

if we fail to achieve broad market acceptance of our products there would be an adverse impact on our ability to increase our revenue gain market share and achieve and sustain profitability our ability to achieve broad market acceptance for our products will be impacted by a number of factors including 

 10 

   

in addition our ability to achieve increased market share will depend on our ability to increase sales to established solar installers who have traditionally sold central inverters these installers often have made substantial investments in design installation resources and training in traditional central inverter systems which may create challenges for us to achieve their adoption of our microinverter solution 

our gross profit may fluctuate over time which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability   

our gross profit has varied in the past and is likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period our gross profit may be adversely affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control including 

 fluctuations in gross profit may adversely affect our ability to manage our business or achieve or maintain profitability 

the inverter industry is highly competitive and we expect to face increased competition as new and existing competitors introduce microinverter products which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share   

to date we have competed primarily against central inverter manufacturers and until recently have faced little direct competition in selling our microinverter systems marketing and selling our microinverter solutions against traditional inverter solutions is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify as new and existing competitors enter the microinverter market we believe that a number of companies have developed or are developing microinverters and other products that will compete directly with our microinverter systems sma solar technology ag powerone inc and sunpower corp leading inverter vendors serving the residential and commercial inverter markets have recently introduced or announced plans to introduce microinverter products in 2013 in addition several new entrants to the microinverter market have recently announced plans to ship or have already shipped products including some of our oem customers and partners 

currently competitors in the inverter market range from large companies such as sma solar technology ag fronius international gmbh and powerone inc to emerging companies offering alternative microinverter or other solar electronics products some of our competitors have announced plans to introduce microinverter products that could compete with our microinverter systems several of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger have greater financial marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for these products and technologies further certain competitors may be able to develop new products more quickly than we can and may be able to develop products that are more reliable or that provide more functionality than ours in addition some of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive or belowmarket pricing levels which could cause us to lose sales or market share or require us to lower prices for our microinverter systems in order to compete effectively suppliers of solar products particularly solar modules have experienced eroding prices over the last several years and as a result many have faced margin compression and declining revenues if we have to reduce our prices by more than we anticipated or if we are unable to offset any future reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volume reducing our costs and expenses or introducing new products our revenues and gross profit would suffer 

we also may face competition from some of our customers who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally for instance solar module manufacturers could attempt to develop components that directly perform dc to ac conversion in the module itself due to the fact that such customers may not seek to make a profit directly from the manufacture of these products they may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge such customers as a result these customers may purchase fewer of our microinverter systems or sell products that compete with our microinverters systems which would negatively impact our revenue and gross profit 

if we are unable to effectively manage our growth our business and operating results may suffer   

we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience significant growth in our sales and operations our historical growth has placed and planned future growth is expected to continue to place significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources to 

 we cannot assure you that our current and planned operations personnel systems internal procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation business or prospects 

our recent and planned expansion into new markets could subject us to additional business financial and competitive risks   

we currently offer microinverter systems targeting the residential and commercial markets in the us canada france italy the united kingdom the benelux region certain other select european markets and australia we also intend to expand into other international markets and to introduce new microinverter systems targeted at larger commercial and utilityscale installations our success in these new geographic and product markets will depend on a number of factors such as 

 12 

further new geographic markets and the larger commercial and utilityscale installation markets have different characteristics from the markets in which we currently sell products and our success will depend on our ability to properly address these differences these differences may include 

 failure to develop and introduce these new products successfully to generate sufficient revenue from these products to offset associated research and development marketing and manufacturing costs or to otherwise effectively anticipate and manage the risks and challenges associated with our potential expansion into new product and geographic markets could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 

a drop in the retail price of electricity derived from the utility grid or from alternative energy sources may harm our business financial condition and results of operations   

we believe that a system owners decision to purchase a solar pv system is strongly influenced by the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations relative to the retail price of electricity from the utility grid and the cost of other renewable energy sources including electricity from solar pv installations using central inverters decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the utility grid would make it more difficult for all solar pv systems to compete in particular growth in unconventional natural gas production and an increase in global liquefied natural gas capacity are expected to keep natural gas prices relatively low for the foreseeable future persistent low natural gas prices lower prices of electricity produced from other energy sources such as nuclear power or improvements to the utility infrastructure could reduce the retail price of electricity from the utility grid making the purchase of solar pv systems less economically attractive and lowering sales of our microinverter systems in addition energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce demand for electricity also could cause a fall in the retail price of electricity from the utility grid moreover technological developments by our competitors in the solar components industry including manufacturers of central inverters could allow these competitors or their partners to offer electricity at costs lower than those that can be achieved from solar pv installations based on our product platform which could result in reduced demand for our products if the cost of electricity generated by solar pv installations incorporating our microinverter systems is high relative to the cost of electricity from other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 

problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to continue to incur additional warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and cause our revenue and gross profit to decline   

we have offered 15year limited warranties for our first and second generation microinverters and offer a limited warranty of up to 25 years on our third generation microinverters our limited warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship of our microinverters under normal use and service conditions for up to 25 years following installation as a result we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold the product and recognized revenue our estimated costs of warranty for previously sold products may change to the extent future products are not compatible with earlier generation products under warranty 

while we offer warranties of up to 25 years our microinverters have only been in use since mid2008 when we first commenced commercial sales of our products although we conduct accelerated life cycle testing to measure performance and reliability our microinverter systems have not been tested over the full warranty cycle and do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life in addition under realworld operating conditions which may vary by location and design as well as insolation soiling and weather conditions a typical solar pv 

installation may perform in a different way than under standard test conditions if our products perform below expectations or have unexpected reliability problems we may be unable to gain or retain customers and could face substantial warranty expense 

because of the limited operating history of our products we have been required to make assumptions and apply judgments based on our accelerated life cycle testing regarding a number of factors including the durability and reliability of our products and our anticipated rate of warranty claims our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our products causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products in the future an increase in our estimates of future warranty obligations due to product failure rates field service obligations and rework costs incurred in correcting product failures have caused and could in the future cause us to increase the amount of warranty obligations and have had and may have in the future a corresponding negative impact on our results of operations 

we also depend significantly on our reputation for reliability and highquality products and services exceptional customer service and our brand name to attract new customers and grow our business if our products and services do not perform as anticipated or we experience unexpected reliability problems or widespread product failures our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired and we may lose or be unable to gain or retain customers 

if we do not forecast demand for our products accurately we may experience product shortages delays in product shipment excess product inventory or difficulties in planning expenses which will adversely affect our business and financial condition   

we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand this process requires us to make multiple forecasts and assumptions relating to the demand of our distributors their end customers and general market conditions because we sell most of our products to distributors who in turn sell to their end customers we have limited visibility as to endcustomer demand we depend significantly on our distributors to provide us visibility into their endcustomer demand and we use these forecasts to make our own forecasts and planning decisions if the information from our distributors turns out to be incorrect then our own forecasts may also be inaccurate furthermore we do not have longterm purchase commitments from our distributors or end customers and our sales are generally made by purchase orders that may be canceled changed or deferred without notice to us or penalty as a result it is difficult to forecast future customer demand to plan our operations 

if we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are canceled or shipments are delayed we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell we may have to make significant provisions for inventory writedowns based on events that are currently not known and such provisions or any adjustments to such provisions could be material conversely if we underestimate demand we may not have sufficient inventory to meet endcustomer demand and we may lose market share damage relationships with our distributors and end customers and forgo potential revenue opportunities obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible particularly in the short term and in light of our outsourced manufacturing processes which could prevent us from fulfilling orders in a timely and cost efficient manner or at all in addition if we overestimate our production requirements our contract manufacturers may purchase excess components and build excess inventory if our contract manufacturers at our request purchase excess components that are unique to our products and are unable to recoup the costs of such excess through resale or return or build excess products we could be required to pay for these excess parts or products and recognize related inventory writedowns 

in addition we plan our operating expenses including research and development expenses hiring needs and inventory investments in part on our estimates of customer demand and future revenue if customer demand or revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect we may not be able to proportionately reduce our fixed operating expenses for that period which would harm our operating results for that period 

we depend upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers our operations could be disrupted if we encounter problems with these contract manufacturers   

we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon a small number of contract manufacturers to build our products in particular we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of microinverter products cabling and our communications gateway related to our microinverter systems our reliance on a small number of contract manufacturers makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs we do not have longterm supply contracts with our other manufacturing partners consequently these manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any period in any specified quantity or at any certain price 

the revenues that our contract manufacturers generate from our orders represent a relatively small percentage of their overall revenues as a result fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event of constrained ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner in addition the facilities in which our microinverters related cabling and communications gateway products are manufactured are located outside of the united states we believe that the location of these facilities outside of the united states increases supply risk including the risk of supply interruptions or reductions in manufacturing quality or controls 

if any of our contract manufacturers were unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes and at high quality levels or renew existing terms under supply agreements we would have to identify qualify and select acceptable alternative contract manufacturers an alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms including price any significant interruption in manufacturing would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers which in turn would reduce our revenues harm our relationships with our customers and damage our relationships with our distributors and end customers and cause us to forgo potential revenue opportunities 

manufacturing problems could result in delays in product shipments to customers and could adversely affect our revenue competitive position and reputation   

we may experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations our product development manufacturing and testing processes are complex and require significant technological and production process expertise such processes involve a number of precise steps from design to production any change in our processes could cause one or more production errors requiring a temporary suspension or delay in our production line until the errors can be researched identified and properly addressed and rectified this may occur particularly as we introduce new products modify our engineering and production techniques and expand our capacity in addition our failure to maintain appropriate quality assurance processes could result in increased product failures loss of customers increased production costs and delays any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption could also occur in our manufacturing partners fabrication facility due to any number of reasons such as equipment failure contaminated materials or process deviations which could adversely impact manufacturing yields or delay product shipments as a result we could incur additional costs that would adversely affect our gross profit and product shipments to our customers could be delayed beyond the shipment schedules requested by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue competitive position and reputation 

additionally manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors including the stability and manufacturability of the product design manufacturing improvements gained over cumulative production volumes and the quality and consistency of component parts capacity constraints raw materials shortages logistics issues labor shortages changes in customer requirements manufacturing facilities or processes or those of some thirdparty contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components have historically caused and may in the future cause reduced manufacturing yields negatively impacting the gross profit on and our production capacity for those products moreover an increase in the rejection and rework rate of products during the quality control process before during or after manufacture would result in our experiencing lower yields gross profit and production capacity 

the risks of these types of manufacturing problems are further increased during the introduction of new product lines which has from time to time caused and may in the future cause temporary suspension of production lines while problems are addressed or corrected since our business is substantially dependent on a limited number of product lines any prolonged or substantial suspension of manufacturing production lines could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue gross profit competitive position and distributor and customer relationships 

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components and products if we are unable to source these components on a timely basis we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers   

we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components of our products for example our asics are purchased from a sole source supplier or developed for us by sole source suppliers any of the sole source and limited source suppliers upon whom we rely could experience quality and reliability issues could stop producing our components cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors we generally do not have longterm supply agreements with our suppliers and our purchase volumes are currently too low for us to be considered a priority customer by most of our suppliers as a result most of these suppliers could stop selling to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all any such quality or reliability issue or interruption or delay may force us to seek similar 

components or products from alternative sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms including price or at all switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and may potentially require us to requalify our products which would be costly and timeconsuming any interruption in the quality or supply of sole source or limited source components for our products would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers could result in lost revenue or higher expenses and would harm our business 

if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials in a timely manner or if the price of raw materials increases significantly production time and product costs could increase which may adversely affect our business   

the manufacturing and packaging processes used by our contract manufacturers depend on raw materials such as copper aluminum silicon and petroleumbased products from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors certain of our suppliers have the ability to pass along to us directly or through our contract manufacturers any increases in the price of raw materials if the prices of these raw materials rise significantly we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers while we may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to wide fluctuations in the cost of raw materials the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited due to all these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or at reasonable cost in addition from time to time we or our contract manufacturers may need to reject raw materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in potential delays or declines in output furthermore problems with our raw materials may give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims errors or defects may arise from raw materials supplied by third parties that are beyond our detection or control which could lead to additional customer returns or product warranty claims that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

if potential owners of solar pv systems based on our product platform are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms we could experience a reduction in the demand for our solar pv systems   

many owners of solar pv systems depend on financing to purchase their systems the limited use of microinverters to date coupled with our limited operating history could result in lenders refusing to provide the financing necessary to purchase solar pv systems based on our product platform on favorable terms or at all moreover in the case of debt financed projects even if lenders are willing to finance the purchase of these systems an increase in interest rates or a change in tax incentives could make it difficult for owners to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar pv system on favorable terms or at all in addition we believe that a significant percentage of owners purchase solar pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of upfront cash and financing difficulties in obtaining financing for solar pv installations on favorable terms or increases in interest rates or changes in tax incentives could lower an investors return on investment in a solar pv installation or make alternative solar pv systems or other investments more attractive relative to solar pv systems based on our product platform any of these events could result in reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition an increasing share of residential solar installations has been provided through third party financing structures such as power purchase or lease agreements our sales growth therefore increasingly depends on sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings who provide solar as a service via power purchase agreements or leasing structures the third party finance market for residential solar in the us and elsewhere is or may become highly concentrated with a few significant finance companies and several smaller entrants if we are unable develop relationships and gain a significant share of inverter sales to the major finance companies or new entrants our overall sales growth will be constrained 

we rely primarily on distributors to assist in selling our products and the failure of these distributors to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue   

we sell our microinverter systems primarily through distributors as well as through direct sales to solar equipment installers and sales to developers of third party solar finance offerings for 2012 focused energy inc and sunwize technologies inc each accounted for more than 10 of our net revenues and collectively both accounted for 27 of our total net revenues we do not have exclusive arrangements with these third parties and as a result many of our distributors also market and sell products from our competitors which may reduce our sales our distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time or with short notice our distributors may fail to devote resources necessary to sell our products at the prices in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect or may focus their marketing and sales efforts on products of our competitors our future performance depends on our ability to effectively manage our relationships with our existing distributors as well as to attract additional distributors that will be able to market and support our products effectively especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products termination of agreements with 

current distributors failure by these distributors to perform as expected or failure by us to cultivate new distributor relationships could hinder our ability to expand our operations and harm our revenue and operating results 

ordering patterns from our distributors may cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period   

our distributors place purchase orders with us based on their assessment of endcustomer demand and their forecasts because these forecasts may not be accurate channel inventory held at our distributors may fluctuate significantly due to the difference between their forecasts and actual demand as a result distributors adjust their purchase orders placed with us in response to changing channel inventory levels as well as their assessment of the latest market demand trends we have limited visibility into future end customer demand a significant decrease in our distributors channel inventory in one period may lead to a significant rebuilding of channel inventory in subsequent periods or vice versa which may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly this fluctuation may cause our results to fall short of analyst or investor expectations in a certain period which may cause our stock price to decline 

our success in an “ac module” version of our microinverter system may depend in part upon our ability to continue to work closely with leading solar module manufacturers   

we are currently working on a variant of our microinverter system that will enable an “ac module” for direct attachment of the microinverter to the solar modules the market success of such solutions will depend in part on our ability to continue to work closely with solar module manufacturers to design solar modules that are compatible with such direct attachment microinverter solutions we may not be able to encourage solar module manufacturers to work with us on the development of such compatible solutions combining our microinverter system and solar modules for a variety of reasons including differences in marketing or selling strategy competitive considerations lack of competitive pricing and technological compatibility in addition our ability to form effective partnerships with solar module manufacturers may be adversely affected by the substantial changes faced by many of these manufacturers due to declining prices and revenues from sales of solar modules 

if we fail to retain our key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer   

  

our future success and ability to implement our business strategy depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and on the continued contributions of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel each of whom would be difficult to replace all of our employees including our senior management are free to terminate their employment relationships with us at any time competition for highly skilled technical people is extremely intense and we face challenges identifying hiring and retaining qualified personnel in many areas of our business if we fail to retain our senior management and other key personnel or if we fail to attract additional qualified personnel we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business could suffer 

if we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property and other proprietary rights our business and results of operations could be materially harmed   

our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and unfair competition laws as well as confidentiality and license agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we have applied for patent and trademark registrations in the united states and in certain other countries some of which have been issued we cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved or that our existing and future intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology and any failure to obtain such approvals or finding that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable could force us to among other things rebrand or redesign our affected products in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or where effective intellectual property protection is not available to the same extent as in the united states we may be at greater risk that our proprietary rights will be misappropriated infringed or otherwise violated 

to protect our unregistered intellectual property including our trade secrets and knowhow we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants we also require other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information to enter into nondisclosure agreements such measures however provide only limited protection and we cannot assure that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our confidential information especially after our employees or third parties end their employment or engagement with us or provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of such disclosure furthermore competitors or other third parties may independently discover our trade 

secrets in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights copy or reverse engineer our products or portions thereof or develop similar technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed 

in the future we may need to take legal action to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel which could significantly harm our business in addition we may not prevail in such proceedings an adverse outcome of any such proceeding may reduce our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business 

third parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights which could divert managements attention cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the technology to which such rights relate   

our competitors and other third parties hold numerous patents related to technology used in our industry and claims of patent or other intellectual property right infringement or violation have been litigated against certain of our competitors from time to time we may also be subject to such claims and litigation regardless of their merit responding to such claims can be time consuming divert managements attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses while we believe that our products and technology do not infringe in any material respect upon any valid intellectual property rights of third parties we cannot be certain that we would be successful in defending against any such claims furthermore patent applications in the united states and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published so we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties patent rights or that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents or patent applications as we become more visible as a publicly traded company the possibility that third parties may make claims of intellectual property infringement or other violations against us may grow an adverse outcome with respect to any such claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and force us to do one or more of the following 

 any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time 

our failure to obtain the right to use necessary thirdparty intellectual property rights on reasonable terms or our failure to maintain and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to these rights could harm our business and prospects 

from time to time we have licensed and in the future we may choose to or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products we cannot assure that such licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all and our inability to obtain such licenses could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or of greater cost in addition we incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin functionality or other features of the software some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available for limited fees or at no cost although we monitor our use of open source software open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software we may be required to release our proprietary source code reengineer our software discontinue the sale of certain products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action furthermore if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses from third parties or fail to comply with applicable open source licenses we may be subject to costly third party claims of intellectual property infringement or ownership of our proprietary source code any of the foregoing could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage 

defects and poor performance in our products could result in loss of customers decreased revenue and unexpected expenses and we may face warranty indemnity and product liability claims arising from defective products 

our products must meet stringent quality requirements and may contain undetected errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new generations are released errors defects or poor performance can arise due to design flaws defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product these errors or defects may be dangerous as defective power components may cause power overloads potentially resulting in explosion or fire as we develop new generations of our products and enter new markets we face higher risk of undetected defects because our testing protocols may not be able to fully test the products under all possible operating conditions in the past we have experienced defects in our products due to certain errors in the manufacturing and design process any actual or perceived errors defects or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products shipment delays rejection of our products damage to our reputation lost revenue diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts in order to address or remedy any defects and increases in customer service and support costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

furthermore defective inefficient or poorly performing power components may give rise to warranty indemnity or product liability claims against us that exceed any revenue or profit we receive from the affected products we could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us we currently maintain a moderate level of product liability insurance and there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim also we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain this coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that a product liability claim would not harm our business or financial condition costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty and product liability claims or product recalls may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our enlighten webbased monitoring service which our customers use to track and monitor the performance of their solar pv systems based on our product platform may contain undetected errors failures or bugs especially when new versions or enhancements are released we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future any errors defects disruptions in service or other performance problems with our monitoring service could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles 

we have been and could continue to be subject to industryspecific seasonal fluctuations in the future particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months such as northern europe canada and the united states in general we expect our product revenue in the third and fourth quarters to be positively affected by seasonal customer demand trends including solar economic incentives weather patterns and construction cycles in the united states customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons in addition construction levels are typically slower in colder months in european countries with fits the construction of solar pv systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year largely due to the annual reduction of the applicable minimum fit and the fact that the coldest winter months are january through march accordingly our business and quarterly results of operations could be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the future 

covenants in our credit facilities may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities and competitive developments and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

we have lending arrangements with several financial institutions including loan and security agreements with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” and with hercules technology growth capital inc “hercules” the loan and security agreements with wells fargo and with hercules restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt encumbering our tangible or intangible property paying dividends or engaging in certain transactions such as mergers and acquisitions investments and asset sales our loan and security agreement with wells fargo also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including liquidity ratios while our agreement with hercules includes a condition precedent to borrowing that is subject to us achieving certain financial objectives these restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions in addition our obligations under our loan and security agreements with wells fargo and hercules are secured by substantially all of our assets excluding intellectual property which limits our ability to provide collateral for additional financing a breach of any of these covenants or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of our indebtedness and the forfeiture of our assets subject to security interests in favor of the lenders 

we are an “emerging growth company” and may elect to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which could make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act and for as long as we continue to be an “emerging growth company” we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we could be an “emerging growth company” until december 31 2017 the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering although we could cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier if certain events occur as specified in the jobs act such as our achieving annual revenue of at least 1 billion or our becoming a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule 12b2 of the exchange act we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or are unable to remediate any deficiencies in our internal controls we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud in that case our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud in addition section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2013 in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our first annual report on 10k for the year in which we cease to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act enacted in april 2012 or the jobs act the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section 404 will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of management we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future even if we conclude and our independent registered public accounting firm concurs that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price in addition a delay in compliance with section 404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions including sec action ineligibility for short form resale registration the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the stock exchange on which it is listed and the inability of registered brokerdealers to make a market in our common stock which would further reduce our stock price and could harm our business 

our ability to use net operating losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the internal revenue code and may be subject to further limitation as a result of future transactions 

sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change which is generally any cumulative change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear period to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in the years after the ownership change these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders who directly or indirectly own 5 or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company generally if an ownership change occurs the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change as a result we may be unable to offset our taxable income with net operating losses or our tax liability with credits before these losses and credits expire 

in addition it is possible that future transactions including issuances of new shares of our common stock and sales of shares of our common stock will cause us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes in that event we generally would not be able to use our net operating losses from periods prior to this ownership change to offset future taxable income 

in excess of the annual limitations imposed by sections 382 and 383 and those attributes that are already subject to limitations as a result of our prior ownership changes may be subject to more stringent limitations 

  

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert managements attention from other aspects of our business 

we are subject to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act the sarbanesoxley act and the rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market impose significant regulatory requirements on public companies including specific corporate governance practices for example the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors audit and compensation committees distribution of annual and interim reports stockholder meetings stockholder approvals solicitation of proxies conflicts of interest stockholder voting rights and codes of conduct our management and other personnel are required to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly as a public company being subject to these rules and regulations makes it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and in the future we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial additional costs to maintain the same or similar coverage these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as executive officers 

these rules and regulations also contain requirements that apply to manufacturers of products incorporating specified minerals the doddfrank act requires public companies to report on their use of socalled conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or its nine immediate neighbors certain minerals commonly used in semiconductors are on the list of conflict minerals and additional minerals may be added to the list in the future compliance with these rules which will require us to disclose our use of these minerals and to obtain an annual audit of our sourcing and the chain of custody of these minerals will be timeconsuming and costly 

we may not be able to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business opportunities on favorable terms if at all or without dilution to our stockholders 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents available credit facilities and cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months however we may need to raise additional capital to execute on our current or future business strategies including to 

 we do not know what forms of financing if any will be available to us if financing is not available on acceptable terms if and when needed our ability to fund our operations expand our research and development sales and marketing functions develop and enhance our products respond to unanticipated events including unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited in any such event our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and we may be unable to continue our operations moreover if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and these newly issued securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 

natural disasters terrorist or cyber attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 

our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses for example our corporate headquarters in petaluma california is located near major earthquake fault lines further a terrorist attack including one aimed at energy or communications infrastructure suppliers or our webbased monitoring service could hinder or delay the development and sale or performance of our products in the event that an earthquake tsunami typhoon terrorist or cyber attack or other natural manmade or technical catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturer destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations or services for any extended period of time our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations or new interpretations thereof by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

changes in current laws or regulations applicable to us or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or other jurisdictions in which we do business such as canada france italy the united kingdom the benelux region and china could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in our products or changes in export and import laws and implementing regulations may create delays in the introduction of new products in international markets prevent our customers from deploying our products internationally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 

for example the italian energy authority aeeg recently enacted a new set of interconnection standards for solar energy installations which took effect in july 2012 we are currently developing a solution to meet these requirements however in the event that we cannot implement our intended solution in the near term the total market available for our microinverter products in italy and our business as a result may be adversely impacted 

while we are not aware of any other current or proposed export or import regulations which would materially restrict our ability to sell our products in countries such as canada france italy the united kingdom the benelux region or china any change in export or import regulations or related legislation shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations in such event our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance 

the market price of our common stock has been and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this section of this annual report on form 10k and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may become the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors which may lead to volatility in our stock price 

our quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter this variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations these fluctuations are due to numerous factors including 

 22 

 the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these as well as other factors could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of this revenue shortfall on our results of operations moreover our results of operations may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks 

if research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business the price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business if one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our common stock could decrease which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

our principal stockholders executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock and they may take actions that our stockholders may not view as beneficial 

as of february 28 2013  our executive officers directors greater than 5 stockholders and entities that are affiliated with them beneficially owned approximately 47 of our outstanding common stock this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders also as a result these stockholders acting together may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets consequently this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control including a merger consolidation or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control even if this change in control would benefit our other stockholders 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock as of february 28 2013  we had approximately 412 million shares of common stock outstanding all of which are eligible for sale in the public market subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule 144 under the securities act sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and consequently your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 

we currently do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition the terms of our bank loan agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends consequently an investors only opportunity to achieve a return on its investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the investor sells its shares at a profit 

our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporate law may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time 

these provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

forwardlooking statements 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties in some cases you can identify forwardlooking statements by terminology such as “may” “will” “should” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “predict” “intend” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology for example statements regarding our expectations as to future financial performance expense levels and liquidity sources are forwardlooking statements our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report 

overview 

we deliver microinverter technology for the solar industry that increases energy production simplifies design and installation improves system uptime and reliability reduces fire safety risk and provides a platform for intelligent energy management we were founded in march 2006 and have grown rapidly to become the market leader in the microinverter category since our first commercial shipment in mid2008 we have sold over 3000000 microinverters as of december 31 2012 our products are certified for installation in the united states canada france the united kingdom italy and the benelux region 

we sell our microinverter systems primarily to distributors who resell them to solar installers we also sell directly to large installers and through original equipment manufacturers “oems” and strategic partners us net revenues have historically comprised more than 85 of our business with the remainder from canada and europe 

we have experienced significant revenue growth since our first commercial shipment in mid2008 our net revenues were  2167 million  1495 million  and 617 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively which reflects deeper market penetration and broader acceptance of microinverter technology we incurred net losses of 382 million  323 million  and 218 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively as we invested significant resources to develop new product offerings and focused on critical research and development activities required to reduce product costs increase performance and foster innovation we also expanded our operations into new product markets and geographies and invested in our operational infrastructure to support anticipated growth 

 our fulltime employee headcount has grown from 153 at december 31 2010 to 298 at december 31 2011 and to 384 at december 31 2012 we do not expect similar growth rates in headcount in the near term we believe the investments we have made in our corporate infrastructure will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases in research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

components of consolidated statements of operations 

net revenues 

we generate net revenues from sales of our microinverter systems which include microinverter units an envoy communications gateway device and our enlighten webbased monitoring service we sell to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners 

our revenue is affected by changes in the volume and average selling prices of our microinverter systems driven by supply and demand sales incentives and competitive product offerings our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to market our products in a manner that increases awareness for microinverter technology the continual development and introduction of new products to meet the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers and the diversification and expansion of our revenue base

cost of revenues is comprised primarily of product costs warranty manufacturing personnel and logistics costs depreciation and amortization of test equipment and hosting services costs our product costs are impacted by technological innovations such as advances in semiconductor integration and new product introductions economies of scale resulting in lower component costs and improvements in production processes and automation certain costs primarily personnel and depreciation and amortization of test equipment are not directly affected by sales volume 

we outsource our manufacturing to thirdparty contract manufacturers and generally negotiate product pricing with them on a quarterly basis in addition a contract manufacturer also serves as our logistics provider by warehousing and delivering our products in north america and europe we believe our contract manufacturing partners have sufficient production capacity to meet the growing demand for our products for the foreseeable future however shortages in the supply of certain key raw materials could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products 

gross profit may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our average selling prices product cost product mix warranty costs and sales volume fluctuations resulting from seasonality 

operating expenses 

operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnelrelated costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories and include salaries benefits payroll taxes recruiting costs sales commissions and stockbased compensation we believe the investments we have made in our corporate infrastructure will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases in research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 

research and development expense includes personnelrelated expenses such as salaries stockbased compensation and employee benefits research and development employees are engaged in the design and development of power electronics semiconductors powerline communications and networking and software functionality research and development expense also includes thirdparty design and development costs testing and evaluation costs depreciation expense and other indirect costs we devote substantial resources in ongoing research and development programs that focus on enhancements to and cost efficiencies in our existing products and timely development of new products that utilize technological innovation to drive down product costs and enhance reliability we intend to continue to invest substantial resources in our research and development efforts because we believe they are critical to maintaining our competitive position 

sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnelrelated expenses such as salaries commissions stockbased compensation employee benefits and travel it also includes trade shows marketing customer support and other indirect costs we expect to continue to make the necessary investments to enable us to execute our strategy to increase our market penetration geographically and into new markets by expanding our customer base of distributors large installers oems and strategic partners historically substantially all of our sales have been in the united states and canada we began selling into france italy and the benelux region in the fourth quarter of 2011 and commenced volume shipments to such regions in the second quarter of 2012 in addition we opened a sales office in the united kingdom during the second quarter of 2012 and began shipping products to the united kingdom in the third quarter of 2012 we believe the investments we have made in sales and marketing to date will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases from current levels of sales and marketing expenses however we expect to continue to expand the geographic reach of our product offerings and explore new sales channels in addressable markets in the future 

  

general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries stockbased compensation and employee benefits for personnel related to our executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations general and administrative expense also includes facilities costs and fees for professional services professional services consist primarily of outside legal accounting and information technology consulting costs we believe the investments we have made in our corporate infrastructure to date will enable us to deliver higher levels of net revenues without proportionate increases from current levels of general and administrative expenses 

other income expense net 

other income expense net includes interest income on invested cash balances and interest expense on amounts outstanding under our credit and convertible note facilities and noncash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs other income expense net also includes marktomarket adjustments to record our preferred stock warrants at fair value prior to our initial public offering of our common stock or ipo which were issued in conjunction with credit facilities as well as losses or gains on conversion of nonus dollar transactions into us dollars and foreign currency forward contracts 

provision for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products historically we have primarily been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold the vast majority of our products to customers in the united states as we have expanded the sale of products to customers outside the united states we have become subject to taxation 

based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place as sales in foreign jurisdictions increase in the future our effective tax rate may fluctuate accordingly we have not recorded any us federal or state income tax provision for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception in 2012 a provision for income taxes of 07 million has been recognized related to our foreign operations due to the history of losses we have generated since inception we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets

net revenues 

  



  

2012 compared to 2011   net revenues increased by 45  to 2167 million  in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the increase in the overall volume of our products shipped the number of microinverter units sold increased by 51  from approximately 1002000  units in 2011 to approximately 1510000  units in 2012 the overall increase in units sold was attributable primarily to sales of our third generation microinverter which was introduced during the second quarter of 2011 in addition the increase in unit sales was driven by deeper penetration of our existing customer base the addition of new customers and broader acceptance of our products resulting from among other factors investments made in sales and marketing during 2012 we continued to experience a modest decline in the average selling price of our microinverters the decline in average selling price reflects and is consistent with recent trends in the solar industry 

  

2011 compared to 2010  net revenues increased by 142  to 1495 million  in 2011 compared to 2010  the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the increase in the overall volume of our products shipped the number of microinverter units sold increased by 142  from approximately 414000  units in 2010 to approximately 1002000  units in 2011 the overall increase in units sold was attributable primarily to sales of our third generation microinverter which was introduced during the second quarter of 2011 in addition the increase in unit sales was driven by deeper penetration of our existing customer base the addition of new customers and broader acceptance of our products resulting from among other factors investments made in sales and marketing 

  

cost of revenues and gross margin 

  



  

2012 compared to 2011  cost of revenues increased by 34  in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of microinverter units sold to customers consistent with the overall increase in net revenues as described above gross profit increased by 90  in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to increased revenue gross margin increased by 6 percentage points to 255  in 2012 as compared to 194 in 2011 the increase was primarily driven by a 8 percentage point increase from a larger mix of our highermargin third generation microinverter which has a lower per unit manufacturing cost than our second generation microinverter the lower per unit cost was achieved primarily through design enhancements which resulted in a higher level of semiconductor integration and improved efficiencies on increased production volume in addition gross margin improved by 2 percentage points in 2012 as a result of a reduction in usage of expedited airfreight for finished goods due to improvements in delivery scheduling these increases were partially offset by a 4 percentage point reduction to gross margin due to a net increase in warranty expense primarily attributable to changes in estimates to warranty obligations associated with our previous generation products 

  

2011 compared to 2010  cost of revenues increased by 118  in 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of microinverter units sold to customers consistent with the overall increase in net revenues as described above gross profit increased by 347  in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to increased revenue gross margin increased by 9 percentage points to 194  in 2011 compared to 105  in 2010 substantially all of this increase in gross margin was driven by sales of our highermargin third generation microinverter which became available in june 2011and has a lower per unit manufacturing cost than our second generation microinverter the increase in gross margin was partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase in usage of expedited airfreight for finished goods and an 1 percentage point increase in warranty expense 

  

research and development 

  



  

2012 compared to 2011  research and development expenses increased by 105 million  in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a 78 million increase in personnelrelated costs as a result of increases in research and development headcount the increase in headcount reflects our continuing investment in enhancements of existing products as well as efforts to bring new products to market in addition the use of outside services for the development of new products and depreciation and amortization related to research and development equipment increased by 16 million and 10 million respectively as compared to the prior year period 

  

2011 compared to 2010  research and development expenses increased by 108 million  in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to a 71 million increase in personnelrelated costs as a result of increases in research and development headcount the increase in headcount reflects our continuing investment in enhancements of existing products as well as efforts to bring new products to market including our third generation microinverter in addition depreciation and amortization related to research and development equipment and the use of outside services for the development of new products increased by 22 million and 14 million respectively as compared to the prior year period

other income expense net 

  



  

2012 compared to 2011  other expense increased by 28 million  in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase was attributable to a 34 million increase in interest expense from writeoffs of deferred financing costs and debt discount as a result of the early extinguishment of convertible debt and term loans and the termination of a revolving line of credit in addition foreign currency losses contributed 04 million to the increase the increases were partially offset by a 08 million decrease in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant prior to the liability being reclassified as equity upon our ipo 

2011 compared to 2010  other expense increased by 25 million  in 2011 as compared to 2010 this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher debt balances and noncash interest charges noncash interest charges totaled 18 million and 01 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively and consisted of amortization of debt discounts as well as paidinkind interest on our convertible notes 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

prior to our ipo in april 2012 we funded our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes and proceeds from term loans on april 4 2012 we completed our ipo in which we issued and sold 10315151 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately 538 million as of december 31 2012  we had 453 million  in cash and cash equivalents which are held primarily in bank deposits and money market accounts and 611 million  in working capital the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 

  



  

net cash used in operating activities 

  

we have experienced negative operating cash flows as we invested significant resources to develop new product offerings and focused on critical research and development activities required to reduce product costs increase performance and foster innovation in addition we used cash to expand our operations into new product markets and geographies and invested in our operational infrastructure to support the growth of our business 

for 2012 net cash used in operating activities was 446 million  primarily resulting from a net loss of 382 million  the net loss was partially offset by noncash items including depreciation and amortization of 56 million  stockbased compensation of 48 million  and interest expense of 48 million  in addition the effect of changes in net operating assets and liabilities resulted in the use of cash totaling 222 million  

the primary use of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities was attributable to an 186 million  decrease in deferred revenues which was primarily due to shipments of products during 2012 for which upfront payments of 230 million were received from customers in december 2011 as discussed below in addition other uses of cash from changes in net operating assets and liabilities included an 110 million  increase in accounts receivable and an 86 million  increase in inventoryrelated purchases both consistent with the overall growth of our business in 2012 as compared to 2011 offsetting these uses of cash was an increase in accounts payable of 168 million  which was also driven by the growth of our business 

for 2011 notwithstanding a net loss of 323 million  net cash used in operating activities approximated breakeven primarily due to a 254 million increase in deferred revenues in december 2011 we entered into several agreements to sell microinverters to customers with product delivery in 2012 these agreements were due in part to the anticipated expiration of certain government incentives for investments in renewable energy projects on december 31 2011 prior to december 31 2011 we received 294 million in cash in advance from these customers of which 64 million and 230 million were recorded as revenues and deferred revenues respectively our net loss included noncash charges in the form of depreciation and amortization of 30 million stockbased compensation of 21 million and noncash interest expense of 18 million related to the amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs changes in working capital items other than deferred revenues used 10 million of operating cash flow and consisted of increases in accounts receivable inventory and prepaid and other assets offset by increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 

for 2010 net cash used in operating activities was 179 million  primarily resulting from a net loss of 218 million  offset by the effect of noncash expenses of 16 million  associated with depreciation and amortization and 08 million  in stockbased compensation additionally the primary source of cash from changes in our net operating assets and liabilities was attributable to a 14 million  increase in deferred revenues 

net cash used in investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to capital expenditures to support our growth 

  

for 2012 net cash used in investing activities of 130 million  included purchases of manufacturing test equipment and expenditures on leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in connection with our relocation to a new headquarter facility 

  

for 2011 net cash used in investing activities of 147 million  included purchases of manufacturing test equipment and 

the development of software for internal use

net cash provided by financing activities 

  

for 2012 net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds of 564 million received from our ipo after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs paid during 2012 cash used in financing activities consisted of 141 million  in principal repayments of term loans and 10 million  in financing costs associated with entering into new credit facilities in november 2012 this was partially offset by 100 million  in proceeds from term loan borrowings 

  

for 2011 net cash provided by financing activities consisted of 197 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible notes 93 million in net proceeds from an equipment financing facility and term loans and 19 million from the sale of common stock partially offset by 26 million in direct costs incurred in connection with the preparation of our registration statement and 20 million related to payments on our term loans and capital lease obligations

operating and capital expenditure requirements 

  

our future capital requirements may vary materially in the future and will depend on many factors including but not limited to our rate of revenue growth the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and other costs necessary to support our strategy 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents of 453 million  as of december 31 2012  together with borrowings expected to be available under our revolver with wells fargo and credit facility with hercules will be adequate to fund our debt obligations as well as our planned capital expenditures and operations over the next 12 months 

if additional sources of liquidity were needed we may consider new debt or equity offerings but there is no assurance that such transactions could be consummated on acceptable terms or at all failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 

  





 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

since our inception we have not engaged in any offbalance sheet arrangements including the use of structured finance special purpose entities or variable interest entities 

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap note 2 to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected 

we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and if it entails significant judgment subjectivity and complexity on the part of management in its application we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

  

we generate revenue from sales of its microinverter systems which include microinverter units and related accessories an envoy communications gateway device and an enlighten webbased monitoring service to distributors large installers oems and strategic partners enlighten service revenue represented less than 1  of our total revenues for all periods presented 

  

revenues from sales of microinverters and related accessories and communication gateways are recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery of the products has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement and title of and risk of loss have passed to the customer iii the sale price is fixed or determinable and 

iv collection is reasonably assured provisions for rebates sales incentives and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 

prior to june 2011 we sold envoy communications gateway devices and our enlighten webbased monitoring service separately beginning in june 2011 each sale of an envoy communications gateway device includes the enlighten webbased monitoring service the allocation of revenue between the two deliverables is based on the best estimate of selling price determined by considering multiple factors including internal costs gross margin and historical pricing practices after allocating the overall consideration from such sale to each deliverable using the best estimate of the selling price i revenue from the sale of envoy devices is recognized upon shipment assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met and ii revenue from the webbased monitoring service is recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the related envoy devices of 10 years 

  

inventory valuation 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a firstin firstout basis certain factors could affect the realizable value of our inventories including market and economic conditions technological changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction we consider historic usage expected demand anticipated sales price effect of new product introductions product obsolescence customer concentrations product merchantability and other factors when evaluating the value of inventories inventory writedowns are equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated fair market value during 2012 2011 and 2010 we recorded writedowns of inventories of 08 million  27 million  and 01 million  respectively 

  

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to record inventory at the lower of cost or market however if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

  

warranty obligations 

  

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for our microinverters the warranty obligation is generally in the form of product replacement the first and second generation microinverters sold through the third quarter of 2012 include a 15year limited warranty period the third generation microinverters sold since the second quarter of 2011 provide for up to a 25year limited warranty period 

estimated warranty costs are included in cost of revenues and are accrued at the time of sale on a per unit sold basis such estimates are based on various factors including assumptions for each generation of microinverters about the frequency of product failures future warranty claim rates and replacement costs as follows 

 the calculation of estimated warranty obligations requires management to make significant assumptions since we have only been producing microinverters for a relatively short period the calculation of warranty obligations is inherently uncertain if actual experience related to product failure rates claim rates or cost to replace differs materially from our estimates we may be required to revise those estimates resulting in adjustments to our financial results in the period during which such changes in estimates are made such adjustments could materially adversely affect our gross profit and operating results changes in estimates related to warranty obligations resulted in net increases in warranty expense of 76 million  18 million and 0 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively see note 5 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  concentrations of credit risk and major customers 

  

we are potentially subject to financial instrument concentration of credit risk through our cash equivalents and trade accounts receivables we place our cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions that management assesses to be of high credit quality to limit the exposure of each investment trade accounts receivables can be potentially exposed to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers as of december 31 2012  we had amounts due from two  customers that represented 21  and 16  of the total accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2011  our two  largest accounts receivable balances represented 24  and 10  of the total accounts receivable balance in 2012  two  customers accounted for 16  and 11  of total net revenues in 2011  three  customers accounted for 17  11  and 10  of total net revenues in 2010  two  customers accounted for 14  and 11  of total net revenues 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we operate and conduct business in foreign countries where our foreign entities use the local currency as their respective functional currency and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates more specifically we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in euros british pounds and new zealand dollars these payables and receivables primarily arise from sales to customers and intercompany transactions we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our european and new zealand operations including sales and marketing and research and development expenses to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period 

in june 2012 we began to utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to anticipated cash receipts from expected future revenues denominated in euros and intercompany transaction gains or losses the contracts we enter into typically have maturities of less than one year we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the foreign currency forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in other income expense net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations 

a summary of our open foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2012  is as follows all open contracts are obligations for the company to deliver the foreign currency in thousands 

  



the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our forward currency exchange contracts is limited as the exposure is substantially offset by exchange rate changes of the underlying hedged amounts a hypothetical 10 strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar at december 31 2012 would have decreased the fair value of our open contracts by 06 million
