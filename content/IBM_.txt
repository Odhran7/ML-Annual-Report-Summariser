 item 1a risk factors

risks related to our business 

downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company’s business if overall demand for ibm’s products and solutions decreases whether due to general economic conditions including those associated with the covid19 pandemic or a shift in client buying patterns the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted

failure of innovation initiatives could impact the longterm success of the company ibm has been moving into areas including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud artificial intelligence quantum and other disruptive technologies in which it can differentiate itself through responsible innovation by leveraging its investments in rd and attracting a successful developer ecosystem if ibm is unable to continue its cuttingedge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins

damage to ibm’s reputation could impact the company’s business ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and ai leader 

ibm’s reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients product defects internal control deficiencies delivery failures cybersecurity incidents government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners or joint venture partners if the company’s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions its ability to attract and retain customers talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted

risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company’s business the company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the highvalue highly competitive and rapidlygrowing segments additionally emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services if the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences competitive actions disruptive technologies emerging business models and ecosystems the client demand for our products or services may decline or ibm’s costs may increase

ibm’s intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses the company’s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company’s nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company’s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company’s technology in addition the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties including nonpracticing entities also there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property including the ownership and protection of patents

certain of the company’s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other thirdparty software licensed with limited or no warranties indemnification or other contractual protections for ibm further if open source code that ibm utilizes is no longer maintained developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers most of whom we do not employ we may be unable to develop new technologies adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation quality and price 

risks to the company from acquisitions alliances and dispositions include integration challenges failure to achieve objectives the assumption of liabilities and higher debt levels the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions alliances and dispositions such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions as well as the failure to close planned transactions such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on ibm’s ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms from time to time the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company’s control

the company’s financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict ibm’s revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases in addition certain of the company’s growth areas involve new products new customers new and evolving competitors and new markets all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results the company’s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers’ businesses for example certain of the company’s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes further general economic conditions 

including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the covid19 pandemic may impact the company’s financial results in any particular period as a result of the abovementioned factors the company’s financial results are difficult to predict historically the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter in addition the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter especially at the end of the fourth quarter make financial results for a given period difficult to predict

due to the company’s global presence its business and operations could be impacted by local legal economic political health and other conditions including the covid19 pandemic the company is a globally integrated entity operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies could affect the company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations further the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the us and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry the company’s results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries further as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings both within the us and globally it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks including compliance with us and foreign data privacy requirements data localization requirements labor relations laws enforcement of ip protection laws laws relating to anticorruption anticompetition regulations and import export and trade restrictions further international trade disputes could create uncertainty tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company’s ability to move goods and services across borders or could impose added costs to those activities measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change in addition any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue natural disasters climate change impacts or uncertain political climates international hostilities or any terrorist activities could adversely affect customer demand the company’s operations and supply chain and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers for example on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared the novel coronavirus covid19 a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created volatility uncertainty and economic disruption

the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives on an ongoing basis ibm seeks to drive greater agility productivity flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation artificial intelligence agile processes and changes to the ways of working while also enabling the scaling of resources offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed quality productivity and enablement of rapid scaling which may impact the company’s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives

ineffective internal controls could impact the company’s business and operating results the company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation the company’s business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations

the company’s use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company’s financial results the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition including considering financial implications of the macroeconomic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the company’s most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm’s 2021 annual report to stockholders under “critical accounting estimates” in addition as discussed in note s “commitments  contingencies” in ibm’s 2021 annual report to stockholders the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment as a result actual financial results may differ

the company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may become impaired the company acquires other companies including the intangible assets of those companies the company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets if our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a charge to the consolidated income statement

the company depends on skilled employees and could be impacted by a shortage of critical skills much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service availability and integrity of skilled employees including technical marketing and staff resources skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills in addition as global opportunities and industry demand shifts realignment training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful further many of ibm’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards any new regulations volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company’s use or the value of the company’s equity awards putting the company at a competitive disadvantage

the company’s business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers ibm’s business employs a wide variety of components hardware and software supplies services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world certain of the company’s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market further the failure of the company’s suppliers to deliver components supplies services and raw materials in sufficient quantities in a timely or secure manner and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business in addition any defective components supplies or materials or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company’s products and services and harm the company’s reputation

product and service quality issues could impact the company’s business and operating results the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent detect and correct errors malfunctions and other defects in its products and services if errors malfunctions defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company’s operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers’ business operations and harm the company’s business’s operating results

the company could be impacted by its business with government clients the company’s customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the us including the us federal government and state and local entities some of the company’s agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services also some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses in addition the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations financial results and reputation

the company’s reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors resellers independent software vendors independent service providers and other ecosystem partners changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market as the company moves into new areas ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated ecosystem growth objectives in addition the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy 

cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company’s business there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers hacktivists nation states and competitors from intentional and unintentional acts of customers contractors business partners vendors employees and other third parties and from errors in processes or technologies as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers contractors business partners vendors employees and other third parties working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products services systems and networks using a wide variety of methods including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware software and infrastructure attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers contractors business partners vendors employees and other third parties to disclose information transfer funds or unwittingly provide access to systems or data the company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products services systems and networks but also those of customers contractors business partners vendors employees and other third parties particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations cyber threats are continually evolving making it difficult to defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time the company’s products services systems and networks including cloudbased systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers are used in critical company customer or thirdparty operations and involve the storage processing and transmission of sensitive data including valuable intellectual property other proprietary or confidential data regulated data and personal information of employees customers and others these products services systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries including those in the financial services healthcare critical infrastructure and government sectors successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in for example one or more of the following unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of company customer or other third party data or systems theft or import or export of sensitive regulated or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property including key innovations in artificial intelligence quantum or other disruptive technologies the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware crypto mining destructive attacks or other means and business delays service or system disruptions or denials of service in the event of such actions the company its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability litigation and regulatory or other government action including debarment as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to brand and reputation damage to our competitive position and other financial loss in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant in the company’s industry security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware software or other infrastructure elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers in addition the fastpaced evolving pervasive and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions practices and investments of customers contractors business partners vendors the open source community and other third parties including for example providing and implementing patches to address vulnerabilities cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power information technology communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company customer or other third party operations or services financial loss injury or death to persons or property potential liability and damage to brand and reputation although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security the company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities with the potential for exploitation and while the company continues to monitor for identify investigate respond to and remediate such events there have not been cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse effect in the future 

as a global enterprise the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company’s business including through increased risk increased costs and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of critical infrastructure iot devices customer industries eg financial services and 

various customer and government supply chain security programs as the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients the potential impact of regulations on the company’s business risks and reputation will grow accordingly the enactment and expansion of cybersecurity data protection and privacy laws regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms driven by the european court of justice decision in the schrems ii matter increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties the potential for damages fines and penalties and debarment and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance enforcement and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings 

risks related to laws and regulations 

the company could incur substantial costs related to climate change and other environmental matters ibm like other companies is subject to potential climaterelated risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events prolonged changes in temperature new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers carbon taxes and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients regulators and others the company is also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection including the us superfund law the company could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions as well as thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations we do not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position results of operations and competitive position

tax matters could impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions ibm’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd is issuing guidelines that are different in some respects than longstanding international tax principles as countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company’s income taxes local country state provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional federal national or similar forms of government in addition ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability

 item 1a risk factors

risks related to our business 

downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company’s business if overall demand for ibm’s products and solutions decreases whether due to general economic conditions including those associated with the covid19 pandemic or a shift in client buying patterns the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted

failure of innovation initiatives could impact the longterm success of the company ibm has been moving into areas including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud artificial intelligence blockchain iot quantum and other disruptive technologies in which it can differentiate itself through responsible innovation by leveraging its investments in rd and attracting a successful developer ecosystem if ibm is unable to continue its cuttingedge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins 

damage to ibm’s reputation could impact the company’s business ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and ai leader ibm’s reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients product defects internal control deficiencies delivery failures cybersecurity incidents government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners or joint venture partners if the company’s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions its ability to attract and retain customers talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted 

risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company’s business the company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the highvalue highly competitive and rapidlygrowing segments additionally emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services if the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences competitive actions emerging business models and ecosystems the client demand for our products or services may decline or ibm’s costs may increase 

ibm’s intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses the company’s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company’s nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company’s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company’s technology in addition the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties including nonpracticing entities also there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property including the ownership and protection of patents 

certain of the company’s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other thirdparty software licensed with limited or no warranties indemnification or other contractual protections for ibm further if open source code that ibm utilizes is no longer maintained developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers most of whom we do not employ we may be unable to develop new technologies adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation quality and price 

​ 

the announced spinoff of the company’s managed infrastructure services unit into a standalone publiclytraded company is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits on october 8 2020 the company announced its intention to separate the managed infrastructure services unit of its global technology services segment into a new independent public company currently referred to as newco completion of the announced spinoff as well as the timing of completion is subject to the readiness of newco to operate as an independent public company finalization of the financial statements of newco assurance that the separation will be taxfree for us federal income tax purposes finalization of the capital structure of the company and newco the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the us securities and exchange commission final approval of the ibm board of directors and other customary items the announced spinoff is complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions there is the potential for business disruption and as previously disclosed the company expects significant separation costs these or other unanticipated developments or costs could delay or prevent the announced spinoff or cause the announced spinoff to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated furthermore if the spinoff is completed there is no guarantee that it will be successful in meeting its objectives or achieving its intended benefits any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks to the company from acquisitions alliances and dispositions include integration challenges failure to achieve objectives the assumption of liabilities and higher debt levels the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions alliances and dispositions such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives including the company’s intention to separate the managed infrastructure services unit of its global technology services segment into a new and independent public company anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions as well as the failure to close planned transactions such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on ibm’s ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms from time to time the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company’s control 

the company’s financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict ibm’s revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases in addition certain of the company’s growth areas involve new products new customers new and evolving competitors and new markets all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results the company’s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers’ businesses for example certain of the company’s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes further general economic conditions including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the covid19 pandemic may impact the company’s financial results in any particular period as a result of the abovementioned factors the company’s financial results are difficult to predict historically the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter in addition the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter especially at the end of the fourth quarter make financial results for a given period difficult to predict 

due to the company’s global presence its business and operations could be impacted by local legal economic political health and other conditions including the covid19 pandemic the company is a globally integrated entity operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than fifty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies could affect the company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations further the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the us and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry the company’s 

results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries further as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings both within the us and globally it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks including compliance with us and foreign data privacy requirements data localization requirements labor relations laws enforcement of ip protection laws laws relating to anticorruption anticompetition regulations and import export and trade restrictions further international trade disputes could create uncertainty tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company’s ability to move goods and services across borders or could impose added costs to those activities measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change in addition any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue natural disasters climate change impacts or uncertain political climates international hostilities or any terrorist activities could adversely affect customer demand the company’s operations and supply chain and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers for example on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared the novel coronavirus covid19 a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in the current macroeconomic environment clients continue to balance shortterm challenges and opportunities for transformation their shortterm priorities continue to be focused on operational stability flexibility and cash preservation and as such we may experience some disruptions in transactional performance additionally clients’ shortterm priorities as well as quarantines limitations on travel and other factors associated with the covid19 pandemic may result in delays in some services projects another example the uk’s withdrawal from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” has caused global economic trade and regulatory uncertainty the company is actively monitoring and planning for possible impacts from brexit 

the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives on an ongoing basis ibm seeks to drive greater agility productivity flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation artificial intelligence agile processes and changes to the ways of working while also enabling the scaling of resources offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed quality productivity and enablement of rapid scaling which may impact the company’s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives 

ineffective internal controls could impact the company’s business and operating results the company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation the company’s business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations 

the company’s use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company’s financial results the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition including considering financial implications of the macroeconomic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the company’s most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm’s 2020 annual report to stockholders under “critical accounting estimates” in addition as discussed in note r “commitments  contingencies” in ibm’s 2020 annual report to stockholders the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment as a result actual financial results may differ 

the company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may become impaired the company acquires other companies including the intangible assets of those companies the company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets if our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a charge to the consolidated income statement

the company depends on skilled employees and could be impacted by a shortage of critical skills much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service availability and integrity of skilled employees including technical marketing and staff resources skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills in addition as global opportunities and industry demand shifts realignment training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful further many of ibm’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards any new regulations volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company’s use or the value of the company’s equity awards putting the company at a competitive disadvantage 

the company’s business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers ibm’s business employs a wide variety of components hardware and software supplies services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world certain of the company’s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market further the failure of the company’s suppliers to deliver components supplies services and raw materials in sufficient quantities in a timely manner and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business in addition any defective components supplies or materials or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company’s products and services and harm the company’s reputation 

product and service quality issues could impact the company’s business and operating results the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent detect and correct errors malfunctions and other defects in its products and services if errors malfunctions defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company’s operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers’ business operations and harm the company’s business’s operating results 

the company could be impacted by its business with government clients the company’s customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the us including the us federal government and state and local entities some of the company’s agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services also some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses in addition the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations financial results and reputation 

the company’s reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors resellers and ecosystem partners changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these distributors resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market as the company moves into new areas distributors resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives in addition the failure of third party distributors resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy

ibm strategy

ibm’s strategy begins with our clients ibm is distinguished as being first and foremost an enterprise company serving the world’s leaders in their industries

serving enterprises requires a distinct set of skills as our clients entrust us with building integrating and running the world’s missioncritical systems these are systems that cannot fail systems that require the highest levels of privacy and security they are built with our software and on our systems designed and managed by ibm services for example we manage approximately ninety percent of the credit card transactions and half of the world’s wireless connections we do this with an unparalleled commitment to our clients’ data security

we are unique in bringing innovative technology and industry expertise on a foundation of trust and security as an integrated proposition to our clients this integrated proposition allows us to deliver business impact that matters to our clients impact that requires bringing together technologies such as hybrid cloud data and ai insight with workflow and advanced industry skills this integrated proposition helps our clients transform themselves from traditional businesses to what we call cognitive enterprises

furthermore as technology becomes more central for business as well as in our personal lives trust matters more than ever for decades we have followed core principles grounded in commitments to trust and transparency that guide our responsible development and deployment of new technologies these values ground our business decisions inspire our employees and sustain our client relationships we have not only followed guidelines around the responsible handling of data and the stewardship of new technology but created them published them and invited others to adopt similar commitments our focus is not just on our direct client work but extends to society at large as we have been very active in areas such as education sustainability and security this is reinforced through a culture of inclusion and diversity all of ibm treats this “responsible stewardship” as core to our mission

a new chapter in technology

2019 ushered in chapter 2 of our clients’ digital journeys in which the two predominant technology forces of our day—hybrid cloud and dataai—are moving from “startup” to “production at scale” these two forces work together to help companies become what we call cognitive enterprises—companies that are powered by innovation agility and datadriven intelligent decision making

we describe below how ibm is leading the way in chapter 2

hybrid cloud

chapter 1 marked the early stages of cloud with the rise of public cloud this stage was focused on new enduser applications including applications that have allowed consumers to check their bank balances access social media make online purchases and receive online support while movement to public cloud has been strong only twenty percent of workloads have been addressed in chapter 1 clients are merely at the beginning of a multistage journey

chapter 2 is about clients modernizing the remaining eighty percent of workloads moving missioncritical workloads to the cloud and infusing ai deep into the decisionmaking of their businesses these missioncritical workloads include core financial transaction systems customer databases and enterprise resource planning systems some of these workloads will gravitate to the public cloud in chapter 2 while others will move to a private cloud or remain in traditional it environments for security compliance andor performance reasons

wherever clients’ workloads reside these environments must work together seamlessly to communicate share data and share capacity with enterprises having accumulated as many as fifteen public clouds each with its own means of management harmonizing these different clouds has become a necessity bringing these multiple public clouds private cloud and traditional it together is what we call hybrid cloud hybrid cloud defines the mission for chapter 2 in it

we are a leader in hybrid cloud and our mission in chapter 2 is to bring our expertise and experience in building and managing missioncritical systems to lead our enterprise clients along this multistage journey

our public cloud is built on a foundation of open source software and enterprise grade infrastructure it is the most open and secure public cloud and it is built for the enterprise with cloud paks—enterpriseready containerized software solutions for applications automation data integration and multicloud management

to accelerate our clients’ success we acquired red hat in 2019 further strengthening our leadership in hybrid cloud red hat is the world’s leader in open source technology including enterprise linux the operating system of the cloud as well as containers and openshift technology platforms that create seamless integration between traditional and cloud environments as the leader in open source red hat brings capability that enables applications to be “written once and run anywhere” in turn helping companies avoid lockin to a single cloud provider thereby taking advantage of the entire industry’s innovation these technologies are central to the next era of computing

our systems and services play a large role in these hybrid cloud offerings as well we have introduced new versions of our systems that work securely and seamlessly in the hybrid cloud bringing missioncritical workloads into our clients’ digital journeys through our services we play a large role in helping our clients map out their digital journeys and then helping them build manage and run the technology and the workflows

this integrated value proposition of innovative technology and industry expertise built on trust and security and now together with red hat is helping our clients realize the full potential and competitive advantage of the hybrid cloud

data and ai 

a new era of business reinvention is emerging as leading companies are moving from merely improving their processes to creating truly “intelligent workflows” processes that are not only efficient at what they do but intrinsically smart  capable of finding connecting and analyzing data to uncover deep insights that can inform intelligent decisions data and ai in concert with hybrid cloud are making intelligent workflows possible

we have been a pioneer of technologies and services that help clients collect organize and analyze their vast data stores and then operationalize ai across their business our longrunning innovation in automation data science and natural language processing is helping clients manage their data as a strategic resource and deploy ai for greater insight and more accurate trusted predictions

our data offerings help clients organize collect analyze and embed their data into their workflow ibm software spans areas ranging from data management and discovery to reporting governance compliance and risk management our systems process our clients’ data with unparalleled speed accuracy and security and our services help clients capture and embed the value of their data into their business

our ibm watson ai system has been named by industry analysts as the worldwide market leader in ai for three consecutive years watson is not only a leading ai technology but a leader in enterprise deployments in production and at scale in addition to extracting deep insight from data ibm watson allows clients to trace the origins of the data that their ai models use explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has not crept into results furthermore ibm watson is the only system that is built for the hybrid cloud able to work on numerous public and private clouds these innovations are making ai more consumable by everyday users not just data scientists

creating intelligent workflows relies on our integrated proposition of technology services and industry expertise built on a foundation of trust and security the way in which we bring these together is through an interactive process with our clients that we call the ibm garage a process of deep collaboration cocreation and innovation

    

we are in an era when our clients are embedding technology into their businesses in ways they have never done before technology is no longer merely a “tool” it is at the center of their businesses the source of their competitive advantage and the force behind their emerging business models

in chapter 2 ibm is bringing hybrid cloud and dataai together to help our clients reinvent themselves as cognitive enterprises the most challenging and complex work still lies ahead with our strong commitment to responsible stewardship and our integrated value proposition this makes us unique in helping our clients on their transformative digital journeys

 item 1a risk factors

downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets could impact the company’s business if overall demand for ibm’s products and solutions decreases whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted

the company may not meet its growth and productivity objectives under its internal business transformation and global integration initiatives on an ongoing basis ibm seeks to drive greater agility productivity flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation artificial intelligence agile processes and changes to the way the company works while also enabling the scaling of resources offerings and investments through the company’s globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets these various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed quality productivity and enablement of rapid scaling which may impact the company’s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives

failure of innovation initiatives could impact the longterm success of the company ibm has been moving into areas including those that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence blockchain iot quantum and other disruptive technologies in which it can differentiate itself through innovation by leveraging its investments in rd and attracting a successful developer ecosystem if ibm is unable to continue its cuttingedge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins 

damage to ibm’s reputation could impact the company’s business ibm has one of the strongest brand names in the world and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industryleading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader ibm’s reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients product defects internal control deficiencies delivery failures cybersecurity incidents government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients directors employees competitors vendors alliance partners or joint venture partners if the company’s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions its ability to attract and retain customers and talent could be impacted 

risks from investing in growth opportunities could impact the company’s business the company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the highvalue highly competitive and rapidlygrowing segments additionally emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services if the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences competitive actions emerging business models and ecosystems the client demand for our products or services may decline or ibm’s costs may increase 

ibm’s intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings and ibm may not be able to obtain necessary licenses the company’s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company’s nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company’s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company’s technology in addition the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties including nonpracticing entities also there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property including the ownership and protection of patents 

certain of the company’s offerings incorporate open source software licensed without warranties indemnification or other contractual protections if the code is no longer maintained by the relevant open source community then it may be more difficult to make the necessary revisions to the software including modifications to address security 

vulnerabilities which could impact ibm’s ability to market its products mitigate cybersecurity risks or fulfill its contractual obligations to customers

cybersecurity and privacy considerations could impact the company’s business there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers hacktivists nation states and competitors from intentional and unintentional acts of customers contractors business partners vendors employees and other third parties and from errors in processes or technologies computer hackers and others routinely attempt to attack the security of technology products services systems and networks such attacks may involve fraudulently inducing customers contractors business partners vendors employees and other third parties to disclose information transfer funds or unwittingly provide access to systems or data the company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products services systems and networks but also those of customers contractors business partners vendors employees and other third parties cyber threats are continually evolving making it difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time the company’s products services systems and networks including cloudbased systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers may be used in critical company customer or thirdparty operations and may involve the storage processing and transmission of sensitive data including valuable intellectual property other proprietary or confidential data regulated data and personal information of employees customers and others these products services systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries including those in the financial services healthcare critical infrastructure and government sectors successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in for example one or more of the following unauthorized access to disclosure modification misuse loss or destruction of company customer or other third party data or systems theft or import or export of sensitive regulated or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware crypto mining destructive attacks or other means and business delays service or system disruptions or denials of service in the event of such actions the company its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability litigation and regulatory or other government action as well as the loss of existing or potential customers damage to brand and reputation and other financial loss in addition the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant in the company’s industry security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware software or other infrastructure elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers in addition the fastpaced evolving pervasive and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company or its customers and may not be detected or remediated for some time afterward particularly if additional steps are required to implement remediationrelated updates cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions practices and investments of customers contractors business partners vendors and other third parties cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power information technology communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company customer or other third party operations or services financial loss injury or death to persons or property potential liability and damage to brand and reputation although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security to date while the company continues to monitor for identify investigate respond to and remediate security incidents including those associated with cybersecurity attacks there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company though there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity attack that has a material adverse effect in the future 

as a global enterprise the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company’s business including through increased risk increased costs and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations as the company’s reliance on data grows the potential impact of regulations on the company’s business risks and reputation will grow accordingly the enactment and expansion of data protection and privacy laws and regulations around the globe the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will continue to result in increased compliance costs and risks any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market

the company’s financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict ibm’s revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases in addition certain of the company’s growth areas involve new products new customers new and evolving competitors and new markets all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company’s financial results the company’s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers’ businesses for example certain of the company’s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes as a result of the abovementioned factors the company’s financial results are difficult to predict historically the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter in addition the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter especially at the end of the fourth quarter make financial results for a given period difficult to predict 

due to the company’s global presence its business and operations could be impacted by local legal economic political health and other conditions the company is a globally integrated entity operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the united states changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies could affect the company’s business and the company’s overall results of operations the company’s results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes including recessions inflation currency fluctuations between the us dollar and nonus currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries further as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings both within the us and globally it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks including compliance with us and foreign data privacy requirements data localization requirements labor relations laws enforcement of ip protection laws laws relating to anticorruption anticompetition regulations and import export and trade restrictions further international trade disputes could create uncertainty tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company’s ability to move goods and services across borders or could impose added costs to those activities measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change in addition any widespread outbreak of an illness pandemic or other local or global health issue natural disasters climate change impacts or uncertain political climates international hostilities or any terrorist activities could adversely affect customer demand the company’s operations and supply chain and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers for example the uk referendum to exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” has caused global economic trade and regulatory uncertainty the company is actively monitoring and planning for brexit 

the company could incur substantial costs for environmental matters the company is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection including the us superfund law the company could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions as well as thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and competitive position 

tax matters could impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions ibm’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd is issuing guidelines that are different in some respects than longstanding international tax principles as countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company’s income taxes local country state provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional federal national or similar forms of government in addition ibm is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the united states 

internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

the company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its us and nonus pension plans adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities as a result the company’s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted in addition in a period of an extended financial market downturn the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company’s financial flexibility further the company’s results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the united states premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue ibm’s 2019 annual report to stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters 

ineffective internal controls could impact the company’s business and operating results the company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation the company’s business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations 

the company’s use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact the company’s financial results the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition the company’s most critical accounting estimates are described in the management discussion in ibm’s 2019 annual report to stockholders under “critical accounting estimates” in addition as discussed in note r “commitments  contingencies” in ibm’s 2019 annual report to stockholders the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment as a result actual financial results may differ 

the company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may become impaired the company acquires other companies including the intangible assets of those companies the company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets if our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a charge to the consolidated income statement

the company depends on skilled employees and could be impacted by a shortage of critical skills much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service availability and integrity of skilled employees including technical marketing and staff resources skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills in addition as global opportunities and industry demand shifts realignment training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful further many of ibm’s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards any new regulations volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company’s use or the value of the company’s equity awards putting the company at a competitive disadvantage 

the company’s business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers ibm’s business employs a wide variety of components supplies services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world certain of the company’s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market further the failure of the company’s suppliers to deliver components supplies services and raw materials in sufficient quantities in a timely 

manner and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business in addition any defective components supplies or materials or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company’s products and services and harm the company’s reputation 

product quality issues could impact the company’s business and operating results the company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent detect and correct errors malfunctions and other defects in its products and services if errors malfunctions defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company’s operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers’ business operations and harm the company’s business’s operating results 

the company could be impacted by its business with government clients the company’s customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the us including the us federal government and state and local entities some of the company’s agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services also some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses in addition the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations financial results and reputation 

the company is exposed to currency and financing risks that could impact its revenue and business the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of nonus currencies and the us dollar further inherent in the company’s financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit client creditworthiness interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional it assets the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks including the use of derivative financial instruments which involve the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty in addition there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful 

the company’s financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and by customer credit risk on receivables the company’s financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide the company’s earnings and cash flows as well as its access to funding could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions ibm’s 2019 annual report to stockholders includes information about the company’s liquidity position the company’s client base includes many worldwide enterprises from small and medium businesses to the world’s largest organizations and governments with a significant portion of the company’s revenue coming from global clients across many sectors most of the company’s sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients’ financial conditions if the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses which could affect the company’s consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made 

the company’s reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors resellers and ecosystem partners changes in the business condition financial or otherwise of these distributors resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market as the company moves into new areas distributors resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives in addition the failure of third party distributors resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market 

risks to the company from acquisitions alliances and dispositions include integration challenges failure to achieve objectives the assumption of liabilities and higher debt levels the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions alliances and dispositions such transactions present significant challenges and risks and 

there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions as well as the failure to close planned transactions such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on ibm’s ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms from time to time the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company’s control 

the company is subject to legal proceedings and investigatory risks as a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries ibm is or may become involved as a party andor may be subject to a variety of claims demands suits investigations tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business the risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note r “commitments  contingencies” in ibm’s 2019 annual report to stockholders the company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs legal and compliance risks however will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time 

risk factors related to ibm securities the company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies the value of the company’s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest the maturity of the securities the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding the redemption features for the securities the level direction and volatility of interest rates changes in exchange rates exchange controls governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control the company’s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations as well as the other risks described under this item 1a entitled “risk factors” there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully

research development and intellectual property 

ibms research and development rd operations differentiate ibm from its competitors ibm annually spends approximately 56 billion for rd including capitalized software costs focusing its investments in highgrowth opportunities as a result of innovations in these and other areas ibm was once again awarded more us patents in 2004 than any other company this marks the 12th year in a row that ibm achieved this distinction 

in addition to producing worldclass hardware and software products ibm innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the companys clients through its growing services activities the companys investments in rd also result in intellectual property ip income some of ibms technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in ibm products while others are used by the companys licensees for their products when that new technology is not strategic to ibms business goals a third group is both used internally and licensed externally 

in addition to these ip income sources the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through crosslicensing arrangements and ip licensed in divestiture transactions the value of these other two sources is not readily apparent in the financial results and consolidated statement of earnings because income on crosslicensing arrangements is recorded only to the extent cash is received the value received by ibm for ip involving the sale of a business is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture not in the separately displayed ip income amounts in financial results and consolidated statement of earnings 

in january 2005 ibm announced that it would pledge 500 of its patents for use by the open computing community representing a major shift in the way ibm manages and deploys its intellectual property portfolio ibms intent is to help form an industrywide patent commons in which patents are used to establish a platform for further innovation in areas of broad interest to information technology developers and users the pledge is applicable to any individual community or company working on or using software that meets the open source initiative osi definition of open source software 

integrated supply chain 

just as ibm works to transform its clients supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to market conditions ibm has undertaken a largescale initiative to recast its own integrated supply chain as an on demand business operation turning what had previously been an expense to be managed into a strategic advantage for the company and ultimately improved delivery and outcomes for its clients ibm spends approximately 41 billion annually through its supply chain procuring materials and services around the world the companys supply manufacturing and distribution operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable costs simplifying and streamlining internal operations has improved sales force productivity and processes and thereby the experiences of the companys clients when working with ibm because some of the cost savings this unit generates are passed along to clients they will not always result in a visible gross margin improvement in the companys consolidated statement of earnings while these efforts are largely concerned with product manufacturing and delivery ibm is also applying supply chain principles to service delivery across its solutions and services lines of business to accomplish this ibm is creating a new labor resource management system—based on a uniform taxonomy of skills—that will enable the organization to more efficiently match its labor resources to the needs of ibm clients deploy the right expertise quickly and create a better shortterm and longterm balance of labor supply and demand by comparing the demands of the market against the database of available skills 

in addition to its own manufacturing operations the company uses a number of contract manufacturing cm companies around the world to manufacture ibmdesigned products the use of cm companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce timetomarket for certain ibm products some of the companys relationships with cm companies are exclusive the company has key relationships with sanminasci for the manufacture of some intelbased products and with solectron for a significant portion of the manufacturing operations of global asset recovery services—an operation of global financing that restores endoflease personal computers and other it equipment for resale 

significant factors affecting ibms business 

forwardlooking and cautionary statements certain statements contained in this annual report may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 reform act the company may also make forwardlooking statements in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases in addition the companys representatives may from time to time make oral forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact words such as anticipates believes expects estimates intends plans projects and similar expressions may identify such forwardlooking statements the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements in accordance with the reform act set forth below are cautionary statements that accompany those forwardlooking statements readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends the following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report in the companys filing with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference 

economic environment and corporate it spending budgets if overall demand for hardware software and services changes whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns sales performance could be impacted ibms diverse portfolio of products and offerings is designed to gain market share in strong and weak economic climates the company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with longterm cash and income streams as well as cyclical transactionbased sales but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base ibm continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends focusing on client or industryspecific solutions business performance and open standards 

internal business transformation and efficiency initiatives ibm continues to drive greater productivity and cost savings as it transforms itself into an on demand enterprise this includes the internal supply chain initiatives discussed above as well as driving collaboration across the ibm enterprise to stimulate innovation and drive growth transformation efforts are improving the companys management of its costs worldwide the rebalancing of skills optimizing its workforce to drive growth keeping the companys compensation programs competitive and creating a cost efficient and cuttingedge it infrastructure to support its transformation ibm is extending its supply chain initiatives to labor costs and other internal processes continued success in this area will impact the companys cost structure improvements as well as the amount of competitive leverage it can apply by passing savings along to clients 

innovation initiatives ibm invests for new and innovative capabilities products and services ibm has been moving away from commoditized categories of the it industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in rd examples include ibms leadership position in the design and fabrication of asics the design of smaller faster and energyefficient semiconductor devices the design of grid computing networks that allow computers to share processing power the transformation and integration of business processes and the companys efforts to advance open technology standards and to engage with governments academia think tanks and nongovernmental organizations on emerging trends in technology society and culture in the highly competitive it industry with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single technology competitors ibms ability to continue its cuttingedge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share ibm is managing this risk by more closely linking its rd organization to industryspecific and clientspecific needs as discussed in description of business—ibm worldwide organizations 

open standards the broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms the integration of any clients internal systems applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task the broadbased acceptance of open standards—rather than closed proprietary architectures—also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb and thus benefit from new technical innovations ibm is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the on demand operating environment and because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and it industry there are a number of competitors in the it industry with significant resources and investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture this competition will result in increased pricing pressure andor ip claims and proceedings ibms support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as linux and the development of rational software development tools which can be used to develop and upgrade any other companys software products 

emerging business opportunities the company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing—providing technology and transformation services to clients businesses consistent with that focus the company continues to significantly invest in emerging business opportunities as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gain areas of investment 

include strategic acquisitions primarily in software and services informationbased medicine on demand retail sensor and actuator solutions business performance transformation services key technologies power5 and powerblade and emerging growth countries such as china russia india and brazil 

protection of intellectual property while the companys various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success ibm believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license or any particular group of patents or licenses ibm owns or is licensed under a number of patents which vary in duration relating to its products licenses under patents owned by ibm have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions these protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the companys nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the companys technology also there can be no assurances that ibm will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future 

relationships with critical suppliers ibms business employs a wide variety of components supplies services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world certain of the companys businesses rely on single or limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises the failure of the companys suppliers to deliver components supplies services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the companys business 

seasonality of revenues ibms revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases as a result the companys results are difficult to predict these factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter 

local legal and economic conditions the company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of its revenues from sales outside the united states changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the companys business in that country and the companys results of operations the companys results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes including recessions and inflation 

environmental matters the company is subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection including the us superfund law the company could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions as well as thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys capital expenditures earnings and competitive position 

internal controls effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud if the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud the companys brand and operating results could be harmed pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its 

internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation the companys business and operating results could be harmed the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price 

competitive conditions the company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures the companys businesses face a significant number of competitors ranging from fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations the company believes that its combination of technology performance quality reliability price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors 

intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the companys products and services resulting in reduced profit margins andor loss of market opportunity unlike many of its competitors the company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines as a result the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete 

volatility of stock prices the companys stock price is affected by a number of factors including quarterly variations in results the competitive landscape general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community as a result like other technology companies the companys stock price is subject to significant volatility 

dependence on and compensation of key personnel much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel including technical marketing and staff positions experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs many of the companys key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards new regulations volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the companys use and the value of the companys equity awards putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation 

currency and customer financing risks the company derives a significant percentage of its nonus revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of nonus currencies and the us dollar further inherent in the companys customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the client interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values the company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks including the use of derivative financial instruments derivatives involve the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty in addition there can be no assurance that the companys efforts to manage these risks will be successful 

distribution channels the company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market 

acquisitions and alliances the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully 

backlog the value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues from the companys product offerings due to the significant proportion of revenue from services the volume of products delivered from shelf inventories and the shortening of product delivery schedules with respect to the companys global services segment in 2004 the company signed contracts totaling 43 billion which contributed to a services backlog at december 31 2004 of 111 billion compared with 120 billion at the end of 2003
